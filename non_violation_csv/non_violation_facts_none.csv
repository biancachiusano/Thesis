0,in and lives in kragujevac at the relevant time he was a journalist and an editorinchief of svetlost a weekly news magazine based in the same town the applicant was represented by ms d rakićević a lawyer practising in kragujevac the government were represented by their agent ms z jadrijević mladar the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows the published articles on june svetlost published an article titled shame through silence ćutanjem do crvenila this piece written by the applicant in so far as relevant reads as follows kragujevac has reason to be ashamed towards the end of april the head of a municipal branch office in d firstly in the city centre and in front of the main post office building falsely introduced himself to a street vendor as a market inspector and then invited her into his car under the pretext that certain documents had to be copied thereafter he drove the girl away with him to karađorđeva street where he tried to rape her the girl was under age and of romani origin her resistance screams and crying ultimately thwarted the assailant the underaged girl was warned not to tell anyone what had happened and had to give her telephone number the next day when the head of the municipal branch office called her and arranged to meet her he was met by the police and arrested he was also detained for a period of fortyeight hours and then brought before an investigating judge the assailant was charged with false impersonation unlawful deprivation of liberty and attempted rape the proceedings have commenced and they shall of course have their conclusion the local police otherwise very prompt when it comes to informing the public even of much lesser offences simply kept silent about the incident the press also received no information from the investigating judge or the public prosecution service which has otherwise also been cooperative with respect to providing information concerning its activities this magazine indirectly found out about the horrific ordeal suffered by our underaged fellow citizen the police only provided us with information following receipt of our written request asking them to confirm or deny the details which we had learnt from others nongovernmental organisations focused on romani rights issues also stayed quiet the case of an underaged street vendor was probably not a priority for their rich donors the city administration likewise did nothing with respect to their own official why did they all remain silent uncomfortable questions will soon have to be answered by those in power did the police keep quiet about the attempted rape just because it concerned a romani girl did anyone and if so who from the city administration intervene in order to cover up the shameful incident was the idea to thereby buy time so as to make it possible for the head of the municipal branch office to strike a deal with the gypsies until they are paid off to withdraw their complaint of attempted rape lastly but most importantly whose interest is it in to protect the bully who is getting his salary paid from the municipal budget while in his free time attempting to rape his underaged fellow citizens for as long as these questions remain unanswered by those in power the city of kragujevac will be unable to remove its shame regarding this incident on the same date that is june svetlost published another article regarding the alleged incident titled the false inspector from d near kragujevac attempted to rape an underaged girl lažni inspektor iz d kod kragujevca pokušao da siluje maloletnicu this piece written by ms a a journalist employed with svetlost in so far as relevant reads as follows mr b the head of the municipal branch office in the village of d near

deprivation of liberty and performing illicit sexual acts on an underaged girl as confirmed to svetlost by the police the criminal complaint against mr b was lodged by an underaged girl who together with her mother had been selling on april th of this year and in front of the main post office building in kragujevac minor domestic supplies the police explored the allegations and after fortyeight hours of detention brought mr b before an investigating judge despite the incident having taken place in late april the police did not issue their usual press release until they received our request in this regard the criminal complaint lodged by the underaged girl states that on april th at around pm mr b introduced himself as a market inspector and told them that they could freely sell their merchandise in front of the post office building because he was in charge of that area one hour later he returned with his car in front of the post office building and invited the girl to approach the vehicle when the girl came near mr b told her to enter the car in order to sign a document and then locked the front passenger door and drove away with her from the scene he explained to the girl that certain documents had to be copied and started touching her leg according to the criminal complaint the girl then told the false inspector that she could not leave her mother but mr b asked her to calm down while parking his car in karađorđeva street he started touching her and kissing her on the neck and the girl started screaming but he then turned on the music loudly in his vehicle mr b tore the buttons off of her trousers and the clip off of her bra the girl punched against the car windows while mr b told her to calm down and that he would not touch her again he then drove her away to nikola pašić street proposed that they have a coffee together and told her not to tell anyone about what had happened one day later mr b called the girl on the phone her mother answered and an arrangement was made for the meeting to take place in front of the post office building there instead of being met by the girl mr b was met by the police and taken to the police station as noted above at the time of publication of the two articles the applicant was also the editorinchief of svetlost the first and second articles were published on pages and of the news magazine respectively the criminal proceedings following a preliminary criminal investigation on july mr b was charged by the kragujevac public prosecutors office osnovno javno tužilaštvo u kragujevcu in connection with the abovedescribed incident the charges alleged that he had committed the crimes of unlawful deprivation of liberty protivpravno lišenje slobode and illicit performance of sexual acts nedozvoljene polne radnje the kragujevac court of first instance osnovni sud u kragujevcu thereafter heard the defendant and the alleged victim as well as a number of witnesses it furthermore took into account the statements given and the documentation obtained in the course of the preliminary proceedings in the meantime on september the alleged victim provided the court with her own as well her mothers courtcertified statements of september wherein they both fully recanted their earlier testimony accusing mr b of the crimes in question on december the kragujevac court of first instance acquitted mr b of all charges on june following a remittal on appeal the same court again acquitted mr b of all charges on december this judgment was upheld by the kragujevac appeals court apelacioni sud u kragujevcu at second instance and it thereby became final the civil proceedings in july mr b lodged a civil defamation claim with the kragujevac high court viši sud u kragujevcu against the applicant ms a and svetlost regarding the two published articles on december this court ruled partly in favour of mr b and ordered the applicant and svetlost only not ms a to pay him jointly a total of serbian dinars rsd as well as statutory interest as of that date on account of the mental anguish suffered as a consequence of the breach of his honour and reputation plus rsd in litigation costs the court furthermore ordered the said two respondents to publish this judgment without comment or delay in their own news magazine the kragujevac high court explained as regards the first article and with specific reference to paragraph thereof that inter alia the applicant as its author had stated as fact that mr b had committed the crimes of unlawful deprivation of liberty false impersonation and attempted rape despite the fact that the criminal proceedings against the latter had still been pending thereby breaching his right to be presumed innocent furthermore the applicant had included an untrue statement of fact when he had reported that mr b had committed the crime of attempted rape even though he had known that the police had not pressed charges for that particular criminal offence see paragraph above with respect to the second article prepared by ms a and specifically as regards paragraphs and thereof the court rejected the plaintiffs claim noting that this piece had been written accurately based on the information provided by the police themselves see paragraph above lastly the court noted the existence of the statement of september see paragraph above but reiterated that it had no bearing on the present case since it had been given after the publication of the articles in question on april the kragujevac appeals court partly amended the judgment delivered at first instance in so doing it ordered the applicant ms a and svetlost to pay mr b jointly a total of rsd approximately euros eur at the time on account of the mental anguish suffered as a consequence of the breach of his honour and reputation as well as statutory interest from december plus rsd in litigation costs approximately eur at the time the obligation on the part of the respondents to publish the judgment was upheld in its reasoning which was essentially along the lines of that offered by the kragujevac high court the kragujevac appeals court nevertheless held inter alia that a the award of rsd had been excessive given the existing interest of the public to be informed of the incident in question albeit in a more appropriate manner b ms a had also incorrectly stated as fact in the title of her piece despite the more accurate text just below it that mr b had attempted to rape an underaged girl and c mr b could not be considered a public figure and as such someone who should have had to withstand more criticism since he had merely been employed as the head of a municipal branch office and had not been a local government official službenik u teritorijalnoj jedinici lokalne

entire property would be subject to enforcement izvršenje na celokupnoj imovini according to the information provided by the applicant since may he had been unemployed and lacking any movable assets of relevance to the enforcement procedure this was also why the civil judgments in question had not yet been enforced the applicant however stated that he did own a flat in which he had been living with his family and that mr b could yet seek enforcement on this property the government confirmed that as of april the civil judgments at issue remained unenforced other relevant facts in his statement given to the kragujevac high court on october as part of the civil defamation proceedings mr b recounted that after the publication of the articles in question he had called the applicant and had asked him why such pieces had been published at all the applicant in response had offered him the opportunity to deny the allegations in the newsmagazines next issue but mr b had refused this offer because he had not wanted to debate the matter through the media lastly mr b had informed the applicant that he would instead be bringing legal proceedings in this regard on june mr b visited a neuropsychiatrist allegedly as a consequence of the distress which he had suffered due to the publication of the articles on the same date he was also provided with a certificate attesting that he was

1,the applicant was born in and lives in weinheim he is a campaigner against abortion and operates an antiabortion website on november and december the applicant distributed leaflets in the immediate vicinity of the medical practice of dr s the leaflets contained inter alia the following text on the front page did you know that dr s full name and address performs abortions that are unlawful according to the caselaw of the federal constitutional court wussten sie schon dass dr s abtreibungen durchführt die nach der rechtsprechung des bundesverfassungsgerichts rechtswidrig sind underneath the following was in smaller type according to international criminal law aggravated murder is the intentional bringingtodeath of an innocent human being sinngemӓβ aus den internationalen strafgesetzen mord ist das vorsӓtzliche zu tode bringen eines unschuldigen menschen the back side of the folded leaflet contained the following text the aggravated murder of human beings in auschwitz was unlawful but the morally degraded ns state allowed the aggravated murder of innocent people and did not make it subject to criminal liability die ermordung der menschen in auschwitz war rechtswidrig aber der moralisch verkommene nsstaat hatte den mord an den unschuldigen menschen erlaubt und nicht unter strafe gestellt the applicant further quoted parts of the federal constitutional courts leading judgment of may bverf ge see paragraph below with regard to abortion and a statement by christoph wilhelm hufeland the personal physician of goethe and schiller he also cited section of the conflicts in pregnancy act see paragraph below and asked readers to make use of their influence on those performing and assisting in abortions by a letter of december dr s requested that the applicant sign a declaration to cease and desist the applicant refused and published the following statement on his website if dr s full name by carrying out abortions publicly shows that he agrees with abortions then he should stand by his opinion instead dr s considers the leaflet campaign to be slander threatens an interim injunction and has already given his lawyer a mandate to lodge a criminal complaint for defamationslander we ask ourselves is dr s unprincipled and characterless wenn dr s mit der durchführung von abtreibungen öffentlich bekundet dass er für abtreibungen ist dann sollte er auch dazu stehen stattdessen sieht dr s in der flugblatt verteilaktion eine rufmordkampagne droht mit einer einstweiligen verfügung und hat bereits seinem rechtsanwalt die vollmacht gegeben eine strafanzeige wegen beleidigung verleumdung zu erwirken wir fragen uns ist dr s stand und charakterlos subsequently dr s applied to the karlsruhe regional court for a civil injunction ordering the applicant not to claim on the internet that the plaintiff performed unlawful abortions and not to disseminate leaflets containing his name and the assertion that unlawful abortions were performed in his medical practice he also lodged a claim for nonpecuniary damages in the amount of euros eur and for pretrial legal fees on september the date of the oral hearing before the karlsruhe regional court the applicant distributed a second leaflet directly in front of dr ss practice among other places the applicant deposited this second leaflet in which dr s was not mentioned by name into letterboxes in the immediate vicinity of the latters practice the following sentence was on the front side of the leaflet near you unlawful abortions and you are silent about the aggravated murder of our children in ihrer nähe rechtswidrige abtreibungen und sie schweigen zum mord an unseren kindern emphases in original the back of the folded leaflet contained the following text these prenatal infanticides have meanwhile taken on proportions that bring to mind a new holocaust diese vorgeburtlichen kindstötungen haben mittlerweile ausmaße angenommen welche an einen neuen holocaust erinnern emphases in original farther down the leaflet read im simply unable to understand that medical personnel and doctors who are supposed to help and save lives stoop to take part in aggravated murder noch weniger kann ich verstehen dass mediziner und ärzte welche helfen und leben retten sollen sich fürs morden hergeben on november the karlsruhe regional court granted the requested injunction and ordered the applicant to desist from asserting publicly both in writing and orally on the internet as well as on leaflets that the plaintiff performed unlawful abortions in his medical practice in addition the regional court awarded compensation for the pecuniary damage requested by the plaintiff eur and dismissed the claim in respect of nonpecuniary damage the court held that the applicants statements were protected by freedom of expression and contributed to a public debate moreover they had to be classified as statements of fact and as such the information that abortions were unlawful was in line with the judgment of the constitutional court and not incorrect however when read in conjunction with the whole leaflet the statements had a pillory effect and amounted to a serious interference with dr ss personality rights which was not justified by the applicants freedom of expression the court came to this conclusion based on the facts that the applicant had singled out dr s by mentioning him by name and distributing the leaflets in the vicinity of his practice that he had quoted the federal constitutional courts judgment only in parts and had omitted the parts that stated that doctors had not been subject to criminal liability that he had implied by defining aggravated murder that dr s had committed this criminal offence and that he had associated dr s with the holocaust nonetheless in regard to nonpecuniary damage the court concluded that even though the attacks on dr ss reputation had been grave enough to justify the injunction they had not been sufficiently serious to justify nonpecuniary damage the applicant and dr s appealed against the regional courts decision additionally dr s expanded his action to include the second leaflet see paragraph above which subsequently became the subject matter of the judgment of the karlsruhe court of appeal on february the karlsruhe court of appeal confirmed the reasoning of the regional court and in essence dismissed both appeals however it partly modified the regional courts judgment concerning the precise wording of the requested injunction it ordered the applicant to desist from asserting in public that dr s performed unlawful abortions in his medical practice and asserting in direct connection to this that aggravated murder is the intentional bringingtodeath of an innocent human being the court of appeal further ordered the applicant to desist from asserting that dr s performed unlawful abortions causing infanticide at the outset it emphasised that the applicants view that abortions should be subject to criminal liability and were not compatible with higherranking law fell within the applicants freedom of expression however the court also noted that the very wording of the applicants statements showed that he labelled abortions as performed by the plaintiff aggravated murder which could not be tolerated neither if the statements were considered statements of fact nor if considered value judgments in the courts view the applicant had created an unacceptable pillory effect by singling out the plaintiff who had not given the applicant any reason to do so in that regard the court noted that dr s had not been involved in the public debate about abortions in any way in regard to the second leaflet the court of appeal held that even though dr s had not been mentioned by name it had referred to him as it had been distributed in front of his medical practice and deposited in letterboxes in the vicinity similarly to the first leaflet a not negligible part of the readers would have understood from the leaflet that dr ss professional activities had constituted aggravated murder however even if understood in a nonlegal sense the leaflet had made it understood that the applicant had conducted illegal and punishable abortions since the applicant had not clarified that he had only been criticising abortions which were according to the caselaw of the federal constitutional court see paragraph below unlawful but not subject to criminal liability he had exceeded the limits of justifiable criticism as to the claim for damages the court of appeal upheld the firstinstance judgment it also did not grant leave to appeal on points of law on may the federal court of justice refused a request by the applicant for legal aid for his complaint against the denial of leave to appeal on points of law on the grounds that the applicants intended appeal on points of law lacked sufficient prospect of success on july the federal constitutional court

a system of notifyandtakedown in place any reader could mark a comment as leim an estonian word for an insulting or mocking message or a message inciting hatred on the internet and the comment was removed expeditiously furthermore there was a system of automatic deletion of comments that included certain stems of obscene words in addition a victim of a defamatory comment could directly notify the applicant company in which case the comment was removed immediately the applicant company had made efforts to advise users that the comments were not its opinion and that the authors of comments were responsible for their content on delfis internet site there were rules of comment which included the following the delfi message board is a technical medium allowing users to publish comments delfi does not edit comments an author of a comment is liable for hisher comment it is worth noting that there have been cases in the estonian courts where authors have been punished for the contents of a comment delfi prohibits comments the content of which does not comply with good practice these are comments that contain threats contain insults incite hostility and violence incite illegal activities contain obscene expressions and vulgarities delfi has the right to remove such comments and restrict their authors access to the writing of comments the functioning of the noticeandtakedown system was also explained in the text the government submitted that in estonia delfi had a notorious history of publishing defaming and degrading comments thus on september the weekly newspaper eesti ekspress had published a public letter from the editorial board to the minister of justice the chief public prosecutor and the chancellor of justice in which concern was expressed about incessant taunting of people on public websites in estonia delfi was named as a source of brutal and arrogant mockery b article and comments published on the internet news portal on january the applicant

i also shit onto his head on the same day the offensive comments were removed by the applicant company on march the applicant company responded to the request from ls lawyers it informed l that the comments had been removed under the noticeandtakedown obligation and refused the claim for damages c civil proceedings against the applicant company on april l brought a civil suit with the harju county court against the applicant company at the hearing of may the representatives of the applicant company submitted inter alia that in cases like the bronze night public disorders related to the relocation of the bronze soldier monument in april delfi had removed comments per day also on its own initiative by a judgment of june ls claim was dismissed the county court found that the applicant companys responsibility was excluded under the information society services act infoühiskonna teenuse seadus which was based on the directive on electronic commerce directive ec of the european parliament and of the council of june on certain legal aspects of information society services in particular electronic commerce in the internal market the court considered that the comment environment in the applicant companys news portal was to be distinguished from the portals journalistic area the administration of the former by the applicant company was essentially of a mechanical and passive nature the applicant company could not be considered the publisher of the comments nor did it have any obligation to monitor them on october the tallinn court of appeal allowed ls appeal it considered that the county court had erred in finding that the applicant companys responsibility was excluded under the information society services act the county courts judgment was quashed and the case referred back to the firstinstance court for new consideration on january the supreme court declined to hear the applicant companys appeal on june the harju county court having reexamined the case found for l in accordance with the court of appeals instructions it relied on the obligations act võlaõigusseadus and deemed the information society services act inapplicable it observed that the applicant company had placed a note on its internet site that comments were not edited that it was prohibited to post comments that were contrary to good practice and that the applicant company reserved to itself the right to remove such comments a system was put in place whereby users could notify the applicant company of any inappropriate comments however the county court considered that this was insufficient and did not allow adequate protection for the personality rights of others the court found that the applicant company itself was to be considered the publisher of the comments and it could not avoid responsibility by publishing a disclaimer that it was not liable for the content of the comments the county court found that the news article itself published in the delfi news portal was a balanced one a number of comments however were vulgar in form they were humiliating and defamatory and impaired ls honour dignity and reputation the comments went beyond justified criticism and amounted to simple insults the court concluded that freedom of expression did not extend to protection of the comments concerned and that ls personality rights had been violated l was awarded eek eur in nonpecuniary damages on december the tallinn court of appeal upheld the county courts judgment it emphasised that the applicant company had not been required to exercise preliminary control over comments posted on its news portal however having chosen not to do so it should have created some other effective system which would have ensured rapid removal of unlawful comments from the portal the court of appeal considered that the measures taken by the applicant company were insufficient and that it was contrary to the principle of good faith to place the burden of monitoring the comments on their potential victims the court of appeal rejected the applicant companys argument that its responsibility was excluded on the basis of the information society services act it noted that the applicant company was not a technical intermediary in respect of the comments and that its activity was not of a merely technical automatic and passive nature instead it invited users to add comments thus the applicant company was a provider of content services rather than of technical services on june the supreme court dismissed the applicant companys appeal it upheld the court of appeals judgment in substance but partly modified its reasoning the supreme court approved the lower courts interpretation of the information society services act and reiterated that an information society service provider falling under that act and the directive on electronic commerce had neither knowledge of nor control over information which was transmitted or stored by contrast a provider of content services governed the content of information that was being stored in the present case the applicant company had integrated the comment environment into its news portal and invited users to post comments the number of comments had an effect on the number of visits to the portal and on the applicant companys revenue from advertisements published on the portal thus the applicant company had an economic interest in the comments the fact that the applicant company did not write the comments itself did not imply that it had no control over the comment environment it enacted the rules of comment and removed comments if the rules were breached the users on the contrary could not change or delete the comments they had posted they could merely report obscene comments thus the applicant company could determine which comments were published and which not the fact that it made no use of this possibility did not mean that it had no control over the publishing of the comments furthermore the supreme court considered that in the present case both the applicant company and the authors of the comments were to be considered publishers of the comments in this context it also referred to the economic interest of an internet portals administrator which made it a publisher as entrepreneur similarly to a publisher of printed media the supreme court found that the plaintiff was free to choose against whom to bring the suit and l had chosen to bring the suit against the applicant company the supreme court found that on the basis of its legal obligation to avoid causing damage to other persons the applicant company should have prevented clearly unlawful comments from being published furthermore after the comments had been published it had failed to remove them on its own initiative although it must have been aware of their unlawfulness the courts had rightly found that the applicant companys failure to act had been unlawful d subsequent developments according to information posted on october by delfi on its internet portal delfi did not allow persons who had posted offensive comments to post a new comment until the commenter had read and accepted the rules of commenting furthermore it was announced that delfi had set up a team of moderators who carried out followup moderation of comments posted on the portal first of all the moderators reviewed all user notices of inappropriate comments the compliance of comments with the rules of commenting was monitored as well according to the information published the number of comments posted by delfis readers

electronic commerce in the internal market directive on electronic commerce stressing that freedom of communication on the internet should not prejudice the human dignity human rights and fundamental freedoms of others especially minors considering that a balance has to be found between respecting the will of users of the internet not to disclose their identity and the need for law enforcement authorities to trace those responsible for criminal acts declare that they seek to abide by the following principles in the field of communication on the internet principle content rules for the internet member states should not subject content on the internet to restrictions which go further than those applied to other means of content delivery principle absence of prior state control public authorities should not through general blocking or filtering measures deny access by the public to information and other communication on the internet regardless of frontiers this does not prevent the installation of filters for the protection of minors in particular in places accessible to them such as schools or libraries provided that the safeguards of article paragraph of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms are respected measures may be taken to enforce the removal of clearly identifiable internet content or alternatively the blockage of access to it if the competent national authorities have taken a provisional or final decision on its illegality principle limited liability of service providers for internet content member states should not impose on service providers a general obligation to monitor content on the internet to which they give access that they transmit or store nor that of actively seeking facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity member states should ensure that service providers are not held liable for content on the internet when their function is limited as defined by national law to transmitting information or providing access to the internet in cases where the functions of service providers are wider and they store content emanating from other parties member states may hold them coresponsible if they do not act expeditiously to remove or disable access to information or services as soon as they become aware as defined by national law of their illegal nature or in the event of a claim for damages of

of the treaty this directive is not intended to affect national fundamental rules and principles relating to freedom of expression the exemptions from liability established in this directive cover only cases where the activity of the information society service provider is limited to the technical process of operating and giving access to a communication network over which information made available by third parties is transmitted or temporarily stored for the sole purpose of making the transmission more efficient this activity is of a mere technical automatic and passive nature which implies that the information society service provider has neither knowledge of nor control over the information which is transmitted or stored a service provider can benefit from the exemptions for mere conduit and for caching when he is in no way involved with the information transmitted this requires among other things that he does not modify the information that he transmits this requirement does not cover manipulations of a technical nature which take place in the course of the transmission as they do not alter the integrity of the information contained in the transmission a service provider who deliberately collaborates with one of the recipients of his service in order to undertake illegal acts goes beyond the activities of mere conduit or caching and as a result can not benefit from the liability exemptions established for these activities the limitations of the liability of intermediary service providers established in this directive do not affect the possibility of injunctions of different kinds such injunctions can in particular consist of orders by courts or administrative authorities requiring the termination or prevention of any infringement including the removal of illegal information or the disabling of access to it in order to benefit from a limitation of liability the provider of an information society service consisting of the storage of information upon obtaining actual knowledge or awareness of illegal activities has to act expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information concerned the removal or disabling of access

obligation on service providers only with respect to obligations of a general nature this does not concern monitoring obligations in a specific case and in particular does not affect orders by national authorities in accordance with national legislation this directive does not affect the possibility for member states of requiring service providers who host information provided by recipients of their service to apply duties of care which can reasonably be expected from them and which are specified by national law in order to detect and prevent certain types of illegal activities article

european union in a judgment of march joined cases c to c google france and google ecr i the court of justice of the european union considered that in order to establish whether the liability of a referencing service provider may be limited under article of directive it is necessary to examine whether the role played by that service provider is neutral in the sense that its conduct is merely technical automatic and passive pointing to a lack of knowledge or control of the data which it stores article of the directive on electronic commerce must be interpreted as meaning that the rule laid down therein applies to an internet referencing service provider in the event that that service provider has not played an active role of such a kind as to give it knowledge of or control over the data stored if it has not played such a role that service provider can not be held liable for the data which it has stored at the request of an advertiser unless having obtained knowledge of the unlawful nature of those data or of that advertisers activities it failed to act expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the data concerned in a judgment of july case c loréal and others the court of justice of the european union ruled that article of directive was to be interpreted as applying to the operator of an online marketplace where that operator had not played an active role allowing it to have knowledge or control of the data stored the operator played such a role when it provided assistance which entailed in particular optimising the presentation of the offers for sale in question or promoting them where the operator of the online marketplace had not played such an active role and the service provided fell as a consequence within the scope of article of directive the operator none the less could not in a case which could result in an order to pay damages rely on the exemption from liability provided for under that article if it had been aware of facts or

3,is a newspaper published in baku it has legal personality under azerbaijani law the second applicant a founder and the editorinchief of khural was born in and lives in baku the applicants were represented by mr e sadigov and mr r hajili lawyers based in baku and strasbourg respectively the government were represented by their agent mr ç əsgərov the facts of the case may be summarised as follows civil defamation proceedings against the first applicant on may an article concerning a wellknown highranking government official the head of the presidential administration mr ramiz mehdiyev rm and his alleged relationships with a prominent azerbaijani poet bakhtiyar vahabzade bv and the exhead of the executive authority in sheki ashraf mammadov am was published in khural the title of the article was ramiz mehdiyevs plan to finish bakhtiyar vahabzade why did the head of the presidential administration have to punish the sheki community and the head of its executive authority relevant extracts from the article appear in paragraph below mr elchin ugurtaj was mentioned as the author of the article from the material submitted to the court it is not clear whether the name in question was that of a real person or a pen name in june rm lodged a civil action against the first applicant with the narimanov district court arguing that the abovementioned article contained false statements damaging his honour dignity and professional reputation rm asked the court to order the first applicant to issue an apology and refutation and to pay azerbaijani manats azn for nonpecuniary damage to be transferred to an orphanage rm argued in particular that the title of the impugned article and certain extracts from it were defamatory the extracts concerned read as followsi in fact the incident described in an article called mafia and the press published in gundam khabar happened not in one of the districts of baku but in sheki the one who was gravely insulted was not some ordinary man but bakhtiyar vahabzade a famous azerbaijani poet yes the exhead of executive authority in sheki ashraf mammadov was given an order by ramiz mehdiyev not to allow bakhtiyar vahabzade being elected and that was a part of a very serious plan in that manner mehdiyev wanted to gain revenge on bakhtiyar vahabzade who hated him for many yearsii ashraf mammadovs black days began after he had refused to obey ramiz mehdiyevs order no one would forget the wellknown events that had happened in sheki during the parliamentary elections yes indeed all of that was a scheme and both the sheki community and ashraf mammadov had to be punished because ramiz mehdiyev failed to implement his big plan the plan to crush bakhtiyar vahabzade in sheki that is why revenge had to be takeniii it is rumoured that the late president heydar aliyev did not allow the central election commission to annul bakhtiyar vahabzades deputy mandate and thus proved to mehdiyev who had the last word as it is also rumoured that mehdiyev had taken on such initiativeiv bakhtiyar vahabzade became an enemy of ramiz mehdiyev and the latter played the key role in the machine importing harmful ideas to azerbaijan and it is now clear that the only reason why bakhtiyar vahabzade was targeted was that he was a turkic nationalist mehdiyev not only insulted bakhtiyar vahabzade but also plotted conspiracy theories against him but none of that succeeded so now mehdiyev is taking revenge on bakhtiyar vahabzade by not perpetuating his name after the latters death according to information submitted by the government the events cited in one of the abovementioned statements see paragraph ii above refer to a riot which had broken out against am in sheki in on july the narimanov district court allowed rms civil action finding the title of the article and the extracts from it defamatory the firstinstance court noted in particular that the title and the extracts from the article suggested that rm hated bv and that rm had therefore tried without success to prevent his being elected as a member of parliament in had organised the events of in sheki in order to punish am for disobeying had tried to have bvs mandate as an mp called off and had prevented memorialising bv after the latters death furthermore the court noted that those allegations were statements affecting rms reputation and lacking any factual basis that the first applicant had failed to submit any evidence proving those allegations against rm and that the article in question constituted an abuse of the right to freedom of expression the firstinstance court ordered the first applicant to issue an apology and refutation the first applicant was also ordered to pay azn which at the material time was equivalent to approximately euros eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage to be transferred to an orphanage as requested by the plaintiff the first applicant appealed arguing that by publishing the article in question it had performed its role of public watchdog reporting on topics of high public interest that rm who was a wellknown highranking government official should have displayed a greater degree of tolerance of criticism against him that the statements made in the article constituted value judgments and therefore were not susceptible of proof and that the article merely reproduced and commented on information which had been published earlier in gundam khabar gündəm xəbər newspaper in may in an article entitled mafia and the press mafiya və mətbuat the relevant part of the abovementioned article published in gundam khabar had stated the following once an exhead of the executive authority of one of the biggest districts in baku told what had happened to him he said that there had been a writer who had lived in that district for many years and had run as a candidate for the parliamentary elections sometime before the elections ramiz mehdiyev called and ordered me to ensure that another person indicated by him was elected i was forced to obey ramiz mehdiyevs order on september the baku court of appeal upheld the judgment of the firstinstance court reiterating the same grounds to which the firstinstance court had referred see paragraph above the first applicant lodged a cassation appeal reiterating its earlier complaints on february the supreme court dismissed the appeal as unfounded and upheld the lower courts judgments reiterating the same grounds to which the lower courts had referred further developments according to the government the applicants did not publish an apology or refutation or pay the nonpecuniary damages as ordered by the domestic courts according to the applicants on october property belonging to the first applicant such as computers printers heating devices and telephones was seized under a decision qərardad given by the narimanov district court on the same day to ensure the payment of the award for nonpecuniary damage in question inter alia according to the applicants after the abovementioned seizure of its belongings khural ceased publication however it appears that its internet version wwwxuralcom has remained active it is not clear whether the newspaper resumed publication in paper version at a later stage according to an article published on the internet version of khural on december publishing houses had refused to publish khural and therefore the first applicants staff decided to publish a new newspaper called asi asi̇ it is not clear whether the plan to publish a new newspaper ever came to fruition relevant legal framework the relevant parts of

4,the applicant was born in and lives in warsaw a press publications and the press conference at the relevant time the applicant was a member of the polish parliament in october a series of reports appeared in the polish press in which the applicants past was described it was reported that the applicant had sexually abused students when working as a teacher in the s the reports in question were published in the polish daily newspapers super express on october and rzeczpospolita and gazeta wyborcza on october on the internet portal wydarzeniapl on october and by the information radio agency on october and the polish press agency on and october on october the applicant organised a press conference which was held in the sejm building the conference was transmitted by a tv news information channel tvn at the press conference the applicant said of course this was connected with the blackmail to which we were subjected we already know which journalists cooperated and with whom in order to obtain money from us under false pretences today this is almost one hundred per cent clear to us i think that today those three gentlemen already know about that those journalists cooperated with the informer who supplied the information on the basis of which the whole matter was disseminated and today as far as we know they are being paid for that i do not yet know how much some or of the amount obtained following this statement a journalist from the daily super express jh commented i am the author of this article jh from super express my question concerns the people who inspired me maybe you could tell us something else about these familialfinancial relationships the applicant replied i will reply to you the first complaint will be lodged against you with the court tomorrow after that three more complaints will be lodged on october the rzeczpospolita daily published an article entitled jan bestry i did not commit rape i will sue super express according to this article the super express daily had written that in the s the applicants employment contract had been terminated without notice because he had sexually abused young girls the article went on to say that a few days after publication of this story the tv station tvn reported that the applicant had been convicted in of having assaulted a woman passenger on a train when working as a train conductor the article also mentioned that during an interview with rzeczpospolita the applicant had said the disclosure of these matters is in effect a plot in which super express was involved the author of the article was gp who wrote it after interviewing the applicant on the phone according to gp the applicant approved publication of the contents of the article and the statements cited in the article were the statements made by the applicant however the applicant denied having spoken to gp or having approved any information for publication in the press article when questioned by the court he said that he had not attempted to have a correction of this article published because he had only found out about it in the course of the judicial proceedings see paragraph below b civil proceedings against the applicant on december the former editorinchief of the super express daily tl and the publisher of the newspaper the company media express sp z oo lodged a civil claim against the applicant for the protection of their personal rights they claimed that the applicant had harmed their good name and credibility by statements he had made at the press conference on october and in the article published by rzeczpospolita on october on may the warsaw regional court granted the claim in part and ordered the applicant to publish an apology for the statements he had made and which were cited in the article published by rzeczpospolita on october using the following wording jan bestry apologises to tl the former editorinchief of the super express daily for unlawful infringement of his personal rights namely his good name and professional credibility by alleging in the rzeczpospolita daily in an article published in issue no dated october november under the headline jan bestry i did not commit rape i will sue super express that the disclosure of the matters referred to in the article is in effect a plot in which super express was involved the applicant was also ordered to make a similar statement of apology as regards the plaintiff company media express sp z oo and to publish these two statements in a particular way on page four of rzeczpospolita the court refused to grant the plaintiffs request that the apology also be published in five other dailies and on the tvn channel finding that such an order would exceed the severity of the infringement committed by the applicant the court justified its reasoning by finding that the applicants statement referring to a plot in which the super express daily was involved infringed the plaintiffs personal rights and at the same time the applicant had not in any way proved the veracity of his allegations both at the time the article was published and later in the course of the civil proceedings he had failed to demonstrate that the newspaper had in fact been involved in any plot the court concluded that the applicants statements which had been made in public amounted to unverified suspicions and accusations addressed to the newspaper it further observed that the applicant as member of the parliament had a right to criticise socially negative phenomena guaranteed to him by the polish constitution and by article of the european convention on human rights however while enjoying this right he may not overstep the limits of permissible criticism by spreading groundless accusations the court did not find credible the applicants submission at the hearing on may that he had only found out about the rzeczpospolita article in the course of the proceedings the court took the view that having held a press conference the applicant would surely have followed the press articles which appeared over the following days concerning the subject matter discussed at the conference the court dismissed the remainder of the claim finding that the statements made by the applicant at the press conference on october could not unambiguously be interpreted as concerning journalists from a specific newspaper because the applicant had not expressly mentioned any journalist or newspaper by name both parties appealed against the firstinstance judgment on february the warsaw court of appeal amended the challenged judgment insofar as it additionally ordered the applicant to publish an apology for the statements made during the press conference on october the court examined what was said in the course of the conference and found that the applicant had initially referred to the events of s and to his work at the school and in the railway company he had also said everything which was written in super express is untrue next the

5,in and lives in berlin the applicant was represented by mr c partsch a lawyer practising in berlin the government were represented by represented by two of their agents mr hj behrens and ms k behr of the federal ministry of justice and consumer protection the facts of the case may be summarised as follows administrative proceedings by letter of january the applicant requested the foreign intelligence service to allow him to get physical access and to consult in person the files akteneinsicht as well as to make copies of the documents it held regarding several prominent persons among whom mr ub a former prime minister of the land of schleswig holstein who had died during the night of to october in the beau rivage hotel in geneva switzerland the applicant specified that he was interested in particular in the services findings and investigations regarding the circumstances of ubs death and rumours that ub had collaborated with the intelligence service of an eastern european country and that he had been blackmailed by such service he relied on section subsection in conjunction with section subsection of the act on the use and preservation of federal archival documents gesetz über die nutzung und sicherung von archivgut des bundes bundesarchivgesetz hereinafter federal archives act see paragraph below on article of the basic law and on caselaw of the federal administrative court the applicant did not explain why he needed physical access to the said files on december the foreign intelligence service denied the applicants request the requirements under the federal archives act were not met the documents did not date from more than thirty years ago and filing the documents with the federal archives for the purposes of shortening the period during which the information was classified was not possible as the service still needed the files concerned on march the foreign intelligence service rejected the applicants administrative appeal widerspruch insofar as it concerned the consultation of the files in person the appeal was illfounded insofar as he sought to rely on section subsection in conjunction with section subsection of the federal archives act the files were held by the foreign intelligence service not by the federal archives and only files older than thirty years that were held by the service could be consulted in accordance with these provisions this requirement was not met as the files at issue relating to ub dated from to the provisions concerning a shortening of the period of closure schutzfrist concerned files that were held by the federal archives themselves as well as files which continued to be subject to closure even after the expiry of the thirtyyear period the appeal was inadmissible insofar as the applicant sought to rely on article of the basic law in order to be allowed to consult the files in person given that no refusal decision on this request which could form the subject of the appeal had been taken yet in this connection the service considered in the applicants favour that the development in the caselaw of the federal administrative court which had found by a leading judgment of february for the first time there to be a right of the press to receive information to be derived directly from article second sentence of the basic law verfassungsunmittelbarer auskunftsanspruch see paragraph below was to be taken into account however that right was limited to receiving information auskunftserteilung and did not encompass a right to consult files in person at the same time the foreign intelligence stated that the applicants request to receive information under article of the basic law was still being processed within the foreign intelligence service it being noted that the federal administrative courts judgment of february had been delivered only very recently and that it was not yet available to the service in writing the service stated that it would separately inform the applicant about its decision on his request to receive information proceedings before the federal administrative court on april the applicant lodged an action with the federal administrative court claiming that he was entitled to consult the files in person the applicant submitted that the thirtyyear period of closure provided for by the federal archives act aimed at striking a balance between the freedom of information and privacy in the light of the comprehensive publications on the death of ub a prominent politician and continuing suspicions that he was murdered and that this murder was covered up by the german authorities considerations relating to ubs privacy were clearly outweighed by the interests of the press and the public in the information concerning the circumstances of his death taking into account the role of the press as a public watchdog and the paramount public interest in the information the thirtyyear period of closure was to be shortened in the present case the applicant added that he was also entitled to consult the files in person on the basis of article first sentence of the basic law article second sentence of the basic law and article of the basic law see paragraph below he emphasised that the right of the press to receive information may take the form of a right to consult files in person the respondent acknowledged inter alia that the right of the press to receive information from federal agencies which derived directly from article second sentence of the basic law may exceptionally consolidate sich verdichten to become a right to consult files in person however the applicant had not made a substantiated submission in this respect neither in the administrative proceedings nor before the federal administrative court and no grounds could be discerned for concluding that this exception applied in the present case in particular there were no grounds for concluding that the obligation to give access to the information in a complete and truthful manner could only be achieved by way of allowing the applicant to consult the files in person in his reply the applicant submitted in respect of the right of the press to receive information under article second sentence of the basic law that in view of the voluminous scope of the files at issue access to the information in a complete and appropriate manner could only be ensured by allowing him to consult the files in person by judgment of november the federal administrative court rejected the applicants action it found that the applicant could not rely on the federal archives act he could not rely on its section subsection directly because the said files were not archived within the meaning of that provision as they continued to be with the foreign intelligence service not the federal archives section subsection taken in conjunction with section subsection of the federal archives act only applied to files thirty years or older which was not the case here the foreign intelligence service had credibly substantiated that its files on ub were less old and the applicant had not disputed this as the wording of section subsection of the federal archives act was unequivocal and not open to any interpretation it was not possible to shorten that period and subsection in particular did not apply to the thirtyyear period stipulated by subsection the federal administrative court went on to find that the applicant did not have a right to consult in person the files at issue under article first sentence of the basic law the right to information informationsfreiheit guaranteed by that provision did not apply as the files at issue were not publicly available sources allgemein zugängliche quellen this right did not entail having information held by the authorities made publicly available the federal administrative court held that the applicant did not have a right to consult in person the files under article second sentence of the basic law either referring to its leading judgment of february in other proceedings see paragraphs above and below the court reiterated that a right of the press to receive information derived from article second sentence of the basic law directly this right reflected a minimum standard which the legislature which had a wide margin of appreciation and the exclusive prerogative to adopt rules that may accord more weight to one or other of the competing interests must not fall short of it met its limit where the press interest in receiving information was opposed by legitimate interests of individuals or authorities the scope of that right did in general encompass neither consulting in person files held by authorities nor making copies of such files umfasst grundsätzlich nicht eine aktennutzung durch einsichtnahme in behördenakten oder eine kopie von behördenakten lastly the federal administrative court found that the applicant did not have a right to consult the files in person under article of the basic law no right of the applicant to have his research work supported by being allowed to consult files in person could be derived from that provision the judgment was served on the applicants counsel on january disclosure of information outside the scope of the proceedings outside the scope of the proceedings at issue the applicant on september four months after he had lodged his action with the federal administrative court see paragraph above relying on the right of the press to receive information presserechtlicher auskunftsanspruch under article second sentence

the foreign intelligence service regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of ub the letter stated that the service had never been charged with investigating the circumstances of the death of ub it had received certain indications from different sources and transmitted these without delay to the competent investigative authorities some pages of the files held by the service had been identified so far as having at least a vague connection to the circumstances of ubs death the vast majority of the documents concerned a review of press articles inquiries made towards the service correspondence with the competent investigative authority and speaking notes for parliament the letter listed twelve indications received by the foreign intelligence service from november onwards all but one of these indications had been transmitted to the competent public prosecutors office the person who had given the one indication which was not transmitted had been contacted by the prosecution authorities several times already at the applicants subsequent request the foreign intelligence service on february provided the applicant with information regarding the dates of transmission of the said indications to the competent public prosecutors office the proceedings before the federal constitutional court on february the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint the applicant argued that the federal administrative court had not sufficiently taken his fundamental rights guaranteed by article first and second sentence and article of the basic law into account when interpreting the provisions of the federal archives act see paragraphs and above he further referred to this courts caselaw on the right of access to information under article of the convention emphasising the role of the press as a public watchdog the applicant moreover alleged that the federal administrative court had breached his right to be heard by ignoring his submission that it was not credible that the foreign intelligence services documents relating to ub dated from onwards given that ub had died in the applicant did not raise further arguments before the federal constitutional court nor did he mention in his constitutional complaint that information on the scope and content of the files held by the foreign intelligence service on ub had been disclosed to him in the meantime see paragraph above on september the federal constitutional court declined to consider the applicants constitutional complaint for adjudication without providing reasons no bv r the decision was served on the applicants counsel on september the applicants subsequent publications on february the applicant published an article in bild in which he reproduced some of the information disclosed to him by the foreign intelligence services letters of december and february on july the applicant published another article in bild stating that the foreign intelligence service held pages of files on ub which

of allowing them to consult the files idem in its leading judgment of february no a the federal administrative court found that land press legislation was not applicable to the foreign intelligence

6,the applicant was born in and lives in weinheim he is a campaigner against abortion and operates an antiabortion website on and april the applicant distributed leaflets in the vicinity of the medical practice of dr st who performed abortions there the leaflets stated inter alia that the abortions performed by dr st in his practice for which he gave the address were unlawful according to the caselaw of the federal constitutional court in addition the leaflet contained the following statements according to international criminal law aggravated murder is the intentional bringingtodeath of an innocent human being sinngemӓβ aus den internationalen strafgesetzen mord ist das vorsӓtzliche zu tode bringen eines unschuldigen menschen the murder of human beings in auschwitz was unlawful but the morally degraded ns state allowed the murder of innocent people and did not make it subject to criminal liability die ermordung der menschen in auschwitz war rechtswidrig aber der moralisch verkommene nsstaat hatte den mord an den unschuldigen menschen erlaubt und nicht unter strafe gestellt the applicant also addressed passersby and the physicians presumed patients and attempted to engage with them in conversations about abortion dr st lodged an application for a civil injunction against the applicant and on october the mannheim regional court granted the requested injunction the court ordered the applicant to desist from speaking to passersby in the immediate vicinity of the medical practice and labelling the abortions performed by the plaintiff unlawful with the objective of irritating female patients and preventing them from visiting dr sts practice on february the karlsruhe court of appeal upheld the decision and slightly modified the wording specifying the geographical area concerned by the injunction it also refused to grant leave to appeal on points of law the regional court as well as the court of appeal both referred to a previous decision of the federal court of justice in which it had confirmed a civil injunction against similar conduct by the applicant see paragraph below the courts held that in the case at issue there were no factual or legal differences justifying deviating from the caselaw of the federal court of justice in so far that the doctor in the present case was slightly more wellknown than the doctor in the original case the court of appeal held that this was of minor relevance the fact that dr st had appeared as an expert before the german parliament many years previously did not have any substantial effects on dr sts public profile at that time moreover the involvement of dr st in different legal disputes was irrelevant as trying to enforce his rights in the appropriate legal procedure could not redound to dr sts disadvantage in sum the applicant had vilified the noncriminal professional activities of dr st by implying that he committed criminal acts and interfered with the relationship of trust between doctor and patient which deserved special protection against the interventions of others the applicant had therefore severely interfered with dr sts personality rights this interference was not justified by the applicants freedom of expression in view of the massive pillory effect the applicant had created by singling out the plaintiff and criticising him in a harsh way in the immediate vicinity of his practice on may the federal court of justice refused a request by the applicant for legal aid on the grounds that the applicants intended appeal on points of law lacked sufficient prospect of success on july the federal constitutional court refused to admit the applicants complaint for adjudication for being inadmissible without providing reasons no bv r ii relevant domestic law and practice the relevant provisions of the german basic law grundgesetz criminal code strafgesetzbuch and civil code bürgerliches gesetzbuch have been set out in the courts judgment in annen no no september in addition on december the federal court of justice confirmed an injunction ordering the applicant to desist from addressing patients and passersby in a specified area in front of a medical practice and from pointing out that in the practice abortions were performed no vi zr it pointed out that the doctors activities were legal and enjoyed protection under his constitutional right to freedom to exercise his profession the court emphasised the important role which the legislature had attributed to gynaecologists both in the protection of unborn life and in the protection of the health of the women concerned it was essential that the relationship of trust between the doctor and his patients was not disturbed by the intrusion of external parties the applicants actions had adversely affected the plaintiffs activities in an unacceptable way and had singled him out without any reason therefore the court concluded that under the circumstances of this particular case the physicians personality rights prevailed over the applicants freedom of expression a constitutional complaint against the judgment of the federal court of justice was not admitted for adjudication

7,in and lives in zagreb he was represented by mrs v drenški lasan a lawyer practising in zagreb the government were represented by their agent mrs š stažnik the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows on june the applicant a retired politician who had previously held high political functions in the country lodged a request with the croatian state archive hrvatski državni arhiv hereinafter the state archive to be granted access to fiftysix documents that formed part of the archival collection of the office of the president of the republic of croatia for the period between and the applicant stated that he needed those records in order to write a documentary history of the founding of the croatian state given that the documents in question were classified as state secret strictly confidential for a period of thirty years the state archive requested the office of the president of the republic of croatia as the owner of those documents to decide on whether or not they should be declassified prior to taking a decision the office of the president requested the opinion of the office of the national security council ured vijeća za nacionalnu sigurnost hereinafter the national security council the national security council examined the applicants request and the contents of the requested records and concluded that owing to the nature of the contents of certain records the need to safeguard the values for which those documents had been declared secret in the first place namely the independence integrity and national security of the republic of croatia and its foreign relations still prevailed the disclosure of the said documents would in the opinion of the office of the national security council cause harm to the values protected under section of the data secrecy act see paragraph below subsequently on august the office of the president declassified thirtyone of the requested documents but declined to declassify the remaining twentyfive documents the documents that remained secret were transcripts from certain sessions held in and by the defence and national security council of which the applicant had been a member an advisory body to the president of the republic which at the material time had examined strategic issues of state policy and national security and had coordinated the activities of the highest state bodies and institutions certain records of meetings between the then president of croatia and senior foreign officials and croatian officials were also left classified by the office of the president in the reasoning for its decision not to declassify the latter documents the office of the president held as follows having taken into account the request submitted by the applicant as well as the contents of specific records the office of the national security council was of the opinion that owing to the contents of certain records transcripts the need to protect the values in defence of which those records had originally been classified independence the integrity and security of the republic of croatia and the foreign relations of the republic of croatia still prevailed therefore those individual records transcripts should not be declassified accordingly the office of the national security council deemed that the documents listed in this decision contained information the disclosure of which might potentially jeopardise the values listed in section of the data secrecy act in view of the above and given that under section of the data secrecy act the opinion of the office of the national security council is not binding but the owner of the information has the exclusive authority to ultimately decide whether the classification of certain data is to remain or be changed or if that data is to be declassified it has been established that declassifying some of the requested documents might cause irreparable harm to the values listed in section of the data secrecy act and that the protection of those values prevails over the interest of the public which is why the degree of classification of the documents listed in this decision is maintained following the decision of the office of the president on september the state archive refused the applicants request for the declassification of the abovementioned twentyfive records which remained top secret and granted his request to be allowed early access to archival material from that collection with respect to the thirtyone records that had been declassified by the presidents decision on september the applicant lodged an appeal with the information commissioner alleging inter alia that the contested ruling had been arbitrary unfair and devoid of any clear criteria because he had been granted access to transcripts of certain meetings but not to other conversations between the same persons on july the information commissioner dismissed the applicants appeal for the purpose of the appeal proceedings she directly inspected the documents in question and ultimately accepted the conclusion that their declassification may harm national security and foreign relations noting in addition that the applicant had failed to provide arguments in his appeal as to why those documents should have been declassified or why his interest in accessing the information outweighed the public interest in protecting the aims at stake the information commissioner also stated that under the relevant domestic law and practice only the owner of the documents in issue in this case the office of the president of the republic had the power to alter the classification level of confidential information and that the procedure followed by that body had been lawful on september the applicant brought an action for judicial review in the high administrative court of the republic of croatia visoki upravni sud republike hrvatske seeking to have quashed the information commissioners ruling which in his view did not contain any reasoning in respect of why certain records had been declassified while others had not in her reply the information commissioner stressed that only the owner of the documents in question had the power to declassify them on october the high administrative court dismissed the applicants action it found that the applicant had not contested the facts but only the application of the law that the information commissioner had acted lawfully when she had dismissed his appeal and that she had provided clear and valid reasoning for her decision it held that in the case at hand the owner of the information and the body with the power to classify but also to declassify it is the president of the republic when there is a public interest in the disclosure of such information its owner is under an obligation to assess the proportionality between the right of access to information and the protection of the values listed in sections and of the data secrecy act and to decide whether to maintain the degree of classification amend it or declassify the information at issue however before reaching its decision the owner of the information must request the opinion of the office of the national security council in line with section of the data secrecy act it can be seen from the case file that following the applicants request the prescribed procedure was followed given that the firstinstance public authority requested the declassification of the documents in question by the owner of the information which after obtaining the opinion of the office of the national security council decided not to declassify them that being so the state archive was not authorised to provide the requested information on appeal the information commissioner inspected the opinion of the office of the national security council which stated that owing to the contents of certain documents transcripts the need to protect the values in defence of which those records had originally been classified the independence integrity and security of the republic of croatia and its foreign relations still prevailed and gave the opinion that declassifying certain documents could cause damage to the values listed in section of the data secrecy act given that under section of the data secrecy act the owner of classified information has the exclusive power to decide whether to maintain alter the level of the classification or declassify the information in question in the opinion of this court the state archive respected the prescribed procedure and in accordance with the opinion of the office of the national security council and the decision of the owner of the information lawfully rejected the request of the applicant for access to the information in question and the information commissioner on appeal correctly established that in the present case the protection of the values listed in section of the data secrecy act prevailed over the public interest in the publishing of the protected information and that the decision of the owner of the information had been rendered following a lawful procedure therefore in view of the cited legal provisions on which the information commissioners decision is based as well as the facts established in the proceedings this court finds that the information commissioner correctly dismissed the applicants appeal against the state archives decision and that it provided clear and valid reasons for that decision which is entirely upheld by this court the objection of the applicant that the refusal of his request was not sufficiently reasoned is therefore illfounded and his objection relating to voluntarism voluntarizam in disclosing the requested information is not proven and in light of the lawful procedure in the present case and the discretionary powers of the owner of the information as regards declassification of classified information has no bearing on a different outcome of the present case on december the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court ustavni sud republike hrvatske complaining inter alia of a breach of his right to a fair trial and of his right of access to information on march the constitutional court sitting as a bench of twelve judges dismissed the applicants constitutional complaint having concluded that there had been an interference with the applicants right of access to information because his academic work had been a matter of public interest and that the interference had been lawful the constitutional court held as follows as regards the legitimate aim the constitutional court points out that the impugned judgment in addition to relying on section of the data secrecy act and section of the access to information act stated that the opinion of the office of the national security council had been obtained the constitutional court considers that a more detailed specification of the legitimate reasons for the denial of access to the information sought in the specific circumstances of the present case namely upholding the interests of the state in the areas of independence integrity national security and the international relations of the republic of croatia would constitute a problem amounting to the disclosure of that protected information to the extent that the legitimate reasons for denying access to the information sought have been specified in the present case see subsection of section above the constitutional court considers that the said interference was necessary in a free and democratic society and proportionate to the nature of the need the constitutional court has already explained its previously stated opinion mutatis mutandis in its decision no uiii three judges of the constitutional court dissented in the dissenting opinion of two of them judges lk and gs stated as follows firstly the applicants right to effective legal protection has been limited in the course of the administrative proceedings by the president of the republic of croatia as the firstinstance administrative authority as well as by the information commissioner and the administrative courts in the case at hand the violation of the constitutional right to effective legal protection is twofold on the one hand the violation occurred because the refusal to grant access to the documents in question by the president was not sufficiently reasoned on the other hand the applicants right was violated because the information commissioner and the administrative courts failed to fulfil their supervisory function and refused to examine the substantive content justification for the assessment of the need to deny access a precisely defined goal the manner in which the protected aim was jeopardised the scope of any possible damage the risk of such damage occurring but instead limited their assessment to a mere review of the formal reasons given the citing of legal provisions a review of the relevant deadlines and on the inclusion of advisory bodies secondly we consider that there has been a violation of the applicants constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression the applicant sought access to a certain number of presidential records with a view to conducting research and analysis for a book covering political events that occurred during the period of croatian history that the records in question concern the denial of access to those records can not be contested if there indeed is a reason on the basis of which it could be concluded that their publication would cause irreparable harm to the national security integrity and independence of the republic of croatia however the applicant and the public do not know whether their publication would indeed have such an effect because they have been prevented from knowing whether an assessment has been conducted at all and if so whether it was sufficiently serious and rigorous the applicant is supposed to trust the state authorities without having had a chance to question their assessment or to provide counterarguments this has effectively defied the point of the constitutional right to freedom of expression as one of the constitutional forms of protection from arbitrary abuse of the power afforded to the authorities without being given any real opportunity to question the substance of the assessment of the existence of any risk of irreparable harm to the interests of the republic of croatia the applicant has been denied his right to effective legal protection of his constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression therefore in the present case the violation of the constitutional guarantee of effective legal protection in administrative proceedings at the same time constitutes a breach of the constitutional freedom of expression in its procedural aspect the president of the republic certainly has the authority to deny access to presidential records however that authority is not absolute it is subject to an assessment of the risk of irreparable harm being done to the national interests of the republic of croatia the president adopted the decision in the present case in the form of an administrative decision which therefore has to be reasoned the sufficiency of that reasoning is to be assessed in each individual case on the basis of the specific circumstances of the case the president is not obliged to state the reasons which may jeopardise the aim of classifying the documents in question but merely stating that the president has the authority to deny access in order to protect secrecy she requested the opinion of the council she received the opinion whereby the national security council expresses its view that it is necessary to maintain the existing secrecy classification and she agreed with that opinion with the aim of protecting the interests of the national security integrity and independence of the republic of croatia and its international reputation does not satisfy the requirement of sufficiency first of all such reasoning does not indicate that a proportionality test was indeed conducted citizens are requested to simply assume that the president of the republic conducted a proportionality test as required by the data secrecy act although on the basis of such reasoning it is possible to doubt whether the decision has been adopted as a result of somebodys subjective impression that the requested documents should not become public just to be on the safe side we do not question that in cases such as the present one it is quite possible for the authority from which access to classified information is being requested will not have at its disposal many facts which it might otherwise be able to refer to in its reasoning as evidence that its decision to refuse a request for declassification is justified without jeopardising the purpose of the classification by the publication thereof however such reasoning can not boil down to stating general aims which the denial of access is supposed to protect such as the independence integrity or safety of the republic of croatia or of its international relations reasoning that does not indicate more specifically the reasons for arguing that the publication of the requested information might jeopardise what are in essence the highest interests of the republic of croatia does not support the assumption that a proportionality test has actually been conducted a proportionality test requires the public authority to examine the adequacy of the impugned measure and its necessity it is not possible to achieve either of those if the goal of the measure in question is set hypothetically and in the abstract this is particularly applicable under the circumstances of the present case indeed despite exerting ones best attempts it is not easy to understand the reasons that would justify the assumption that the publication of conversations that took place almost a quarter of a century ago between two statesmen who died many years ago about a historical period and events concerning which in the interim much has been discovered could jeopardise the integrity of the republic of croatia today moreover were these hypothetical and abstract reasons to constitute sufficient reason to deny access to records concerning events of such a nature then they would be sufficient to justify any act of public authority that limits the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens the applicants attorney received the constitutional courts decision on april on february in an interview given to a daily newspaper the applicant stated that he had finished writing his book and that it would be published in a few months he also stated that should the strasbourg court

8,the applicant was born in and lives in sant angelo in campo lucca a the applicants circular letter in the applicant was practising law in september he sent a letter to the italian national legal service commission consiglio superiore della magistratura the csm in which he complained about the conduct of a judge x at the lucca district court he subsequently transmitted the content of that letter by means of a circular letter to a number of judges of the same court but without expressly referring to x by name the relevant parts of that circular letter read as follows before you receive any incorrect or untrue information before the corporatist spirit prevails over a correct interpretation of the reasons that drove me to write to the csm to the ministry of justice to the national council of notaries and to the national bar council about the conduct of two judges of the lucca district court in the context of a judicial partition procedure to which my clients were parties and before any of my colleagues come to apologise on my behalf for my initiative perhaps making out that i am insane or irresponsible my intention is to clarify and tell you the reasons which led me to do so an appeal on points of law is pending against a judgment of the lucca district court in which that court ruling against the claims by a female partner and deciding on the related issue of the partition of an inheritance asked the investigating judge to proceed with the sale of a flat which was the sole item of property to be divided between the heirs and which was occupied by the partner and her daughter an heir born to the cohabiting couple since the judgment of the lucca district court was not final it was not possible to proceed with the sale or to initiate the procedure relating thereto since this was prohibited expressly by article of the code of civil procedure the other heir however applied for the sale and the investigating judge in spite of our repeated requests for suspension of the sale which were all rejected brought about after two auctions without a buyer the conveyance of the property to a third party at the third auction here are the specific reasons for which all our requests were rejected in spite of this i would like to point out at the outset that i do not feel any animosity towards the judiciary and judges in general and that i consider by contrast that the role played by judges is crucial and irreplaceable for civil society there are and have been judges who carry out and have carried out their duties with great dignity and decorum decoro and who deserve my admiration and the admiration of all those who have worked in the field of justice none of us can forget y who died one can say on the battlefield i still remember that in the courtroom he was the one out of all his colleagues who even in his state of extreme and obvious suffering took the greatest number cases for adjudication and he carried on doing this until the bitter end i confess that if i had been able to spare him the effort in view of his condition i would willingly have taken over his workload but there are other equally deserving judges who work even during their holidays going to the office talking to lawyers and with whom we can have a form of collaboration and dialogue and to them i also express my esteem and admiration i am well aware that justice is done by men and precisely for that reason decisions may be erroneous and incomplete i still prefer however a human justice to one that is automated but what i refuse to accept is the idea that when the rights of the individual and the dignity of those whose task it is to defend him or her are at stake those rights could be decided upon in a partial manner perhaps with a display of arrogance or that a ruling could be given with total indifference and lack of commitment i personally believe strongly in the autonomy of the judiciary and i feel that without respect for the autonomy of the person whose task it is to decide it would be impossible to have dispassionate and fair judgments autonomy however can not be turned into an absolute discretionary power because that would be bordering on or tantamount to arbitrariness i have pointed out how i see the meaning of justice and reiterate that i think very highly of the duties exercised by judges and that my full admiration goes to those who act with dedication commitment and decorum decoro i am even envious of judges because they probably have more time to study and to dwell on issues and also to attend to other cultural and social interests than lawyers who by the nature and specificity of their work do not always manage to do things or to do things well i often take home things to read and to study and i end up midevening nodding off over a book after a busy day running from one office to another in the morning and answering the phone or receiving clients in the afternoon i also understand that the judiciary is burdened with work and with problems that the staffing is insufficient and the workload huge and for that reason it is true that protests esposti do not help to get the work done more easily and that more collaboration and dialogue would be better than protests there are limits however that in my view should not be passed and after thinking about this for quite some time i decided to submit this particular protest the letter to the csm i will now quote the last part of my protest in which i dwell on the meaning of the lawyers profession and ask whether it is legitimate that any decision or conduct should always be accepted this lawyer would point out as follows it is regrettable to direct this letter against individuals who even if they have different duties are considered by this lawyer to be colleagues as practitioners in law usually call each other he considers however that he is obliged to do so in response to a lack of commitment and total indifference towards the legitimate demands of the citizen in whose name justice is done with a belief in impunity as the position is one of power even though it should be seen as the discharge of a duty and last but not least a lack of respect for the dignity and responsibility of this lawyers profession this lawyer has practised law in courts at three levels of jurisdiction has borne very high costs on behalf of his clients to the point where if one were to apply the professional rate one would exceed the amount of the claim has sought in three statements of claim filed in the florence court of appeal a stay of execution under article of the code of civil procedure but his requests were all rejected by reasoning that leaves much to be desired but that is not the subject of this protest has accumulated a formidable pile of documents of all descriptions and has seen the attachment of funds in respect of his own claim go up in smoke in the time it has taken to work on these cases he could probably have dealt with fifteen ordinary cases of average complexity if work any type of work provided it is lawful has its own protection and its own dignity then the judge too more than any person as a result of his function and role can not but allow himself not to respect for the work of others including that of the lawyer as a legal practitioner this lawyer has a duty to provide some certainty to his client who is the citizen in whose name justice is done judgments are headed in the name of the italian people what certainty can the lawyer provide if each judge instead of applying the law gives his preferred interpretation and does not even explain his interpretation of the laws in question it should be noted that the system of appeals and claims is no guarantee for the citizen judges are only human and can make mistakes errare humanum est but they can not and must not wilfully make mistakes by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence and the citizen must have his or her claims upheld provided they are well founded from the earliest stage there are a large number of cases this can be explained by the fact that if many decisions had been taken correctly from the outset one could have avoided the proliferation of cases procedures and claims as can be seen here and not forgetting the many cases where the citizen disappointed and bemused to receive abnormal decisions having lost all confidence in the justice system decides not to appeal this entails a justified loss of confidence in the courts and an increase in workload and expense for the state because of the extra work for other judges registries and bailiffs and what justification and explanation could be given by the lawyer to this client to whom he had predicted a certain result with all due caution only to present a decision by the judge that is diametrically opposed to that which he predicted if that is the result of an error or a lack of knowledge or commitment or analysis on the part of the lawyer he should take responsibility for it but when this depends on the judge it is damaging to the lawyer because the client will necessarily have a negative opinion of the lawyers work are clients and citizens capable of understanding whether it is the lawyer or the judge who has made a mistake and to what extent if the lawyer does not obtain appropriate results with legal argument what other means are available what must the lawyer do to obtain something to which he is professionally entitled or should the lawyer not make life difficult for himself and carry on regardless tending to his garden il suo orticello while protecting his head from any tiles that might fall off the roof because on the one hand he is not protected and on the other he is at the mercy of another persons discretionary power without any regard for his own professional dignity when this letter reaches you i will be undergoing a medical operation i am sorry that for the time being i can not provide any further clarification or explanations to those who may wish them i am however ready if necessary to answer for my conduct and to provide any clarification that may be requested of me after my operation when i am in a better state of health again b firstinstance proceedings finding that certain expressions used in the circular letter had impugned his reputation x filed a criminal complaint for defamation against the applicant as x was a judge in lucca the file was transferred under article of the code of criminal procedure to the judicial authorities of genoa on february the genoa public prosecutor requested that the applicant be committed to stand trial before the court of that city x joined the criminal proceedings against the applicant as a civil party according to the charge in the circular letter the applicant had expressed admissible lecite criticism in so far as he spoke about interpreting and performing the work of a judge but had then overstepped the limits to his freedom of expression by writing the following sentences in particulara autonomy can not be turned into an absolute discretionary power because that would be bordering on or tantamount to arbitrarinessb in a partial manner perhaps with a display of arrogance or a ruling given with total indifference and lack of commitmentc the judge can not allow himself not to respect the work of others including that of the lawyerd judges are only human and can make mistakes but they can not and must not wilfully make mistakes by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence at the hearing of march the representative of the public prosecutors office stated that the applicant also had to be charged with proffering insults given that it transpired from xs statement that he had been one of the recipients of the circular letter in a judgment of february deposited in the courts registry on february the genoa district court convicted the applicant of defamation and proffering insults and sentenced him to four months imprisonment and to the reimbursement of xs court costs amounting to euros eur with reparation for the damage sustained by x the amount of that damage was to be fixed in separate civil proceedings the court nevertheless awarded x an advance payment provisionale of eur the district court observed that it was not in dispute that the applicant had written the circular letter and had asked his secretary to send copies to the judges in the civil divisions of the lucca district court during the proceedings the applicant had filed pleadings and had made spontaneous statements his arguments in defence had not however made it possible to disregard the offensive nature of the expressions used in the circular letter exacerbated by the fact that he was a lawyer in his letter the applicant had stated that he had the greatest respect for the judiciary and for judges who carried out their duties with dedication commitment and decorum but he was clearly not talking here about x who had been accused by the applicant of being arrogant and indifferent of believing that he was immune because he held a position of power and of having committed wilful mistakes by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence those accusations could be explained not by xs inaction in the handling of a case but by the decisions taken by x in a case where the applicants requests had been rejected instead of reiterating his legal arguments the applicant had overstepped the limits of his right to criticism alleging that x had erred wilfully thus seriously impugning the honour of the judge in question according to the district court the subject of the accusations contained in the circular letter could only have been x as shown by similar letters which expressly referred to that judge addressed by the applicant and his clients to the csm the ministry of justice the national council of notaries and the national bar council the applicants defence esimente of provocation article of the criminal code was not accepted even supposing that the decisions of x could be regarded as unfair acts the circular letter sent about four months after those decisions did not constitute an immediate reaction to them c court of appeal proceedings the applicant lodged an appeal he alleged among other things that the offences he was said to have committed were punishable merely by a fine that the sentence imposed on him had been disproportionate and that the advance he had to pay was excessive moreover in his complaint x had not mentioned that he himself had been a recipient of the circular letter thus ruling out the charge of proffering insults the applicant also argued that it could not be seen from the text of the letter that the criticism was directed at x and that this document when assessed as a whole was merely a manifestation of his frustrations about the shortcomings of the justice system in general lastly in the alternative he took the view that his defence of provocation was valid he argued that in the proceedings for the partition of an inheritance x had on a number of occasions rejected his requests for the suspension of a sale by auction of the flat in question and that xs decisions had subsequently been overturned by another judge at the hearing of march the applicant stated that it had not been his intention to offend x personally and he produced documents as evidence of his illhealth in a judgment of the same day deposited in the courts registry on april the genoa court of appeal ruled that no prosecution could be brought on a charge of proffering insults as there had been no criminal complaint on that ground and reduced the sentence for the offence of defamation to a fine of eur it stated that this sentence was fully remitted condonata and ordered the applicant to make reparation for the damage sustained by x which it assessed at eur and to reimburse xs court costs in the appeal proceedings eur the court of appeal observed that in the first part of his circular letter the applicant had recounted the tribulations of the partition proceedings in which x had taken the impugned decisions he had added that he regretted having to make complaints about certain individuals x and another judge whom even though they had different duties from his own he regarded as colleagues in addition the judges of the lucca district court giving testimony in the firstinstance proceedings had had no difficulty in identifying x as the addressee of the criticisms in the circular letter in those circumstances the applicants argument that the letter was merely a manifestation of his discontent about the justice system in general could not be accepted in the court of appeals view the decisions taken by x in the context of the inheritance partition proceedings could at most be regarded as erroneous but not as unfair the court also pointed out that one of the questions at the heart of the dispute the existence of inheritance rights in favour of the partner had been settled by the court of cassation differently from the applicants proposed solution the national bar council had in fact noted that the applicants letters could have been seen as a means of pressure against the judges concerned according to the court of appeal the applicant had not expressly challenged the part of the firstinstance judgment considering that the expressions contained in the circular letter had overstepped the limits of the right to criticise the applicant who had no criminal record had to be allowed the benefit of mitigating circumstances and under article of legislative decree no of see paragraph below the penalty for defamation was now a mere fine and not a custodial sentence the court of appeal observed that the distribution of a letter such as that sent by the applicant within a small court could not but impugn the dignity of the judge against whom it was directed and his image as an independent judge the expressions used by the applicant outside any procedural act sought to call into question the professional conduct of x who was portrayed within a restricted community as a partial and soft judge in the light of those considerations the court of appeal ruling on an equitable basis awarded the civil party eur in nonpecuniary damage d appeal on points of law the applicant appealed on points of law he reiterated his grievances and referring to a particular passage in his grounds of appeal stated that the court of appeal had made a mistake in asserting that the defendant had failed to challenge the finding about the offensive nature of the expressions contained in the circular letter in any event the judge had been required at all stages of the proceedings to verify of his own motion whether or not the criminal charge in question was made out in a judgment of november deposited in the courts registry on december the court of cassation finding that the court of appeal had given logical and correct reasoning in respect of all the contentious points dismissed the applicants appeal on points of law ii relevant domestic law article of the criminal code provides for the offence of defamation the relevant parts of that article read as follows anyone who in communication with more than one person offends against the reputation of another shall be punished by one years imprisonment or by a fine of up to eur defamation which consists in imputing a particular fact shall be punished by up to two years imprisonment or by a fine of up to eur defamation which is

9,the applicant companies have their seat in kokemäki the first applicant company satakunnan markkinapörssi oy has been publishing veropörssi magazine since the magazine publishes yearly information about natural persons taxable income and assets this information is public according to finnish law several other publications and media companies also publish such information the editorinchief of the magazine lodged an application with the court in see anttila v finland dec no november in the magazine appeared times and each issue concentrated on a certain geographical area of the country data on million persons taxable income and assets was published which constituted at the time a third of all taxable persons in finland the magazine also published taxrelated articles and announcements the first applicant company satakunnan markkinapörssi oy has worked in cooperation with the second applicant company satamedia oy the companies are owned by the same persons in the second applicant company together with a telephone operator started an smsservice by sending a persons name to a service number taxation information concerning that person could be obtained if information was available in the database the database was created using data already published in the magazine since the second applicant company has also been publishing veropörssi magazine on an unspecified date the data protection ombudsman tietosuojavaltuutettu dataombudsmannen contacted the applicant companies and advised them to stop publishing taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in collecting data which was not to be published was not forbidden the companies declined because they felt that this request violated their freedom of expression by letter dated april the data protection ombudsman requested the data protection board tietosuojalautakunta datasekretessnämnden to order that the applicant companies be forbidden to process taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in and to pass such data to an smsservice he claimed that under the personal data act the companies had no right to establish such personal data registers and that the derogation provided by the act concerning journalism did not apply to the present case the collecting of taxation information and the passing of such information to third parties was not journalism but processing of personal data which the applicant companies had had no right to do on january the data protection board dismissed the request of the data protection ombudsman it found that the derogation provided by the personal data act concerning journalism applied to the present case as concerned the smsservice the data used in the service had already been published in veropörssi magazine and the act did not therefore apply to it by letter dated february the data protection ombudsman appealed to the helsinki administrative court hallintooikeus förvaltningsdomstolen reiterating his request that the applicant companies be forbidden to process taxation information in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in and to pass such data to the smsservice on september the administrative court rejected the appeal it found that the derogation provided by the personal data act concerning journalism which had its origins in directive ec should not be interpreted too strictly as it would then favour protection of privacy over freedom of expression the court considered that veropörssi magazine had a journalistic purpose and that it was also in the public interest to publish such data the court emphasised in particular that the published data was public the derogation provided by the personal data act concerning journalism thus applied to the present case as concerned the smsservice the court agreed with the data protection board that as the information had already been published in the magazine the act did not apply to it by letter dated october the data protection ombudsman appealed further to the supreme administrative court korkein hallintooikeus högsta förvaltningsdomstolen reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the administrative court on february the supreme administrative court decided to request a preliminary ruling from the court of justice of the european union on the interpretation of directive ec on december the court of justice of the european union sitting in a grand chamber composition gave its judgment see case c tietosuojavaltuutettu v satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy judgment of december grand chamber it found first of all that the activities in question constituted processing of personal data to which the directive applied moreover activities involving the processing of personal data such as that relating to personal data files which contained solely and in unaltered form material that had already been published in the media also fell within the scope of the directive in order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society it was necessary to interpret notions relating to that freedom such as journalism broadly however in order to achieve a balance between the two fundamental rights the protection of the fundamental right to privacy required that the derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of data provided for in the directive had to apply only in so far as was strictly necessary in conclusion activities such as those involved in the domestic proceedings relating to data from documents which were in the public domain under national legislation could be classified as journalistic activities if their object was to disclose to the public information opinions or ideas irrespective of the medium which was used to transmit them they were not limited to media undertakings and could be undertaken for profitmaking purposes on september the supreme administrative court quashed the previous decisions and referred the case back to the data protection board it requested the board to forbid the processing of taxation data in the manner and to the extent carried out in the court noted first that the term journalism was not defined in directive ec but that according to the court of justice of the european union it was necessary to interpret notions relating to freedom of expression such as journalism broadly however when balanced against the right to privacy any derogations to the latter were to be kept only to what was strictly necessary when balancing the right to freedom of expression against the right to privacy the court had found that the decisive factor was to assess whether a publication contributed to a public debate or was solely intended to satisfy the curiosity of readers the supreme administrative court found that the publication of the whole database collected for journalistic purposes could not be regarded as journalistic activity the public interest did not require such publication of personal data to the extent seen in the present case in particular as the derogation in the personal data act was to be interpreted strictly the same applied also to the smsservice the smsservice was shut down after the decision of the supreme administrative court was served on the applicant companies the magazine continued publishing taxation data in autumn when its content was only one fifth of the previous content since then the magazine has not appeared on november the data protection board forbade the first applicant company to process taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in and to forward this information to an smsservice the second applicant company was forbidden to collect save or forward to an smsservice any information received from the first applicant companys registers and published in veropörssi magazine by letter dated december after the data protection board had made its decision the data protection ombudsman asked the applicant companies to indicate what measure they were envisaging to take in view of the boards decision in their reply the applicant companies asked the data protection ombudsmans view on the conditions under which they could continue publishing public taxation data at least to a certain extent in his reply the data protection ombudsman stated that according to the supreme administrative courts decision the applicant companies lacked the legal right to maintain their taxation database and to publish it and reminded them of his duty to report any breach of the personal data act to the police by letter dated february the applicant companies appealed against the decision of the data protection board to the helsinki administrative court which transferred the case to the turku administrative court they complained that the decision violated the prohibition of censorship guaranteed by the constitution as well as their freedom of expression the finnish constitution provided better protection than the international human rights treaties as the latter did not prohibit censorship fully according to the domestic law it was not possible to prevent publication of information on the basis of the amount of information to be published or of the means used for its publication nor was it possible to use public interest as a criterion for preventing publication when preventive restriction of freedom of expression was concerned accepting that would mean that the authorities would be able to prevent publication if they thought that the publication did not promote discussion of a topic of public interest on october the turku administrative court rejected the applicant companies appeal it found that as far as the matter had been decided by the supreme administrative court in its decision of september it could not take a stand on the issue in the latter decision the supreme administrative court had stated that the case was not about the public nature of the taxation documents nor about the right to publish such information as the court was now examining only the decision rendered by the data protection board which was issued as a result of the supreme administrative courts decision of september it could not examine the issues which the supreme administrative court had excluded from the scope of its decision as the boards decision corresponded to the content of the supreme administrative courts decision there was no reason to change it by letter dated november the applicant companies appealed further to the supreme administrative court reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the administrative court they noted in particular that the decision issued by the data protection board had prohibited the processing of taxation information for publishing purposes as well as requiring that the internal registers of the first applicant company be protected in a manner required by the personal data act in practice the companies were prevented from collecting information for publishing purposes which meant that there was an interdiction to publish such information the companies noted that the finnish constitution also prohibited indirect preventive censorship on june the supreme administrative court upheld the judgment of the administrative court it found that the case was not about the right to publish taxation information as such nor about preventive censorship on these grounds and the grounds mentioned in the administrative courts reasoning the court found that there

10,in and lives in kragujevac at the relevant time he was an editorinchief of svetlost a weekly news magazine based in the same city the applicant was represented by ms d rakićević a lawyer practising in kragujevac the government were represented by their agent ms z jadrijević mladar the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows the published article on august svetlost published an article entitled the citys chief undertaker ccu mr a from a smuggler to a rich man glavni gradski grobar gggr g a od švercera do bogatuna the subtitle just below states that before you decide to die ask ccu as to whether you can do so since in kragujevac only the privileged have this right pre nego što odlučite da umrete pitajte gggr da li možete to da uradite jer u kragujevcu to pravo imaju samo privilegovani the article itself written by ms b a journalist employed with svetlost in so far as referred to by the domestic courts reads as follows in connection with an earlier case allegedly involving the building of a family crypt in the centre of the kragujevac cemetery by a local businessman referred to as pharaoh a case which greatly agitated the citizens of kragujevac because of the digging up of multiple existing graves ccu stated that all this was lawful and marketbased enforcing discipline against the dead and calling out the living for their debts ccu just like any other debt enforcer started issuing threats of a most bizarre nature which this journalist can not now convey for the sake of decency if we were a state based on the rule of law and a civil society this man would have to be removed from his position immediately for not being up to it both as a person and professionally instead walking bravely in his gianfranco ferré shoes he is successfully leading the citys public burial company although ccus career seems fantastic it was not easy to travel for such a short time the road from being a transitional loser and a cigarette smuggler to being a person wearing gianfranco ferré shoes and living the high life at a time when thousands of experts and hard workers were losing their jobs ccu went in another direction and from an ordinary worker three years of vocational school and a street cigarette smuggler became a director of the citys cemetery about whose high income both official and more often unofficial under the counter there are fantastical stories being told throughout the city through the constant increase in the price of death and personal human tragedy ccu is building his successful career at the time when the case referred to in paragraph of this article happened ccu left one political party and joined another one whose boss ordered him to sell to the kragujevac pharaoh the centre of the old city cemetery leaving nothing to chance ccu managed to secure for himself two diplomas just in case they were needed they may come in handy and it sounds better when introducing oneself as part of the above article there was also a photograph of mr a referred to by his name and surname and an explanation that it was taken on the occasion of a public presentation of a book about graveyards promocija monografije o grobljima the civil proceedings in august mr a lodged a civil defamation claim against the applicant ms b and svetlost regarding the published article and the said photograph on september the kragujevac high court viši sud u kragujevcu ruled partly in favour of mr a and ordered the applicant ms b and svetlost to pay him jointly i serbian dinars rsd equivalent to approximately

violation of his right to privacy and iii rsd in litigation costs equivalent to approximately eur at the time all with statutory interest as of the date of adjudication the kragujevac high court

statement which the court accepted mr a had never worn italian shoes and had properly obtained his diplomas he had however used to sell cigarettes for a while the respondents had furthermore failed to verify the other allegations against mr a thus harming his honour and his reputation in particular the court could not accept that the allegations regarding the functioning of the public burial company had been based on a press conference which had taken place in or on statements which had been given by a number of its former employees as suggested by the respondents since there was no evidence in support of those claims in fact the witnesses including the mayor personally who had been heard in the course of the proceedings all explicitly stated otherwise following the publication of the article mr a had been contacted by many friends colleagues and business partners as well as by the mayor they had all wanted to know whether the allegations contained in the article were

violation of his privacy in connection with the photograph which had been published as part of the article and amended the amount which had been awarded for litigation costs to rsd equivalent to approximately eur at the time in its reasoning which was otherwise essentially along the lines of the reasons which had been offered at first instance the kragujevac appeals court pointed out inter alia that mr a was not entitled to any compensation for the alleged violation of his privacy since he had been a public function holder and the photograph in question had been taken during a public event related to the performance of his duties mr as consent had therefore not been necessary for its publication the above rulings relied on inter alia some of the relevant provisions of the

11,the first applicant had its registered office in kirov the second applicant was born in and lives in kirov the first applicant was a limited liability company founded by the state property department of the kirov regional government and registered as a legal entity in on an unspecified date the kirov regional legislative assembly and the kirov regional government founded the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper on august it was officially registered as a regional news medium the official address of its editorial board was the same as that of the first applicant according to the applicants the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper was not registered as a legal entity and did not have articles of association the first applicant was the publisher of the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper the applicants were however unable to submit a publishing agreement according to its articles of association as amended on may the first applicants main activity consisted in issuing the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper it also carried out publishing and advertising activities the first applicant was managed by its executive body the editorinchief that position was occupied at the material time by the second applicant who was at the same time the editorinchief of the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper a the article on august the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper published an article under the headline the chief federal inspector has brought the media to its knees but not the businessmen гфи поставил на колени прессу но не коммерсантов the article was written by the second applicant who signed it using his penname semyon volkov the article concerned a joint press conference held by mr p the chief federal inspector for the kirov region and mr k the mayor of kirov the press conference was about the media coverage of the regional project kirov cultural capital of the volga region for the article was critical of the cultural value of the events connected with the project and spoke ironically about mr ps accomplishments in that field mr p was further quoted as saying that the allotted funds were insufficient to finance the work of the projects organising committee and as criticising local businesses for their unwillingness to sponsor the project allegedly because the project had not received the governors explicit endorsement the article then went on as follows curiously enough just before that meeting i had a chance to talk to some businessmen i know they told me that the chief federal inspectors office had literally pestered them with offers for them to become sponsors however they do not respond to such offers not because they fear the governor but because they do not want to give money some say that mr p is too deeply involved in political games of which they want no part others are for some reason concerned that their money might be wasted on the lovers of the collector of funds rather than spent on cultural events b defamation proceedings on august mr p in his official capacity as the chief federal inspector brought an action for defamation against the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper and the author of the article semyon volkov according to his statement of claim the final paragraph of the contested article had asserted that he was in charge of the collection and distribution of funds for the project that he was capable of committing a crime by embezzling the funds entrusted to him and that he had lovers thereby violating moral and ethical norms considering that those statements were untrue and damaging to his honour dignity and professional reputation he sought a retraction and compensation for nonpecuniary damage mr p also enclosed the text of the retraction statement that he wished the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper to publish it contained an apology and an acknowledgement that the last sentence of the paragraph cited above was untrue and damaging to his honour and reputation a promise to discipline the author of the article and an undertaking to respect the domestic law on the media in the future on september mr g deputy editorinchief of the first applicant signed a power of attorney appointing mr k and mr r to act as its counsel in the defamation proceedings on september judge s of the leninskiy district court of kirov decided to sever the claim against the author of the article for adjudication in separate proceedings because the first applicant had refused to disclose his identity the proceedings against the author were stayed proceedings in respect of the first applicant on september the leninskiy district court of kirov sitting in a singlejudge formation comprising judge s held a hearing counsel mr k and mr r asked that the hearing be adjourned because the second applicant the newspapers editorinchief and the only person acquainted with the circumstances relating to the contested publication was on annual leave until october the court refused the request mr k and mr r further submitted that the contested statements did not concern mr p who was not the collector of funds for the cultural project the funds were being collected by the kirov town administration counsel for mr p submitted that the article had been entirely devoted to mr p it stated in particular that he had pestered local businessmen with requests to become sponsors of the cultural project the last sentence of the article which concerned the collector of funds could easily be interpreted as directed at mr p such an interpretation had indeed been made by a number of local newspapers which had also understood the last sentence of the article as referring to mr p on september the leninskiy district court of kirov granted mr ps claim against the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper in full the court found that the final paragraph of the article contained false information about the plaintiff who it had falsely alleged was the collector of funds that might have been wasted on lovers rather than spent on cultural events the court noted that the defendant had not produced any proof of the truthfulness of that information it ordered the editorial board to pay the plaintiff russian roubles rur approximately euros eur in compensation for nonpecuniary damage and rur in court fees it further ordered an immediate publication of the retraction statement as drafted by mr p on september enforcement proceedings were opened on the same day the first applicant applied to the leninskiy district court for a stay in the enforcement proceedings it submitted that the court had ordered the enforcement of the judgment against the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper which had no legal entity status and accordingly could not be a defendant in civil proceedings furthermore the order for immediate enforcement was unlawful and violated the first applicants right to know the reasons for the judgment at that time the full text of the judgment was unavailable and to lodge an appeal against it on september judge s issued two interim decisions by the first decision he refused the first applicants request for a stay of enforcement as unsubstantiated no further reasons were given the second decision rectified an error in the operative part of the judgment it held that the defendants name was the limited liability company the editorial board of the vesti newspaper rather than the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper on september the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper published the retraction statement as drafted by mr p and endorsed in the judgment of september on september the first applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment of september submitting that the article had not named the collector of funds for the project or suggested that it was mr p who had collected the funds nor had it stated that mr p had lovers or that he had embezzled any funds entrusted to him it was clear from the text that the contested sentence did not concern mr p at all the first applicant further complained about the district courts unreasoned refusal to adjourn the hearing until the second applicant had returned from leave the second applicant was the only person who knew the identity of the author of the article and who was able to give an informed response to the statement of claim the second applicant lodged a statement in support of the appeal he disclosed that he was the author of the article and stated that the judgment of september had been poorly reasoned although mr p had failed to prove that the contested sentence concerned him personally the district court had accepted his claim without analysing whether the impugned statements were indeed directed at him proceedings in respect of the second applicant on an unspecified date the proceedings against the author of the article were resumed and the second applicant was summoned to appear before the leninskiy district court as the defendant in mr ps defamation case instituted on august his case was heard by a bench composed of the presiding judge s and two lay assessors the second applicant lodged an objection against judge s on the ground that he had already expressed his position in the judgment against the editorial board lay assessors examined and rejected the objection finding that the second applicants fears as to mr ss impartiality were not justified at the hearing on october the second applicant was represented by mr r as counsel the second applicant and his counsel both argued that the last sentence of the article did not concern mr p it concerned the collector of funds who had not been identified in the article the fact that other newspapers had interpreted the last sentence as directed at mr p was irrelevant because the second applicant could not be held responsible for the actions of other people they further submitted that the second applicant had simply repeated the reservations expressed by businessmen with regard to the distribution of the funds collected for the project counsel for mr p repeated the arguments he had advanced at the hearing of september in particular the reasons why mr p believed that the contested statements were directed at him he submitted in particular that the title and the structure of the article showed that it was entirely about mr p and that other people had understood the last sentence of the article as concerning mr p and this had been proved by articles in other newspapers on october the leninskiy district court issued a judgment against the second applicant the court found that the article read as a whole gave the impression that the contested statements concerned mr p the same interpretation had been arrived at by other newspapers which had been unanimous in considering that the last sentence had been about mr p the contested statements which accused mr p of spending public funds on lovers were damaging to his honour dignity and professional reputation the second applicant had failed to prove the truthfulness of his statements about mr p the second applicant was ordered to pay rur approximately euros in compensation for nonpecuniary damage and rur in court fees the second applicant appealed he repeated the arguments advanced in his statement in support of the first applicants appeal he further argued that the outcome of his case had been predetermined by the judgment against the editorial board judge s who had examined the case against the editorial board was bound to have had a preconceived opinion on his case appeal proceedings in respect of the applicants on october the kirov regional court adjourned the examination of the appeals it established that the interim decision of september rectifying an error in the judgment of september had been issued in the absence of the interested parties moreover the parties had not received a copy of that decision and had thereby been deprived of an opportunity to appeal until that omission had been remedied the appeal against the judgment of september could not be examined nor could the appeal against the judgment of october because both cases were based on the same claim the determination of one of them would prejudge the outcome of the other on that ground the kirov regional court decided that the two cases should be joined and all appeals should be examined simultaneously on november the first applicant lodged an appeal against the interim decision of september it argued that that decision was unlawful for the following reasons the rectification had been made by the district court of its own motion the decision had been taken in the absence of the parties and in substance the decision was the disguised substitution of a defendant rather than a correction of a clerical error or an obvious mistake the first applicant submitted that the limited liability company the editorial board of the vesti newspaper and the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper were two distinct entities the first was registered as a legal entity while the second was operating without state registration the fact that the district court had issued a judgment against the wrong entity demonstrated that the adjudication of the case had been superficial and the essential aspects of the case had not been examined properly on november the leninskiy district court by a new interim decision confirmed its earlier decision of september on the rectification of the error regarding the defendants name the first applicant lodged an appeal repeating the arguments advanced in the appeal statement of november on december the kirov regional court examined all the appeals both applicants were represented at the hearing by mr r the kirov regional court quashed the interim decision of september on the ground that it had been issued in the absence of the parties but upheld the interim decision of november which in its view was lawful thus it found that counsel who had taken part in the hearing of september had represented the interests of the first applicant the limited liability company the editorial board of the vesti newspaper it was clear that the judgment of september defined the rights of and imposed obligations on the first applicant because no other organisation had been involved in the proceedings the amendment of the defendants name had therefore been no more than a rectification of a clerical error not related to the merits of the case and having no effect on the substance of the judgment the regional court further upheld the judgments of september and october in substance in particular it found that the district court had addressed the applicants arguments relating to the existence of an objective link between the contested statements and the plaintiff it had analysed the tile structure and contents of the impugned article and had correctly found that its last sentence concerned mr p moreover it had taken into account that mr p was not the only one to have understood that the sentence had been directed at him other newspapers had also drawn the same conclusion the district court had therefore correctly required the defendants to prove the truthfulness of their allegations which they had failed to do both applicants had been represented at hearings by counsel and their procedural rights had therefore been respected finally the regional court held that the severance of the claim against the second applicant from the proceedings had not involved a substantially incorrect determination of the dispute the regional court found however that the district court had incorrectly required the first applicant to publish the retraction statement drafted by the plaintiff the requirement for an apology a promise to discipline the author and an undertaking to respect domestic law contained in the retraction statement had no basis in domestic law the order for immediate enforcement had also been unlawful the court ordered that the first applicant publish an amended retraction statement it also reduced the award payable by the first applicant to rur approximately euros on january the first applicant published the amended retraction statement on august the first applicant was declared insolvent and dissolved ii relevant domestic lawa civil actions for defamation article of the civil code provides that an individual may apply to a court with a request for the retraction of statements svedeniya that are damaging to his

nonpecuniary damage sustained as a result of the dissemination of such statements ruling no of the plenary supreme court of the russian federation adopted on august as amended on april and in force at the material time provided that in order to be considered damaging statements had to be untrue and contain allegations of a breach of laws or moral principles for example the commission of a dishonest act or improper behaviour in the workplace or in everyday life dissemination of statements was understood as the publication of statements or their broadcasting paragraph the burden of proof was on the defendant to show that the disseminated statements were true and accurate paragraph on february the plenary supreme court of the russian federation adopted ruling no requiring courts hearing defamation claims to distinguish between statements of facts which could be checked for veracity and evaluative judgments opinions and convictions which were not actionable under article of the civil

review boards objection only the website credits had been deleted the applicant had provided mh with a cd containing all the data required for the running of the austrian website the version of the german website which could be reached via the link on the austrian website included the following statement equating the babycaust to the holocaust would mean relativising todays abortion murders den babycaust mit dem holocaust gleichzusetzen würde bedeuten die heutigen abtreibungsmorde zu relativieren moreover on the home page of the austrian website the following statement was shown between two photos of babies one of which was obviously covered in blood there is no other word for it abortion is aggravated murder abtreibung ist mord es gibt kein anderes wortthe photo underneath showed a pile of corpses in an unspecified third reich concentration camp the caption below read abortion and euthanasia are crimes that no human law can presume to declare lawful abtreibung und euthanasie sind verbrechen die für rechtmäßig zu erklären sich menschliches gesetz anmaßen kann furthermore under a link abortions on the austrian website a caricaturelike drawing of a wolf as an executioner guillotining embryos was shown the text above this image read abortionists they can kill but woe betide those who remind them of the killing abtreiber töten können sie aber wehe wenn man sie ans töten erinnert underneath the text read fascists anti fascists whether concentrationcamp commanders or murderers of unborn children both are manifestations of criminals these low lifes have the same genetic makeup faschisten antifaschisten kzkommandanten oder mörder von ungeborenen sind zwei erscheinungsformen von kriminellen menschen diese sumpfblüten haben denselben genetischen code accessible via the link not for the fainthearted were images purporting to show aborted foetuses and the words sixty years post auschwitz after termination its off to the incinerator or the rubbish heap jahre nach auschwitz nach der unterbrechung gehts in den verbrennungsofen oder auf den müll following the link germany and a further link on that page to prayer requests reference was made to a decision by the karlsruhe court of appeal judgment of february u prohibiting the applicant from labelling abortions as performed by the doctors named on his website as aggravated murder the reference was glossed with the following statement we have not labelled and do not label abortion doctors as aggravated murderers however we will stand firm in our conviction that the wilful bringingtodeath of an innocent human being is aggravated murder can anyone seriously argue that an innocent unborn human being is not wilfully killed in an abortion abtreibungsärzte sind von uns nicht als mörder bezeichnet worden und werden von uns nicht als mörder bezeichnet aber wir werden zu unserer meinung stehen das vorsätzliche zu tode bringen eines unschuldigen menschen ist mord und wer kann ernstlich behaupten dass bei einer abtreibung kein unschuldiger ungeborener mensch vorsätzlich getötet wird at the very bottom of the same page under the highlighted text german contemporary history in brief a sentence read perverted doctors murdered unborn children at the behest of their mothers pervertierte ärzte ermordeten im auftrag der mütter die ungeborenen kinder from that page the reader was directed to a locationbased alphabetical list mentioning the names and practice addresses of many doctors across germany who performed abortions the list was accompanied by an invitation to pray for these doctors dr f the plaintiff in the main proceedings was mentioned on the list he was of jewish faith and his family had suffered from the atrocities carried out during the national socialist era b domestic proceedings dr f applied to the courts for an injunction against the applicant and mh as well as for damages for the violation of his personality rights he argued that the websites in question had generated a direct association between the named doctors and the third reich equated abortions with the crimes of the third reich and stigmatised him as a murderer on february the karlsruhe regional court ordered the applicant to desist from using andor allowing the use of the term aggravated murder on the german website or the austrian website to describe abortions performed by dr f who was named on those websites it also ordered the applicant as joint and several debtor gesamtschuldner with mh to pay dr f compensation of euros eur a similar order against mh was issued in a separate judgment the karlsruhe regional court gave the following grounds for its decision firstly it established that the statements at issue could be attributed to the applicant the fact that the said content was accessible only via the indirect route of the austrian website operated by mh was irrelevant the applicant had made the content his own by having referred and created a link on the german website expressly to mhs website he had also not disputed during the proceedings that the statements had originated from him moreover throughout the proceedings he had continuously and with conviction described abortion as aggravated murder and considered the comparison of abortions and the holocaust reflected even in the babycaust domain name to be appropriate in a next step the court analysed screenshots of the website which had been submitted by the plaintiff it concluded that the website at issue contained the general statement that abortions as performed by dr f were acts of aggravated murder comparable with the utterly unjustifiable atrocities inflicted on jews in the third reich by mentioning dr fs name and his practice address directly in this context the applicant had reproached the doctor specifically for performing abortions and had created a pillory effect even though the applicant had made his statements in the context of a public debate of fundamental importance and freedom of expression protected polemical and sharp criticism the applicants comments on the german website and the austrian website had not been posted as broad criticism but specifically against the doctors mentioned on those sites the applicant had purposefully undermined the plaintiffs right of personality by labelling abortion as aggravated murder equating it to the crimes of the holocaust and reproaching dr f specifically for his involvement this was also true on the assumption that the statements constituted an expression of opinion and not a factual claim consequently the weighing of all those considerations turned out in favour of dr fs general right of personality which in these circumstances prevailed over the applicants freedom of expression as regards damages the karlsruhe regional court reasoned that the violation of the right of personality and the associated stigmatising effect were particularly serious given that dr f himself was jewish and his family had suffered directly the nazi atrocities in the third reich moreover the court took into account that the applicant had persistently made these or similar statements and had not been dissuaded by orders to desist issued against him such as the decision of the karlsruhe court of appeal of february u to which the website referred see paragraph above or the inclusion of the website on the list of publications harmful to minors by the federal review board by indicative order of september the karlsruhe court of appeal notified the applicant of its intention to dismiss his appeal owing to insufficient prospects of success the court elaborated that the regional courts conclusion that the austrian website had levelled the serious and personal allegation against dr f that he had performed acts of aggravated murder the allegation had further involved comparing abortions to the extermination of jews under nazi rule this had constituted a serious attack on dr fs reputation and personality rights the court of appeal also confirmed that the applicant had to assume responsibility for the content of the austrian website he had given the relevant content from his own website over to mh and had given his consent by means of a link for it to be posted on the austrian website moreover the award of monetary compensation was appropriate in the light of the severity of the interference with the general right of personality the regional court had correctly taken into account to the detriment of the applicant that he had failed to observe the legally binding decision of the karlsruhe court of appeal of february the court further clarified that for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation to be awarded it was irrelevant whether dr f was jewish and that his family had been persecuted under the nazi regime in support of that view the court adjudged that there were no apparent indications that the applicant had had or should have had any such knowledge the applicant was provided with the opportunity to submit his position on the above reasoning which he made use of to no avail on february the karlsruhe court of appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant without an oral hearing it referred to its reasoning in the indicative order of september and emphasised that the awarded damages had been justified irrespective of whether dr f was jewish on april the federal constitutional court refused to admit a complaint by the applicant for adjudication for being inadmissible bv r without providing reasons ii relevant domestic law and practice the relevant domestic

13,in and lives in genappe he was represented by mr a berenboom lawyer the belgian government the government were represented by their agent ms i niedlispacher of the federal justice department background to the case the applicant is the publisher of the newspaper le soir one of belgiums leading frenchlanguage newspapers in a print edition of the newspaper an article reported among other items on a car accident caused by g that had led to the death of two people and injured three others the article mentioned gs full name g was convicted in connection with the incident in he served his sentence and was formally rehabilitated in since june the newspapers website has provided an electronic version of its archives dating back to including the abovementioned article when the archives were published online and throughout the proceedings before the domestic courts the articles were freely accessible on the website on june july and august g wrote to the legal department of the public limited company rossel et compagnie which owned le soir requesting that the article be removed from the newspapers electronic archives or at least rendered anonymous in support of his request g referred to the fact that he was a doctor and that the article appeared on the list of search results when his name was typed into several search engines on january the legal department of rossel et compagnie refused to remove the impugned article from the archives but stated that it had given notice to the administrator of the search engine google to delist the article a reminder was sent to the administrator of google on february before the domestic courts the applicant stated that these steps had produced no response the court has not been informed of any subsequent followup action on march g brought the case before the council for journalistic ethics conseil de déontologie journalistique the cdj the selfregulatory body of the french and germanspeaking media in belgium on april the cdj declared the request inadmissible on the grounds that the dispute did not concern a matter of journalistic ethics it pointed to the solutions that had been adopted by belgian newspaper publishers with regard to electronic press archives namely the right to rectification in cases where the information was inaccurate and the right of electronic communication in cases where the information was incomplete domestic court proceedings in a summons served on may g instituted proceedings against the applicant in the neufchâteau court of first instance seeking to have the online press archive in question anonymised on the basis of article of the civil code in the alternative should the applicant actually provide irrefutable technical evidence of the impossibility of making the information anonymous g sought an order requiring him to add a noindex tag to the online version of the article to prevent it from appearing on the list of results when his name was typed into the search engine of the newspapers website in gs view by keeping the article online without anonymising it or adding a noindex tag despite receiving a reasonable and substantiated request to that effect the applicant had committed a fault and had infringed gs right to be forgotten in a judgment of january the court of first instance allowed most of gs claims noting that the applicant had not adduced any evidence of the impossibility of anonymising the article the court ordered him to replace gs first name and surname by the letter x in the digital version of the article featured on the newspapers website and on any other database for which he was responsible the applicant was ordered to pay one euro to g in respect of nonpecuniary damage and to pay gs costs the court rejected the requests for an anonymised version of the judgment to be sent to the parties and to possible third parties and for the judgment to be declared immediately enforceable in a judgment of september the liège court of appeal upheld the lower courts judgment in its entirety the court of appeal began by pointing out that each of the parties had fundamental rights that were not absolute and were of equal ranking as to the criterion of lawfulness required in order to derogate from the principle of freedom of expression the court of appeal noted that the right to be forgotten was considered an integral part of the right to respect for private life as enshrined in article of the convention article of the international covenant on civil and political rights and article of the constitution that was sufficient to satisfy the lawfulness test in order to derogate from the principle of freedom of expression the court dismissed the applicants argument that article of the civil code did not provide a clear and foreseeable legal basis the provision in question constituted the ordinary rules on liability and was applicable to news organisations which could not be unaware that they might be held liable if the exercise of press freedom caused damage resulting from an infringement of the rights of others as the court of first instance had observed articles et seq of the civil code as interpreted by the belgian legal literature and caselaw constituted legislation that was sufficiently accessible clear precise and foreseeable for the purposes of article of the convention the court of appeal added that alongside the traditional aspect of the right to be forgotten linked to the fresh disclosure by the press of a persons previous convictions there existed a second aspect linked to the erasure of the digital data and in particular the data available on the internet the dispute which concerned the digitisation of journalistic archives related to the latter aspect namely the right to be forgotten online what was sought therefore was the removal of information available on the internet this right to be forgotten online had recently been established by the court of justice of the european union the cjeu in its judgment in google spain and google c may see paragraphs below the cjeu had held that the requirement regarding fresh disclosure of the information could be inferred from the effect of the search tool which gave prominence to information that would not otherwise be visible online it was true that the cjeu judgment concerned a dispute between a private individual and the operator of a search engine nevertheless the principles established by that judgment could be transposed to the case at hand in so far as the publisher had also enabled the article in question to be given prominence via the search engine of the newspapers website which was accessible free of charge the effect had also been multiplied significantly by the development of the operating software used by googletype search engines the indexing of the article on search engines was only possible because it was present in the database of le soir in nonanonymised form and without any noindex tag the right to be forgotten online was not unlimited and had to be regulated in so far as it was liable to come into conflict with the freedom of expression of the press in order to assess whether a balance had been struck between the fundamental rights enshrined inter alia in articles and of the convention it was necessary to have regard to the criteria defined in the courts caselaw von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr and the caselaw of the cjeu google spain and google cited above thus in order for a right to be forgotten to be recognised the facts had to have been disclosed lawfully in the first place and had to be of a judicial nature there could be no current interest in their disclosure the facts could not be of historical interest a certain time had to have elapsed between the two disclosures and the person concerned could not be a public figure had to have an interest in being reintegrated into society and had to have discharged his or her debt the court of appeals task in the case before it was to ascertain whether in the light of these criteria the restriction on press freedom stemming from gs request pursued a legitimate aim and satisfied the proportionality test in conformity with article of the convention in the instant case the court of appeal found that it was not disputed that the original disclosure of the information in question had been lawful and that the facts reported on had been of a judicial nature the fresh disclosure of the facts had no value in terms of newsworthiness g did not hold any public office the mere fact that he was a doctor in no way justified his continued identification in the online article some twenty years after the events the court considered this to be illegitimate and disproportionate since it did not add anything to the value of the article and was liable to cause indefinite and serious harm to gs reputation by giving him a virtual criminal record despite the fact that he had not only served his sentence after a final conviction for the offence but had also been rehabilitated twenty years after the events the identity of a person who was not a public figure did not enhance the public interest of the article which merely contributed at a statistical level to a public debate on road safety in the court of appeals view removing gs first name and surname did not render the information devoid of interest since it would have no impact on the actual substance of the information conveyed which concerned a tragic road traffic accident caused in particular by the harmful effects of alcohol the applicants arguments concerning the duty of remembrance and the need to preserve a full and faithful record in the archives were irrelevant g had not requested that the impugned article be removed from the archives but simply that the electronic version be rendered anonymous the paper archives remained intact and the applicant was still able to ensure the integrity of the original digital version the events reported on in the article were clearly not of historical significance as the article related to a banal albeit tragic news story which was not alleged still less demonstrated to have been a source of particular public concern lastly a significant length of time sixteen years had elapsed between the initial publication of the article and the first request for anonymisation some twenty years had passed by the time of delivery of the judgment it followed from all these considerations that g satisfied the criteria for claiming a right to be forgotten and that keeping the article in question online without rendering it anonymous was liable to cause him disproportionate harm when weighed against the benefits of strict observance of the applicants right to freedom of expression the criteria of lawfulness legitimacy and proportionality arising out of article of the convention were satisfied in the court of appeals view the request for anonymisation had been apt to ensure a proper balance between the interests at stake that balance would not be achieved by the establishment of a right to digital rectification or communication as proposed by the applicant such procedures would not be appropriate as they would allow the stigmatising effect of the serious offences committed by g and of the sentence he had already served to persist indefinitely and would render the rehabilitation order given in his favour meaningless hence the most effective means of protecting gs privacy without interfering to a disproportionate extent with the applicants freedom of expression was to anonymise the article on the website of le soir by replacing gs first name and surname with the letter x in the court of appeals view by refusing to accede to the request to anonymise the article the applicant had not acted in the way that any prudent and diligent publisher would act in the same circumstances that refusal constituted a fault a simple search using gs first name and surname in the search engine on le soirs website or on google immediately brought up the article that was undoubtedly a source of damage to g at least of a nonpecuniary nature such a situation made knowledge of his previous conviction easily accessible to a wide audience and was thus liable to stigmatise him seriously damage his reputation and prevent him from reintegrating into society normally a causal link between the fault and the damage sustained had also been established acceding to gs request did not confer on each and every individual a subjective right to rewrite history nor did it make it possible to falsify history or impose an excessive burden of responsibility on the applicant the court of appeal was called upon to determine a specific dispute between two parties in the context of a oneoff civil action for damages based on article of the civil code while seeking to ensure that a balance was struck between two fundamental rights claimed by the parties the applicant further argued before the court of appeal that the way in which the database of le soir worked meant that it was not possible to alter archived articles and thus to replace gs name with the letter x the court of appeal noted that in support of his claims the applicant had submitted a report drawn up by the newspapers technical department however the court considered that the report in question which had been prepared after the applicant had been given notice to appear by technicians who were in a relationship of dependency with the applicant did not provide any guarantees of impartiality and had no probative value moreover the report did not state that it was actually impossible to implement the measure requested but simply referred to the risks and costs the only reference to impossibility concerned the physical impossibility of withdrawing the newspapers that had been sold the collections that had been distributed and the numerous copies of the content available in physical and digital format in the public domain something that had not been requested the applicant appealed on points of law in one of his grounds of appeal he alleged a violation of article of the convention in particular he argued in the first limb of the ground of appeal that the fault he had allegedly committed consisted in disregarding a subjective right namely the right to be forgotten although that right was not enshrined either in clear precise and accessible domestic legislation or in a higherranking international rule but was derived solely from the legal literature and caselaw hence in the applicants view the court of appeal judgment had breached the requirement that the interference be lawful in the second limb of the ground of appeal the applicant contended that the order for him to alter in the online archives the content of an article that had been published in the past and was available in the paper archives amounted to unjustified interference with his freedom of expression in breach of article of the convention in a judgment of april the court of cassation dismissed the appeal on points of law it found that the first limb of the ground of appeal arguing that the court of appeal had based the right to be forgotten online on the legal literature and caselaw failed on factual grounds the court of cassation held as follows it follows from the reasoning of the court of appeal judgment firstly that the judgment under challenge regards the right to be forgotten online as an intrinsic component of the right to respect for private life and indeed states so and views such interference with the right to freedom of expression as may be justified in order to protect that right as being based not on the legal literature and caselaw which the judgment does not recognise as having general regulatory scope but on article of the convention article of the international covenant on civil and political rights and article of the constitution and secondly that it refers to the judgment of the court of justice of the european union only to lend support to its view on the scope of that right to be forgotten as to the second limb the court of cassation held that the right to respect for private life which encompassed the right to be forgotten might justify interference with the right to freedom of expression the digital archiving of an old press article which at the time it was printed had lawfully reported on past events that were now covered by the right to be forgotten was not exempt from possible interference with the right to freedom of expression in order to protect the right to be forgotten such interference might consist in altering the archived text so as to prevent or make good a breach of the right to be forgotten the court of appeal had ruled lawfully that the online archiving of the article in question had amounted to a fresh disclosure of gs previous conviction that was liable to infringe his right to be forgotten the court of appeal had subsequently weighed up the rights of the parties and had provided legal justification for its ruling that the applicant by refusing to accede to the request for the article to be anonymised had committed a fault it had therefore lawfully ordered him to replace gs first name and surname with the letter x on the website of le soir accordingly the second limb of the ground of appeal had to be dismissed it appears that the article in question is still available on the newspapers website but is accessible only to subscribers it is accompanied by a notice referring to the relevant judicial decision relevant legal framework and practice domestic law and practiceprotection of the fundamental rights at stake and the right to be forgotten the belgian constitution guarantees freedom to manifest ones opinions on all matters article and freedom of the press article as well as the right to respect for private and family life article prior to the events giving rise

of the european parliament and of the council of october on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data was aimed at protecting

under article of the directive the member states could provide for exemptions or derogations from the provisions of a number of chapters for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression only if they were necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing freedom of expression in its judgment of may case c euc google spain sl and google inc hereafter google spain the court of justice of the european union the cjeu was called upon to define the extent of the rights and obligations arising out of directive ec with regard to internet search engines the case originated in a complaint lodged by a spanish national with the spanish data protection agency against a spanish daily newspaper and google the applicant had complained that when an internet user entered his name in googles search engine the list of results displayed links to two pages of the newspaper mentioning his name in connection with an auction following attachment proceedings he had requested the newspaper either to remove or alter those pages so that the personal data relating to him no longer appeared or to use certain tools made available by search engines in order to protect his data he had also requested google to remove or conceal the personal data relating to him so that they ceased to be included in the search results and in the links to the newspaper while the spanish agency had rejected the complaint against the newspaper it had upheld the complaint against google which brought an action before the spanish courts it was in the context of this judicial dispute that the case was referred to the cjeu for a preliminary ruling the cjeu held that the operations carried out by operators of search engines should be classified as data processing of which they were the controllers article b and d regardless of the fact that these data had already been published on the internet and had not been altered by the search engine it stated that in so far as the activity of a search engine could be distinguished from and was additional to that carried out by publishers of websites and also affected the fundamental rights of the person concerned the operator of the search engine had to ensure in particular that the guarantees laid down by the directive could have full effect moreover given the ease with which information published on a website could be replicated on other sites effective and complete protection of data users and particularly of their right to privacy could not be achieved if they had to obtain first or in parallel the erasure of the information relating to them from the publishers of websites the cjeu concluded that the operator of a search engine was obliged to remove links to web pages that were published by third parties and contained information relating to a person from the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of that persons name including in cases where the name or information had not been erased beforehand or simultaneously from those web pages and even as applicable when its publication on those pages was in itself lawful the cjeu added that even initially lawful processing of accurate data could in the course of time become incompatible with the directive where those data were no longer necessary in the light of the purposes for which they had been collected or processed that was so in particular where they appeared to be inadequate irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive in relation to those purposes and in the light of the time that had elapsed the cjeu concluded that if under articles and of the european unions charter of fundamental rights guaranteeing respectively the right to respect for private life and the right to the protection of personal data the persons concerned had a right to ensure that the information in question relating to them personally should no longer be linked to their name by a list of results and they were thus entitled to request that the information in question no longer be made available to the general public on account of its inclusion in such a list of results those rights overrode as a rule not only the economic interest of the operator of the search engine but also the interest of the general public in having access to that information through a search relating to the names of the persons concerned however according to the cjeu that would not be the case if it appeared for particular reasons such as the role played by the persons concerned in public life that the interference with their fundamental rights was justified by the preponderant interest of the general public in having on account of its inclusion in the list of results access to the information in question regarding the difference in treatment between the publisher of a web page and the operator of a search engine the cjeu found as follows furthermore the processing by the publisher of a web page consisting in the publication of information relating to an individual may in some circumstances be carried out solely for journalistic purposes and thus benefit by virtue of article of directive from derogations from the requirements laid down by the directive whereas that does not appear to be so in the case of the processing carried out by the operator of a search engine it can not therefore be ruled out that in certain circumstances the data subject is capable of exercising the rights referred to in article b and subparagraph a of the first paragraph of article of directive against that operator but not against the publisher of the web page finally it must be stated that not only does the ground under article of directive justifying the publication of a piece of personal data on a website not necessarily coincide with that which is applicable to the activity of search engines but also even where that is the case the outcome of the weighing of the interests at issue to be carried out under article f and subparagraph a of the first paragraph of article of the directive may differ according to whether the processing carried out by the operator of a search engine or that carried out by the publisher of the web page is at issue given that first the legitimate interests justifying the processing may be different and second the consequences of the processing for the data subject and in particular for his private life are not necessarily the same indeed since the inclusion in the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of a persons name of a web page and of the information contained on it relating to that person makes access to that information appreciably easier for any internet user making a search in respect of the person concerned and may play a decisive role in the dissemination of that information it is liable to constitute a more significant interference with the data subjects fundamental right to privacy than the publication on the web page in the guidelines on the implementation of the court of justice of the european union judgment in the case of google spain sl and google inc v agencia española de protección de datos aepd and mario costeja gonzález c adopted on november the article data protection working party stated as follows search engines included in web pages do not produce the same effects as external search engines on the one hand they only recover the information contained on specific web pages on the other and even if a user looks for the same person in a number of web pages internal search engines will not establish a complete profile of the affected individual and the results will not have a serious impact on him therefore as a rule the right to delisting should not apply to search engines with a restricted field of action particularly in the case of search tools of websites of newspapers from the material point of view and as its been already mentioned the ruling expressly states that the right only affects the results obtained on searches made by the name of the individual and never suggests that the complete deletion of the page from the indexes of the search engine is needed the page should still be accessible using any other terms of search it is worth mentioning that the ruling uses the term name without further specification the second part of the guidelines concerns common criteria which the data protection authorities are invited to apply in handling complaints following refusals of delisting by search engines the relevant parts of the eighth and thirteenth criteria read as follows is the data processing causing prejudice to the data subject does the data have a disproportionately negative privacy impact on the data subject the data might have a disproportionately negative impact on the data subject where a search result relates to a trivial or foolish misdemeanour which is no longer or may never have been the subject of public debate and where there is no wider public interest in the availability of the information does the data relate to a criminal offence eu member states may have different approaches as to the public availability of information about offenders and their offences specific legal provisions may exist which have an impact on the availability of such information over time data protection authorities will handle such cases in accordance with the relevant national principles and approaches as a rule data protection authorities are more likely to consider the delisting of search results relating to relatively minor offences that happened a long time ago whilst being less likely to consider the delisting of results relating to more serious ones that happened more recently however these issues call for careful consideration and will be handled on a casebycase basis after the court of appeal had given its judgment in the present case regulation eu of the european parliament and of the council of april on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data the gdpr repealed directive ec of october article of the gdpr provides as follows article right to erasure right to be forgotten the data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds appliesa the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to

the request for dereferencing against the freedom of information of internet users potentially interested in accessing the information in question the cjeu referred to the judgment in ml and ww v

failed to put on clothes the applicant refused to dress the sheriff allowed him to be present in court after a screen covering the lower half of his body was hastily constructedi the evidence the two police officers who had arrested the applicant gave evidence police officer a described edinburgh road as a major route into perth from the motorway it was a busy road and at the material time there was a continuous flow of traffic along the road he was firmly of the view that the applicants nudity in a public place would cause alarm to anyone during crossexamination by the applicant police officer a agreed that the human body was in itself decent and was not harmful or alarming he accepted that nothing in the applicants behaviour at the time of his arrest other than his nakedness gave the police any cause for concern police officer b gave evidence that she considered the fact that the applicant had no clothes on in a public place to be very strange and unusual and that she was quite shocked by it she explained that at the time edinburgh road had been very busy with vehicular and pedestrian traffic she had previously seen elderly people and children in the area and there were schools and housing nearby in crossexamination she also agreed that the human body in itself was not harmful indecent or bad but maintained that although she had been forewarned that she would be likely to see a naked man in public she had still been shocked she confirmed that no complaints had been received from members of the public the applicant gave evidence in his defence when asked by the prosecution why he was wearing no clothes he replied that he was making a stand and that were innocent until we do something wrong he did not believe that he was causing harm by not wearing clothes he said that he did not wear clothes in order to provoke a reaction although he had not always been like that as he had grown older he had thought more about his beliefs when asked what he hoped to achieve by making his stand the applicant replied that he did it because he felt that it was right and that the world changed in its own wayii the conviction and sentence the sheriff found the applicant guilty of breach of the peace and contempt of court he considered that being naked in a public place and refusing to wear clothes in a public place was conduct that would be alarming and disturbing in its context to any reasonable person in his stated case prepared in the context of the applicants later appeal the sheriff explained there was no dispute on the facts of the case i accepted that the police officers were concerned that if the appellant did not put clothes on there was a very real likelihood of him causing fear and alarm to other members of the public he continued the position of the appellant is somewhat difficult to understand he made it clear to the two police officers that he had no intention whatsoever of putting clothes on he insisted on being naked in a public place he believed that he was doing no wrong by being naked in a public place he did not accept that he had committed an offence he noted that in questioning the police officers the applicant had chosen not to differentiate between private and public places when it came to nakedness he concluded i was entirely satisfied that the conduct of the appellant with the aggravation of his refusal to wear clothing in a public place amounted to a breach of the peace the criteria for a breach of the peace as discussed in the case of smith v donnelly had been met the evidence of the appellant did not raise a doubt in my mind accordingly i convicted the appellant as libelled at sentencing the sheriff had before him the applicants previous convictions according to the stated case the applicant confirmed to the sheriff that all previous convictions were for breach of the peace the sheriffs stated case continued he acknowledged that he had spent the last five years or thereby in prison for the same offence a pattern has emerged namely that on his release from prison when he stepped out of the prison gate always naked he was immediately arrested i asked the appellant what he was hoping to achieve by insisting on being naked in public he talked about his beliefs i simply could not understand what he had to say in this regard he did not appear to be waging any campaign or making a protest he informed me that he would rather not be in prison if he was not in prison he would go back to live with his mother in a village in cornwall he had previously worked as a driver of large goods vehicles the sheriff discussed sentencing options with the applicant in his stated case he explained i enquired of him if i was minded to defer sentence for whatever reason and admit him to a bail order would he then wear clothes after some thought the appellant stated that he would not be prepared to wear clothes the sheriffs stated case concluded taking all these matters into account i could see no alternative to a custodial sentence in view of the content of the notice of previous convictions i deemed it appropriate to impose the maximum of months imprisonment which i backdated to the date that he had been taken into custody a further four months imprisonment to run concurrently was imposed for contempt of courtc the appeal the applicant sought to appeal his conviction and sentence by way of note of appeal and a draft stated case was prepared by the sheriff in september the applicant was provided with a copy of the stated case and was asked for details of any proposed changes by letter of october the applicant proposed a number of changes on october a hearing was held to consider the proposed adjustments to the case stated the applicant was brought from hmp perth to attend the hearing and blankets were provided to facilitate his attendance he was told that if he refused to wear clothes or make use of the blankets he would not be admitted into the court he refused to wear clothes or to make use of the blankets and was accordingly not permitted to attend the adjustment hearing the hearing proceeded in his absence and his requested adjustments were considered by the sheriff two adjustments were allowed and the remaining adjustments rejected concerned that the stated case was biased the applicant did not lodge it with the justiciary office on october the expiry of the applicable timelimit for lodging his appeal was deemed abandoned the applicant spent his sentence in segregation at hmp perth as he refused to wear clothes on december he was released from prison the december arrest minutes after his release on december the applicant was arrested and charged with breach of the peace for being naked in public he was detained on remand on january he was convicted of breach of the peace sentence was deferred to february for uptodate psychiatric and psychological assessments on february the applicant was sentenced to a term of twelve months imprisonment plus days unserved from previous sentences he lodged an appeal the outcome of the appeal is not known he was kept in segregation at hmp perth while in prison because he refused to dress he was released on october the october arrest minutes after his release on october the applicant was arrested and charged with breach of the peace for being naked in public he was detained on remand on november he was found guilty of breach of the peace and contempt of court on november he was sentenced to days imprisonment in respect of the breach of the peace charge together with days unserved from previous sentences plus days for contempt of court to be served consecutively he was not kept in segregation while in prison at hmp perth he was released on july the july arresta the arrest minutes after his release on july at around am the applicant was approached by two police officers on manson terrace a public road leading from hmp perth to edinburgh road the officers suggested that he put on some clothes but he refused to do so he was arrested him for breach of the peace and detained on remand he appeared in court on july and pleaded not guiltyb the trial proceedings the trial commenced on august the applicant appeared in court naked and was warned by the sheriff that if he refused to dress or to cover himself he might be held in contempt of court he refused to put on clothesi the evidence the prosecution led evidence of two police officer witnesses at trial their evidence was similar to that given at the trial and the applicants crossexamination was also in similar terms and elicited similar responses see paragraph above the applicant did not give evidence in his defence he argued that his arrest and trial violated the convention he relied inter alia on article arguing that there was no reasonable suspicion which would satisfy an objective observer that he had committed an offence article arguing that his arrest was arbitrary as it was based on the subjective belief that his nakedness was offensive article arguing that he had a strong view that there was nothing indecent about his body and that view was not being respected article arguing that he ought to have been given the right to express his views that nakedness was not indecent in the way that he had chosen to do and article arguing that he was being discriminated against because he had different views from the majority of peopleii the conviction and sentence the sheriff found that the applicants conduct on july was severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people threatened serious disturbance to the community and presented as genuinely alarming in its context to any reasonable person he therefore convicted the applicant in his stated case prepared in the context of the later appeal proceedings the sheriff referred to the applicants convention arguments and continued i should say that none of these arguments were developed to any extent and it was not always easy to see what the applicants full argument was i came to the conclusion that none of the articles suggested by the appellant had been contravened in the procedure as to the conviction handed down he explained in my view there was no doubt about the facts in this case the question was whether the conduct amounted to a breach of the peace i was of the view that the first part of the test was easily met by the conduct the appellant was walking along a public street in full view of anyone passing and he was completely naked with his private parts entirely on show such conduct would be severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people especially when it was being carried out in an ordinary public street it might be different if he had been naked somewhere in private even in a public place which was remote or where fewer people would be congregated but in or near one of the main streets of a busy town his appearance in that state would be alarming the question which was more troubling was whether the second part of the test was met would the conduct cause serious disturbance to the community i came to the conclusion that the context in which the conduct was taking place being naked in a brazen fashion in the public street with no attempt to cover himself and no obvious explanation or reason for the conduct would cause serious disturbance to the community because of the reaction of ordinary people to his presence in that state in that place that would be particularly so if the community could see that children or vulnerable old people might be present i considered that the test was met and that the charge was proved beyond reasonable doubt i therefore found the appellant guilty the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of days for the breach of the peace and days for the contempt charge together with days unspent from his previous sentence a total of days the sentences were not backdated and they were to run consecutively the total length of the sentence was therefore one year nine months and eighteen daysc the appeal the applicant sought to appeal his conviction by way of note of appeal and a draft stated case was prepared by the sheriff adjustments to the stated case were proposed by both parties and a hearing was held the applicant was not permitted to attend the hearing since he refused to wear clothes on october the applicant lodged an appeal by way of case stated relying on articles and of the convention on november the applicants application for leave to appeal was considered by the first sift judge leave was refused for the following reasons the appeal is not arguable the sheriff has carefully explained the reasons for arriving at his decision there was no infringement of the appellants rights in terms of the european convention on human rights on december the applicant was refused leave on the second sift the judges found that for the reasons given by the first sift judge the appeal was not arguable the applicant was not kept in segregation while serving his sentence at hmp perth he was released on july subsequent arrests in scotland on the same day the applicant was arrested and charged with breach of the peace he was not held in custody on august a decision was made to take no further action meanwhile on july he was arrested on the outskirts of dunfermline and charged with breach of the peace he was detained on remand and appeared at kirkcaldy sheriff court in august he was convicted of breach of the peace and detained at hmp edinburgh and hmp kilmarnock he was kept in segregation during his detention he was released on october and headed south towards his home in eastleigh b treatment while in prison background factsa medical treatment regarding lump on testicle in april the applicant discovered a lump on his right testicle he was examined in his cell but was required to wear clothes for external appointments he refused to dress and subsequently made prison complaints about alleged inadequate medical treatment when they were unsuccessful he referred the complaints to the scottish ministers but on august he was informed that they were not upheld the applicant then contacted the scottish public services ombudsman the ombudsman however he was advised that his complaint was not one which the ombudsman could pursue on february he was told that the lump had goneb visits from family and friends on august the applicant made a prison complaint that he was not allowed visits he was told in reply that he was permitted visits provided that he was appropriately dressed he referred the complaint to the internal complaints committee icc on september he was advised on september that the icc had fully endorsed the suggestion that visits be accommodated in the segregation unit he was told to discuss this with the relevant staff and book a visit no visits took place on november the applicant contacted the ombudsman with a complaint that the scottish prison service sps was unreasonably refusing to enable him to receive visits by letter dated january he was informed that the ombudsman had not upheld the complaint because according to information from the sps he had been asked to cover his genitalia when walking from a hall where he was detained to the segregation unit he had refused to do soc general dental and medical treatment on september the applicant made a prison complaint about refusal of dental and general medical treatment over the previous five years while he was in detention by reply dated september he was advised that the full range of clinical services were available to prisoners and that he was required to comply with the dress code to attend appointments he referred the complaint to the scottish ministers who did not uphold his complaintd association with other prisoners and exercise as noted above the applicant spent much of his detention in segregation even when not in segregation his ability to participate in activities and to associate with other prisoners was generally limited as long as he remained naked he was not permitted to access the gym for health and safety reasons however efforts were made to give him access to books and to explore further work or hobbies that could be conducted in his cell throughout his time in segregation the applicant was reviewed regularly by health care professionals on january the applicant complained to the prison authorities that he was not allowed to associate with other prisoners or to exercise by reply dated january he was told that he was not being denied association or exercise but had excluded himself from these activities by refusing to wear clothes the applicant referred the complaint to the icc on february but the icc decided that the current arrangements were satisfactory it noted that if the applicant were to wear clothes he would be permitted to associate with other prisoners however his choice to remain naked gave rise to serious concerns that he might be the victim of violence or unwarranted comments and the prison had an obligation to ensure his safety in march the applicant complained to the ombudsman that the sps had given an unreasonable explanation for denying him access to association and exercise by reply dated may the ombudsman informed him that his complaint had not been upheld because prison staff had confirmed that if he wore clothes he would be able to associate with other prisoners and exercise attempts to secure legal representation and exemption from court fees the applicant contacted the law society of scotland seeking details of solicitors in edinburgh experienced in judicial review he received a list containing the names of fourteen firms which he duly contacted none were willing to represent him however a further seven firms were recommended to him he contacted them and was informed that none were willing to represent him he then contacted the court of session to request information regarding exemption from court fees with a view to commencing judicial review proceedings without legal assistance he was advised that as he was a prisoner and not in receipt of any state benefits he was not eligible for exemption from court fees ii relevant domestic law and practicea criminal offences in scotland breach of the peace the leading case as to what constitutes a breach of the peace under scots law is smith v donnelly slt where the appeal court said the crime of breach of the peace can be committed in a wide variety of circumstances and in many cases it is a relatively minor crime it has therefore been said more than once that a comprehensive definition which would cover all possible circumstances is neither possible nor desirable equally in our view it is neither possible nor desirable to derive a comprehensive definition from a close analysis of the facts of individual cases in which it has been held that a breach of the peace had been committed it is in our view clear that what is required to constitute the crime is conduct severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people and threaten serious disturbance to the community what is required therefore it seems to us is conduct which does present as genuinely alarming and disturbing in its context to any reasonable person that interpretation is supported by the fact that if there is no evidence of actual alarm the conduct must be flagrant if it is to justify a conviction flagrant is a strong word and the use of that word points to a standard of conduct which would be alarming or seriously disturbing to any reasonable person in the particular circumstances we therefore conclude that the definition of the crime found in the principal authorities does meet the requirements of the convention in her majestys advocate v harris hcjac the appeal court citing smith emphasised that it was now clear that the crime of breach of the peace involved two elements conduct severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people and which threatened serious disturbance to the community the maximum sentence for a breach of the peace depends upon the court in which the offence is tried when prosecuted in summary proceedings in the sheriff court the maximum sentence is a fine of up to five thousand pounds sterling or imprisonment of one year breach of bail conditions pursuant to section b of the criminal procedure scotland act the act it is an offence to fail without reasonable excuse to comply with any condition imposed on bail section provides that a person guilty of an offence under section is liable to a fine or to imprisonment for up to twelve months contempt of court in hm advocate v airs jc contempt of court was described asconduct which challenges or affronts the authority of the court or the supremacy of the law itself every court in scotland has the inherent power to punish persons who are in contempt of it where contempt occurs in the court itself it may be dealt with immediately by the judge without a prior formal charge pursuant to section of the contempt of court act contempt of court in summary proceedings before a sheriff is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to three months b criminal proceedings in scotland the decision to prosecute in scotland the decision whether to prosecute an individual is taken by the crown office the crown office is wholly independent of the police and is under the responsibility of the scottish law officers the lord advocate and the solicitor general there are two forms of criminal procedure in scotland the most serious crimes are tried under solemn procedure on indictment determinations of fact in such cases are made by a jury less serious crimes are tried under summary procedure by a judge sitting without a jury the determination of the sentence in summary proceedings in summary proceedings the sheriff determines the sentence to be imposed on a person found guilty he is required to take into account a number of considerations including the offenders personal circumstances his criminal record or lack thereof the circumstances of the offence the age of the offender if under the absence of any previous custodial sentence any guidance issued by the high court any plea of guilty and any time spent in custody awaiting trial the court may decide that it is sufficient to admonish a person found guilty typically this may be done where the case concerns a first offence or is minor or there are other extenuating circumstances the procedure for appeal in summary proceedings section of the act provides for the possibility of lodging an appeal against conviction in summary proceedings section stipulates that leave is required pursuant to section any appeal against conviction must be by way of case stated the presiding judge at the trial must prepare a draft stated case and provide a copy to the appellant the stated case sets out the matters competent for review by the high court the facts proved in the case any points of law decided and the reasons for the decision parties to the proceedings may propose adjustments to the stated case if adjustments are proposed the judge must arrange a date for a hearing for the purpose of considering proposed adjustments once the case stated has been finalised a copy is sent to the appellant who must lodge it with the clerk of justiciary within one week of receipt if he fails to do so the appeal will be deemed abandoned under sections and of the act the decision whether to grant leave to appeal against conviction or sentence is made by a judge of the high court who if he considers that there are arguable grounds of appeal must grant leave to appeal and make such comments in writing as he considers appropriate in any other case the judge must refuse leave to appeal and give reasons in writing for the refusal c prison rules and directions the prison rules are contained in secondary legislation at the relevant time the rules were set out in the prisons and young offenders institutions scotland rules the prison rules from november the relevant rules were the prisons and young offenders institutions scotland rules the prison rules there is no material difference between the two sets of rules in so far as they applied to the applicant the references below are to the rules rules on segregation rule of the prison rules provided that a prisoner could be removed from association with other prisoners for the purpose of maintaining good order or discipline protecting the interests of any prisoner and ensuring the safety of others pursuant to rule a segregation order had to specify the nature of the removal from association and the reasons for making the order segregation was limited to a maximum of hours unless an extension had been authorised specifically by the scottish ministers for a further month at a time see rule and a prisoner was entitled to receive the reasons for his segregation and to make representations to the scottish ministers in respect of any application to extend segregation beyond hours rule provided that the prison governor was obliged to cancel a segregation order if he was advised by a medical officer that it was appropriate to do so on health or welfare grounds pursuant to rule where a prisoner was removed from association a medical officer was required to visit the prisoner as soon as practicable and thereafter as often as is necessary but at least once in every seven days similar provisions appear in rule of the prison rules rules on medical care part of the prison rules addressed health and welfare issues rule provided that the scottish ministers were required to make arrangements for the provision at every prison of appropriate medical services and facilities for the maintenance of good health the prevention of illness the care of prisoners suffering from illness or the aftercare of such prisoners rule provided that a medical officer had to attend prisoners who complained of illness at such times and with such frequency as the medical officer judged necessary in the circumstances the governor was obliged without delay to bring to the attention of a medical officer any prisoner whose physical or mental condition appeared to require attention rule rule made provision for a medical officer to make arrangements for consultation of specialists similar provisions can be found in part of the prison rules the prison rules are supplemented in this respect by the health board provision of healthcare in prisons scotland directions rules on general daily life further general obligations are set out in the prison rules these include the provision of reasonable assistance and facilities to develop relationships with family and friends facilitation of the practice of a prisoners religion or belief within the prison enabling visits to the prisoners provision of purposeful activities including work education counselling and vocational training daily opportunity to exercise and spend time in the open air and provision of reasonable facilities and opportunities to participate in recreational activities outwith normal working hours iii comparative law materials the court requested the parties to provide comparative information concerning the approach of other member states of the council of europe to nudity in public the government submitted information on the law and practice in nineteen of the fortysix other member states it appears from the data provided that of the nineteen states surveyed only the netherlands expressly criminalises public nudity it is punishable by the imposition of an administrative fine other states andorra belgium france germany and switzerland appear to penalise exhibitionism but the term is rarely defined it seems that sanctions vary but the data provided in this respect are incomplete according to the data a number of states have some form of public decency public order or public peace legislation that might extend to prohibiting public nudity belgium croatia the czech republic denmark estonia germany greece italy lithuania the netherlands san marino

sorosinspired šiptar fascist youth initiative for human rights which had received euros in the previous three years for the sole purpose of initiating social conflict in serbia the article further stated that the western ngos in serbia were foreign mercenaries working in the interest of their financers which was often against the interests of serbia which was why they were traitors the court relied on articles to and of the public information and media act and found that the text in question contained information the publishing of which was forbidden more specifically expressions such as foreign mercenary traitor sorosinspired šiptar fascist organisation initiating social conflict in serbia amounted to hate speech and in certain sections of society had incited hatred intolerance

16,the applicant was born in and lives in vienna from january she held several seminars entitled basic information on islam grundlagen des islams at the rightwing freedom party education institute bildungsinstitut der freiheitlichen partei österreichs the seminars were not only open to members of the freedom party or invited guests but were also publicly advertised on its website in addition the head of the freedom party hcs had distributed a leaflet specifically aimed at young voters advertising them as top seminars in the framework of a free education package the applicant had not been involved in the selection of participants two of the seminars were held on october and november respectively with around thirty participants at each one of the participants was an undercover journalist working for a weekly journal n at the journals request a preliminary investigation was instituted against the applicant and on february she was questioned by the police concerning certain statements she had made during the seminars which had been directed against the doctrines of islam on august the vienna public prosecutors office staatsanwaltschaft wien the public prosecutor brought charges against the applicant pursuant to article of the criminal code for inciting to hatred verhetzung hearings were held on november and on january and february at the hearing on january the vienna regional criminal court landesgericht für strafsachen wien the regional court informed the applicant that the court might adopt a different legal classification in the matter from the one contained in the charge the hearing was therefore postponed to give her time to properly prepare a defence at the end of the hearing on february the regional court acquitted the applicant in relation to several of the statements originally included in the indictment under article of the criminal code this was partly because the public prosecutor had withdrawn the indictment concerning certain statements and partly because it could not be established that the applicant had made some of the other statements exactly or at least approximately as they were worded in the indictment she was however convicted of disparaging religious doctrines herabwürdigung religiöser lehren pursuant to article of the criminal code concerning the three remaining statements she was ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings and a dayfine of euros eur for a period of days amounting to eur in total which would result in sixty days imprisonment in the event of default the court considered the applicants repeated infringements to be an aggravating factor and the fact that she did not have a previous criminal record to be a mitigating factor the court found her guilty of publicly disparaging an object of veneration of a domestic church or religious society namely muhammad the prophet of islam in a manner capable of arousing justified indignation geeignet berechtigtes ärgernis zu erregen the statements which the court found incriminating were the following english translation i one of the biggest problems we are facing today is that muhammad is seen as the ideal man the perfect human the perfect muslim that means that the highest commandment for a male muslim is to imitate muhammad to live his life this does not happen according to our social standards and laws because he was a warlord he had many women to put it like this and liked to do it with children and according to our standards he was not a perfect human we have huge problems with that today that muslims get into conflict with democracy and our value system the most important of all hadith collections recognised by all legal schools the most important is the sahih al bukhari if a hadith was quoted after bukhari one can be sure that all muslims would recognise it and unfortunately in al bukhari the thing with aisha and child sex is written ii i remember my sister i have said this several times already when sw made her famous statement in graz my sister called me and asked for gods sake did you tell sw that to which i answered no it wasnt me but you can look it up its not really a secret and her you cant say it like that and me a yearold and a sixyearold what do you call that give me an example what do we call it if it is not paedophilia her well one has to paraphrase it say it in a more diplomatic way my sister is symptomatic we have heard that so many times those were different times it wasnt okay back then and its not okay today full stop and it is still happening today one can never approve of something like that they all create their own reality because the truth is so cruel german original i eines der großen probleme die wir heute haben ist dass mohammed als der ideale mann der perfekte mensch der perfekte muslim gesehen wird das heißt das oberste gebot für einen männlichen moslem ist es mohammed nachzumachen sein leben zu leben das läuft nicht nach unseren sozialen standards und gesetzen ab weil er war ein kriegsherr hatte einen relativ großen frauenverschleiß um das jetzt einmal so auszudrücken hatte nun mal gerne mit kindern ein bisschen was und er war nach unseren begriffen kein perfekter mensch damit haben wir heute riesige probleme weil muslime mit der demokratie und unserem wertesystem in konflikt geraten die wichtigsten von allen rechtsschulen anerkannten hadith sammlungen die allerwichtigste ist die sahih al bukhari wenn eine hadith nach bukhari zitiert wurde dann können sie sicher sein dass es alle muslime anerkennen und in der al bukhari ist auch blöderweise das geschrieben mit der aisha und dem kindersex ii ich erinnere mich an meine schwester das hab ich schon ein paar mal erzählt als sw in graz ihren berühmten sager gemacht hat ruft mich meine schwester an und sagt um gottes willen hast du ihr das gesagt worauf ich gesagt habe nein ich wars nicht aber es ist nachzulesen es ist nicht wirklich ein geheimnis und sie das kann man doch so nicht sagen und ich ein jähriger und eine jährige wie nennst du das gib mir ein beispiel wie nennen wir das wenns nicht pädophilie ist sie na ja das muss man ein bisschen umschreiben diplomatischer sagen meine schwester ist symptomatisch das haben wir schon so oft gehört das waren doch andere zeiten das war damals nicht ok und es ist heute nicht ok punkt und es passiert heute auch noch so was ist nie gutzuheißen sie legen sich alle eine wirklichkeit zurecht weil die wahrheit so grausam ist the regional court found that the above statements essentially conveyed the message that muhammad had had paedophilic tendencies it stated that the applicant was referring to a marriage which muhammad had concluded with aisha a sixyearold and consummated when she had been nine the court found that by making those statements the applicant had suggested that muhammad was not a worthy subject of worship however it also found that it could not be established that the applicant had intended to decry all muslims she was not suggesting that all muslims were paedophiles but was criticising the unreflecting imitation of a role model according to the court the common definition of paedophilia was a primary sexual interest in children who had not yet reached puberty because paedophilia was behaviour which was ostracised by society and outlawed it was evident that the applicants statements were capable of causing indignation the court concluded that the applicant had intended to wrongfully accuse muhammad of having paedophilic tendencies even though criticising child marriages was justifiable she had accused a subject of religious worship of having a primary sexual interest in childrens bodies which she had deduced from his marriage with a child disregarding the point that the marriage had continued until the prophets death when aisha had already turned eighteen and had therefore passed the age of puberty in addition the court found that because of the public nature of the seminars which had not been limited to members of the freedom party it was conceivable that at least some of the participants might have been disturbed by the statements the regional court further stated that anyone who wished to exercise their rights under article of the convention was subject to duties and responsibilities such as refraining from making statements which hurt others without reason and therefore did not contribute to a debate of public interest a balancing exercise between the rights under article on the one hand and those under article on the other needed to be carried out the court considered that the applicants statements were not statements of fact but derogatory value judgments which exceeded the permissible limits it held that the applicant had not intended to approach the topic in an objective manner but had directly aimed to degrade muhammad the court stated that child marriages were not the same as paedophilia and were not only a phenomenon of islam but also used to be widespread among the european ruling dynasties furthermore the court reasoned that freedom of religion as protected by article of the convention was one of the foundations of a democratic society those who invoked their freedom of religion could not expect to be exempt from criticism and even had to accept the negation of their beliefs however the manner in which religious views were attacked could engage the states responsibility in order to guarantee the peaceful exercise of the rights under article presenting objects of religious worship in a provocative way capable of hurting the feelings of the followers of that religion could be conceived as a malicious violation of the spirit of tolerance which was one of the bases of a democratic society the court concluded that the interference with the applicants freedom of expression in the form of a criminal conviction had been justified as it had been based in law and had been necessary in a democratic society namely in order to protect religious peace in austria the applicant appealed arguing that the impugned statements were statements of fact not value judgments she referred to several of the documents which she had submitted as evidence which in her view clearly confirmed that when muhammad had been fiftysix years old he had had sexual intercourse with the nineyearold aisha she stated that it was no more than reasonable to present those facts in the light of the values of todays society it had not been her intention to disparage muhammad she had merely criticised the notion that an adult had had sexual intercourse with a nineyearold child and raised the question whether this amounted to paedophilia if one were to follow the arguments of the regional court it would mean that someone who had married a child and managed to maintain the marriage until the child had come of age could not be described as a paedophile she further contended that she had not used the term paedophile in the strict scientific sense but in the way it was used in everyday language referring to men who had sex with minors she stated that she had never said that muhammad had been a paedophile because he had married a child but because he had had sexual intercourse with one in any event her statements were covered by her rights under article of the convention which included the right to impart opinions and ideas that offended shocked or disturbed on december the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht wien hereinafter the court of appeal dismissed the applicants appeal confirming in essence the legal and factual findings of the lower court the regional court had based its findings on the facts as submitted by the applicant namely that muhammad had married aisha when she had been six years old and consummated the marriage when she had been nine it had rightly made a distinction between child marriages and paedophilia it had not based its findings on an unpredictable definition of the term paedophilia but on a common definition which was comparable to that used by the world health organisation as regards the alleged violation of article of the convention the court of appeal referring to the courts caselaw i̇a v turkey no echr viii and aydın tatlav v turkey no may found that it had to examine whether the comments at issue were merely provocative or had been intended as an abusive attack on the prophet of islam it concluded that the latter was the case as muslims would find the applicants statements he liked to do it with children the thing with aisha and child sex and a yearold and a sixyearold what do you call that give me an example what do we call it if it is not paedophilia wrong and offensive even if muhammad had married a sixyearold and had had intercourse with her when she had been nine the court of appeal stated that the reason for the applicants conviction had not been that the events had purportedly taken place more than a thousand years ago and similar conduct would no longer be tolerable under todays criminal law and contemporary moral and value concepts but because the applicant had accused muhammad of paedophilia by using the plural form children child sex what do we call it if it is not paedophilia without providing evidence that his primary sexual interest in aisha had been her not yet having reached puberty moreover there were no reliable sources for that allegation as no documentary evidence existed to suggest that his other wives or concubines had been similarly young on the contrary his first wife had been fifteen years older than him as could be seen from the documents submitted by the applicant herself even if the applicant had had the right to criticise others attempts to imitate muhammad her statements showed her intention to unnecessarily disparage and deride muslims harsh criticism of churches or religious societies religionsgesellschaften and religious traditions and practices was lawful however the permissible limits were exceeded where criticism ended and insults or mockery of a religious belief or person of worship beschimpfung oder verspottung einer religion oder von ihr verehrten personen began the interference with the applicants freedoms under article of the convention had therefore been justified as to the applicants argument that those who had participated in the seminar knew of her critical approach and could not be offended the court of appeal found that the public seminar had been offered for free to young voters by the austrian freedom party education institute and at least one participant had been offended as her complaints had led to the applicant being charged on april the applicant lodged a request for a renewal of the proceedings antrag auf erneuerung des strafverfahrens with the supreme court oberster gerichtshof pursuant to article a of the code of criminal procedure strafprozessordnung and relying on article article and article of the convention on june the applicant lodged her application with the court on december the supreme court dismissed the request for a renewal of the proceedings as regards the alleged violation of article it found that the applicants conviction under article of the criminal code constituted an interference with the right to freedom of expression which had however been justified under article of the convention referring to the courts caselaw otto preminger institut v austria september series a no a i̇a cited above wingrove v the united kingdom november reports of judgments and decisions v aydın tatlav cited above and giniewski v france no echr i it held that the aim of the interference had been to protect religious peace and the religious feelings of others and was therefore legitimate the court had stated many times that in the context of religion member states had a duty to suppress certain forms of conduct or expression that were gratuitously offensive to others and profane in cases where the impugned statements not only offended or shocked or expressed a provocative opinion but had also been considered an abusive attack on a religious group for example an abusive attack on the prophet of islam as in the applicants case a criminal conviction might be necessary to protect the freedom of religion of others where a conviction was based on article of the criminal code the principles developed under article and of the convention had to be considered when examining whether a statement was capable of arousing justified indignation a statement could not be considered as arousing indignation if it was compatible with articles and of the convention the courts therefore had to examine the meaning of the impugned statement as well as the context in which it had been made and whether the statement was based on fact or was a value judgment only by considering all of those points could the question of the ability to arouse justified indignation be examined applying the above considerations to the applicants case the supreme court held that she had not aimed to contribute to a serious debate about islam or the phenomenon of child marriage but merely to defame muhammad by accusing him of a specific sexual preference based on the assumption that he had had sexual intercourse with a prepubescent child in order to show that he was not a worthy subject of worship the court whilst not misjudging the importance of the debate about sexual contact between adults and children found that the applicant had not contributed to a debate of general interest because she had made her allegation primarily in order to defame muhammad on the basis of the regional courts findings that the applicants statements qualified as value judgments the supreme court held that they had not been a contribution to a serious debate the case had to be distinguished from the case of aydın tatlav cited above in which a scientific book published in its fifth edition had contained a passage of harsh criticism of religion which had not been offensive in the present case the criminal conviction constituted a measure necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention moreover the measure taken by the criminal court had also been proportionate as the applicant had only been ordered to pay a fine of eur the supreme court therefore dismissed the applicants request for a renewal of the proceedings the supreme courts judgment was served on the applicants counsel on january ii relevant domestic law article of the criminal code is part of section of the criminal code which inter alia lists criminally punishable offences against religious peace strafbare handlungen gegen den religiösen frieden it reads as follows article disparagement of religious doctrines whoever in circumstances where his or her behaviour is likely to arouse justified indignation publicly disparages or insults a person who or an object which is an object of veneration of a church or religious community established within the country or a dogma a lawful custom or a lawful institution of such a church or religious community shall be liable to up to six months imprisonment or a dayfine for a period of up to days article of the criminal code as in force at the relevant time read as follows article incitement to hatred whoever in a manner capable of endangering public order publicly incites to commit a hostile act against a church or religious community established within the country or against a group defined by its belonging to such a church or religious community a race a nation a tribe or a state shall be liable to up to two years imprisonment similarly whoever publicly incites against a group defined in paragraph or tries to insult or disparage it in a manner violating human dignity shall equally be held liable iii international material article of the united nations international covenant on civil and political rights provides any advocacy of national racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law the council of europe parliamentary assembly stated in its recommendation on blasphemy religious insults and hate speech against persons on grounds of their religion with regard to blasphemy religious insults and hate speech against persons on the grounds of their religion the state is responsible for determining what should count as criminal offences within the limits imposed by the case law of the european court of human rights in this connection the assembly considers that blasphemy as an insult to a religion should not be deemed a criminal offence a distinction should be made between matters relating to moral conscience and those relating to what is lawful matters which belong to the public domain and those which belong to the private sphere even though today prosecutions in this respect are rare in member states they are legion in other countries of the world the assembly notes that member states have the obligation under article of the convention to protect freedom of religion including the freedom to manifest ones religion this requires that member states protect such manifestations against disturbances by others however these rights may sometimes be subject to certain justified limitations the challenge facing the authorities is how to strike a fair balance between the interests of individuals as members of a religious community in ensuring respect for their right to manifest their religion or their right to education and the general public interest or the rights and interests of others the assembly considers that as far as it is necessary in a democratic society in accordance with article paragraph of the convention national law should only penalise expressions about religious matters which intentionally and severely disturb public order and call for public violence the european commission for democracy through law the venice commission stated in its report on the relationship between freedom of expression and freedom of religion the issue of regulation and prosecution of blasphemy religious insult and incitement to religious hatred cdlad as concerns the question of whether or not there is a need for specific supplementary legislation in the area of blasphemy religious insult and incitement to religious hatred the commission findsa that incitement to hatred including religious hatred should be the object of criminal sanctions as is the case in almost all european states b that it is neither necessary nor desirable to create an offence of religious insult that is insult to religious feelings simpliciter without the element of incitement to hatred as an essential componentc that the offence of blasphemy should be abolished which is already the case in most european states and should not be reintroduced as concerns the question of to what extent criminal legislation is adequate andor effective for the purpose of bringing about the appropriate balance between the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for ones beliefs the commission reiterates that in its view criminal sanctions are only appropriate in respect of incitement to hatred unless public order offences are appropriate notwithstanding the difficulties with enforcement of criminal legislation in this area there is a high symbolic value in the pan european introduction of criminal sanctions against incitement to hatred it gives strong signals to all parts of society and to all societies that an effective democracy can not bear behaviours and acts which undermine its core values pluralism tolerance respect for human rights and nondiscrimination it is essential however that the application of legislation against incitement to hatred be done in a nondiscriminatory manner in the commissions view instead criminal sanctions are inappropriate in respect of insult to religious feelings and even more so in respect of blasphemy the united nations human rights council stated in its resolution combating intolerance negative stereotyping and stigmatization of and discrimination incitement to violence and violence against persons based on religion or belief adopted on march the human rights council expresses its concern that incidents of religious intolerance discrimination and related violence as well as of negative stereotyping of individuals on the basis of religion or belief continue to rise around the world and condemns in this context any advocacy of religious hatred against individuals that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence and urges states to take effective measures as set forth in the present resolution consistent with their obligations under international human rights law to address and combat such incidents notes the speech given by secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference at the fifteenth session of the human rights council and draws on his call on states to take the following actions to foster a domestic environment of religious tolerance peace and respect bye speaking out against intolerance including advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violencef adopting measures to criminalize incitement to imminent violence based on religion or beliefg understanding the need to combat denigration and negative religious stereotyping of persons as well as incitement to religious hatred by strategizing and harmonizing actions at the local national regional and international levels through inter alia education and awarenessbuildingh recognizing that the open constructive and respectful debate of ideas as well as interfaith and intercultural dialogue at the local national and international levels can play a positive role in combating religious hatred incitement and violence the un human rights committee adopted at its nd session july the general comment no on freedom of opinion and freedom of expression freedom of expression is a necessary condition for the realization of the principles of transparency and accountability that are in turn essential for the promotion and protection of human rights defamation laws must be crafted with care to ensure that they comply with paragraph and that they do not serve in practice to stifle freedom of expression all such laws in particular penal defamation laws should include such defences as the defence of truth and they should not be applied with regard to those forms of expression that are not of their nature subject to verification at least with regard to comments about public figures consideration should be given to avoiding penalizing or otherwise rendering unlawful untrue statements that have been published in error but without malice in any event a public interest in the subject matter of the criticism should be recognized as a defence care should be taken by states parties to avoid excessively punitive measures and penalties where relevant states parties should place reasonable limits on the requirement for a defendant to reimburse the expenses of the successful party states parties should consider the decriminalization of defamation and in any case the application of the criminal law should only be countenanced in the most serious of cases and imprisonment is never an appropriate penalty it is impermissible for a state party to indict a person for criminal defamation but then not to proceed to trial expeditiously such a practice has a chilling effect that may unduly restrict the exercise of freedom of expression of the person concerned and others prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system including blasphemy laws are incompatible with the covenant except in the specific circumstances envisaged in article paragraph of the covenant thus for instance it would be impermissible for any such laws to discriminate in favour of or against one or certain religions or belief systems or their adherents over another or religious believers over nonbelievers nor would it be permissible for such prohibitions to be used to prevent or punish criticism of religious leaders or commentary on religious doctrine and tenets of faith laws that penalize the expression of opinions about historical facts are incompatible with the obligations that the covenant imposes on states parties in relation to the respect for freedom of opinion and expression the covenant does not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events restrictions on the right of freedom of opinion should never be imposed and with regard to freedom of expression they should not go beyond what is permitted in paragraph or required under article the european parliament in its resolution of february on the situation of fundamental rights in the european union ini held that the european parliament recalls that national laws that criminalise blasphemy restrict freedom of expression concerning religious or other beliefs that they are often applied to persecute mistreat or intimidate persons belonging to religious or other minorities and that they can have a serious inhibiting effect on freedom of expression and on freedom of religion or belief recommends that the member states decriminalise such offences the,,,

of company y had returned the money to his business partners in the film clip the applicant stated that the icelandic authorities believed that they had found the money trail and they thought that the

shown inter alia of a a prominent businessman in iceland lastly the applicant stated that the question of where the money had ended up would be answered after the authorities investigation on the evening news on may the news anchor introduced the news items by stating that the authorities were investigating whether b a and c an investor in iceland had jointly planned a business deal where isk seemed to vanish in panama furthermore the anchor stated that documents from the year and onwards supported this suspicion and that the documents indicated that the money had found its way back into the pockets of the same group in the film clip the applicant stated that the authorities believed that they had found the money trail as had been previously reported and that they were in possession of documents indicating that a b and c had planned the panama deal in advance in order to send the money to panama and then back into their own pockets again via a circuitous route pictures of a b and

pictures of a b and c were shown above a world map a pile of money was shown being divided up into three parts in panama and each part was then visually transferred to the pictures of the men on the same day a corresponding article was published on ruvs website after the news broadcast a issued a press release the online news article was updated to include the press release on january a lodged defamation proceedings against the applicant before the reykjaness district court and requested that the words a and threesome in the abovementioned statement of the news item broadcast on december be declared null and void before the domestic courts the applicant maintained that he had based the news item on information from sources both verbal and written that he deemed highly trustworthy furthermore the applicant maintained that when he had prepared the news item he had attempted to contact a by telephone in vain during the proceedings before the district court the applicant submitted a letter dated september from the special prosecutor confirming that the loan transaction which was the subject of the news items had been reported to the police and was under investigation the special prosecutor also stated that this had been confirmed in the media in july it does not transpire from the letter from the special prosecutor whether a was under investigation as a suspect or charged the applicant did not during the proceedings before the district court submit any other documents or evidence to in support of the information concerning a presented in the news items by judgment of november the district court found for the applicant in its reasoning it referred to the right to freedom of expression and the protection of private life as guaranteed by the icelandic constitution the judgment contained the following reasoning the banking collapse of caused great changes to the business environment and society in general a wave of bankruptcies hit companies and individuals the value of the krona plummeted and changes were made to the ruling government to name a few the media have covered these events since the crisis began and the individuals involved have also been the subject of news coverage including a in determining whether the content of the news item is a part of the social debate and therefore of public interest it should be kept in mind that a himself as well as the companies he has represented has been in the media and public debate for many years a has also been very prominent in business both here and abroad and in both a negative and positive light company z led by a was a large shareholder in f and held an active share in gbank news about a has therefore more often than not been about his role in the banking collapse and after the collapse of the icelandic banks in the autumn of the media was full of news on the banking collapse and crisis the reasons behind them and related matters the media have been called upon to disseminate all material that could be of public interest especially if the content might shed light on elements pertaining to parties who have played key roles in the icelandic economy in the light of the circumstances that developed after the banking collapse a will have to withstand personal discussion of his actions and participation in business loan facilities and transfers of funds occurring in the leadup to the bank failure are important news stories that are relevant to the general public restricting that discussion through sanctions should only be done after great consideration the applicant has stated that the news item is based on sources both verbal and written that he finds trustworthy the applicant can not be asked to prove these statements as the journalists right to protect his sources and their identity has been upheld in judicial rulings the applicant has also sufficiently demonstrated that he tried to contact a before he delivered the news item and he has therefore not violated the national broadcasting services procedures in that respect the court does not agree with a that he is accused of actions punishable by law in the news item the news item must be assessed as a whole and not on the basis of individual statements in the piece as previously noted the court must consider the circumstances under which the statements are made that they are necessary for a social debate on the causes and repercussions of the bank failure and also that some discrepancies can occur when dealing with complicated loan facilities and business deals when the statements on a are assessed in this light they are not found to violate the provisions of articles or of the penal code no on january a appealed against the district courts judgment to the supreme court by a judgment of november the supreme court overturned the district court judgment and ordered the applicant to pay isk approximately euros eur to a in compensation for nonpecuniary damage plus interest and isk approximately eur for as legal costs before the domestic courts the two words were declared null and void the judgment contained the following reasoning in assessing where the line should be drawn between freedom of expression as protected by article of the constitution and the right to privacy as protected by article of the constitution it is important to determine whether the content published can be considered a part of the social debate and therefore of public interest see the supreme court judgments of june in case no march in case no november in case no and november in case no the media play an important role in disseminating information and opinions on social issues the public has a right to information on such issues and there must be particularly strong reasons for determining that limitations on media freedom are warranted in a democratic society the collapse that occurred in the icelandic economy following the failure of the three icelandic commercial banks in the autumn of has had a significant and broad effect on all activity in the country and the general publics quality of life public debate and media coverage have been very focused on identifying the preceding events and reasons for the collapse and reporting on the financial business of individuals has often been personal when the content of the news item debated in this case is assessed as a whole and the disputed remarks are evaluated in context with other statements in the news report and in consideration of the visual presentation the comments clearly implied that a had committed an act which was punishable in accordance with the penal code no the applicant has not presented any documents supporting the legitimacy of the statements for which he has to bear the burden as it was incumbent on him rather than a to secure such evidence the applicant has also not demonstrated that he sought information from a on the content while preparing the news report he therefore failed in his duty as outlined in article of the national broadcast services rules on news and related programming dated may to seek information from both or all parties and attempt to show their points of view as equally as possible the supreme court therefore finds that the applicant could not have been acting in good faith as pertains to the accuracy of the remarks in the news piece therefore as demand for the quoted statements to be declared null and void is granted pursuant to article cf article of the penal code ii relevant domestic law the relevant provisions of the icelandic

to ml of a house which had been confiscated from his fatherinlaw who had once committed aggravated embezzlement of state property and of which ownership had since been transferred to the yablunivka village hospital it is such a shame that some of the officials in the kosivskyy district are not true servants of the people but leeches and traitors of their countrymen consciously undermining the authority of the young state in the eyes of the population as in the olden days with respect to the feudal lords today there is no redress against them that is why they act so daringly and with impunity it is because of such fortuitous and corrupt rulers that the independent ukraine can not rise on its feet on december ml drafted a statement of claim against the applicant and the publishing

remaining copies having been at the disposal of the district administration the book could not have been deemed disseminated ml filed an objection in which he submitted in particular that a number of officials of the district administration had read the disputed statements that some copies of the book had already been distributed to the school libraries and that the applicant himself had earlier claimed that he had distributed fifty copies of the book he also submitted letters from the head and deputy head of the district administration in which they expressed indignation with the fact that the applicant had published a gratuitous attack on mls reputation and suggested that he may have done so in revenge for mls refusal to allot a plot of land to the applicants mother on october the ivano frankivsk regional court the regional court dismissed the applicants cassation appeal and the judgment of october became final the district administration did not return its copies of the book to the publishing house according to the applicant it instead distributed a number of books to various recipients having cut out the pages which contained the disputed text on may the presidium of the regional court quashed the judgments of and october following a request by the applicant for a supervisory review протест and remitted the case to the city court for fresh examination in summer the applicant lodged a counterclaim against ml within the framework of the initial defamation proceedings he referred to a number of purported shortcomings in mls official conduct as mayor and submitted that by complaining to the authorities about the publication the mayor had simply sought to compromise the applicants reputation among his colleagues and the general public the applicant further complained that ml had published a disparaging article about him in a local newspaper and sought compensation for nonpecuniary damage and the retraction of several purportedly defamatory statements made in the article at issue this counterclaim was joined by the city court for examination together with the defamation claim brought against the applicant on september the city court transferred the case to the kosivskyy district court for examination the applicant appealed against that decision seeking a transfer of the case to his local court on october the ivano frankivsk regional court of appeal the former ivano frankivsk regional court ordered the case to be remitted to the city court having noted that that court had already started examining the case and that there were no grounds

judge of the city court to be removed from the case between october and october some five hearings were adjourned on account of the applicants failure to appear on october the city court heard the case and delivered its judgment allowing mls claim in part and dismissing the applicants counterclaim the legal part of the judgment concerning mls claim stated as follows having heard the parties and having examined the materials in the case file the court considers that the claim should be allowed in part on the following grounds statements that the mayor ml an omnipotent feudal prince had brutally breached the election legislation are rebutted by the decisions of the kosivskyy district court of june and the civil division of the ivano frankivsk regional court of july from which it follows that the claimant had not breached the election law as the claim made by the group of deputies seeking an annulment of the lists of the district election committees was dismissed statements that ml had acted outrageously towards lv are rebutted by the decision of the kosmach village council of march to grant ownership of a plot of land to lv and also the statements concerning the settlement of the matter concerning restitution of the house are rebutted by the decision of the kosivskyy district court of october in respect of the claim by ol mls spouse against ys concerning the annulment of the privatisation certificate issued in yss name the court considers that the applicant arbitrarily used the aegis of the lviv institute of internal affairs in publishing the work and inserted on pages statements unsubstantiated by evidence regard being had to the liability of the applicant the gravity of the harm inflicted on the plaintiff as a public official the fact that the publication of the false statements negatively affected his image in the eyes of the district administration his acquaintances and his fellow villagers the fact that copies of the publication had been widely read by libraries schools and the district administration and the fact that fifty copies had been taken by the applicant some of them already having been disseminated and regard also being had to the time invested by the plaintiff in the judicial examination of his case the direct liability of the applicant in inflicting harm the court considers that some compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage should be awarded the city court next awarded ml uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage to be paid by the applicant and ordered that the disputed statements be retracted the relevant passage of the operative part of the judgment read as followsthe publishing house l shall publish erratum sheets додатки to the book the kosiv area antiquities retracting the statements mentioned above that do not reflect reality to be paid for by the applicant the applicant appealed he challenged in particular the courts findings that the impugned information in the book had been disseminated widely claiming that the court had not established who had disseminated his book and exactly who had read it on february the regional court upheld the findings of the city court with respect to mls claim endorsing its reasoning as relevant and sufficient at the same time the court found that no sufficient reasons had been stated for rejecting the applicants counterclaim and remitted it to the city court for fresh examination the applicant lodged a cassation appeal in which he referred to article of the convention and the provisions of national law guaranteeing freedom of speech alleging that the judgments against him were indicative of political repression and seeking to have the findings of the lower courts with respect to mls claim overturned the applicant maintained in particular that the final three sentences challenged by the mayor had been his value judgments concerning unnamed public officials and could not have been deemed defamatory to the mayor he further maintained that he could not afford to pay the damages moreover whether ml had actually suffered any damage had never been established in particular the district administration had received four hundred and fifty out of five hundred copies of the book which had been in its possession since the day the action had been lodged the district administration had later distributed some of those books to the public in breach of the court order of october requiring it to return them to the publishing house for reprinting nevertheless the disputed statements had not reached the public as employees of the district administration had cut out the controversial pages in breach of the authors copyright what had become of the other fifty copies of the book had never been established even if members of the public had obtained access to the disputed statements this could not have affected the mayors reputation in any significant way since the applicant had only recapitulated and reported information that had already been common public knowledge in support of this allegation the applicant submitted copies of numerous newspaper articles criticising the mayor and statements by individuals claiming that they had been offended by him in various ways the applicant maintained that these documents served as sufficient evidence that his statements had been true and that he could not understand how to draft a retraction of the true statements the district administration filed objections to the applicants cassation appeal it contended in particular that they had not cut out any pages from the disputed book before distributing it ml also filed objections to the applicants cassation appeal he noted in particular that the applicants allegations that the nonpecuniary damage award was disproportionate with respect to his income were speculative since he had never disclosed his income on march the city court stayed the examination of the applicants counterclaim against ml pending consideration of the cassation appeal on june the supreme court of ukraine rejected the applicants request for leave to appeal in cassation the bailiff service instituted enforcement proceedings against the applicant in the course of which he was bound to pay the judgment debt in instalments of of his main income retirement pension it appears that the debt was paid in full by june between july and april the city court adjourned some seven hearings in the case concerning the applicants counterclaim against ml either on account of the parties absence or the unavailability of recording equipment on april the ivano frankivsk regional department of education and science informed the applicant that it had received fifty copies of the book from the district administration in thirtyfive of which had been distributed to local schools others remaining in the departments library none of the copies received had pages missing the department also noted that ml acting as a private person had distributed erratum sheets to the book recepients notifying them that the statements criticising him had been deemed false and defamatory by the courts on november the city court rejected the applicants defamation claim against ml as unsubstantiated and vexatious on january the regional court upheld that judgment and on january the rivne regional court of appeal acting as a

disseminating between december and july untrue information about the activities of the museums management the case was registered with the warsaw district court which held ten hearings on july the warsaw district court convicted the applicant of libel of the museum and its management on account of the applicants sending four anonymous letters on november to the tax office the supreme audit

accounting bullying or inappropriate activity on the part of other employees the court which heard pś and other witnesses in respect of the above allegations made by the applicant found that the museums director had not been biased against the applicant furthermore the warsaw district court found that the impugned libel did not concern pś as a private person but rather the museum as an institution and its management for the court denunciations of a wrongful conduct should rely on facts and not only on bare value judgments of the person making such denunciations defamation could take the form of the accusation of a specific factual conduct or of the voicing of a general opinion about the actions or the features of an injured party on the facts the warsaw district court found that the applicants statements contained untrue allegations which had shed a bad light on the museum and its director irrespective of whether the applicants statements had resulted in the audits or had had any other negative consequences for the museum they had clearly put the museum at risk of losing its good reputation the applicant had not acted in good faith that is to say in defence of the museums interests he had acted with direct intent to damage the reputation of the museum and its management by making allegations which had not been objectively confirmed having worked long years at the museum the applicant had been perfectly aware of the untrue nature of his statements as for the fine the warsaw district court observed that it was proportionate on the one hand to the harm caused by the applicants actions and on the other hand to the applicants income to that end the court established that the applicant made pln per month and had no dependent persons the applicant appealed arguing that the firstinstance court had erred in finding him to be the author of the letters in question and that by convicting him it had violated his human rights on january the warsaw regional court sąd okręgowy upheld that judgment the judgment was served on the applicants lawyer on april on an unspecified date the prosecutor general declined to grant the applicants request and to lodge a cassation appeal as in his view there were no grounds for it civil proceedings against the applicant according to the applicant in the museum had also brought a civil claim against him seeking

20,the applicant was born in and lives in vienna he is of bulgarian origin on july a letter signed by the applicant was sent to the sofia municipality in that letter the applicant complained of construction works undertaken by his nephew ak which had significantly altered the house which had been owned by his parents and where he had been born the applicant had become aware of that during his stay in sofia in may he expressed his indignation about the works undertaken as well as doubts as to their legality and requested to be sent copies of all documents concerning them stating that he intended to bring the matter to court he stated in addition that ak held for the property in question an illegal notarial deed acquired on the basis of a forged notarial deed these allegations concerned the notarial deeds of and described in paragraph below ak had been the beneficiary under both of them the applicant indicated an intention to challenge these deeds in court in december ak initiated a private criminal prosecution of the applicant in his complaint he stated that he had become aware of the applicants letter by chance and claimed that the applicant had defamed him in particular by stating that he had an illegal notarial deed acquired on the basis of a forged notarial deed this implied that ak had committed a criminal offence namely using a forged document in the same proceedings ak also brought a tort action against the applicant claiming bulgarian levs bgn the equivalent of euros eur in nonpecuniary damage the applicant objected to the complaint against him contending that what he had stated was true and that he had never claimed that ak had actually used the forged documents in a decision of the sofia district court of october the criminal prosecution of the applicant was discontinued as timebarred and the examination of the case continued only as regards aks tort action that action was allowed in a judgment of the sofia district court of january the domestic court stated expressly in that judgment that it did not have to establish the elements of the criminal offence of defamation it had to establish in accordance with section of the obligations and contracts act see paragraph below whether the applicants behaviour amounted to a tortious act and whether ak had suffered any damage as a result as to the facts of the case the sofia district court established that ak had become the owner of part of the property at issue after his mother had donated to him a share in and he had purchased another share from a coowner in both transactions had been attested in notarial deeds in a further notarial deed of ak had been recognised as the owner of part of the property in he had obtained a permit to enlarge the existing house the construction works had been carried out in and a representative of the building control authorities had visited the site on july and had established breaches of the relevant rules but no administrative sanction had been ordered against ak an additional check had been carried out on november after one of the coowners of the property not the applicant had complained that check had showed that part of the construction works undertaken by ak did not correspond to the construction permit it appears however that ak had not been ordered to demolish the unlawfully constructed parts further complaints by the coowners concerning the construction undertaken by ak had been sent to the municipality on may the sofia district court heard in addition witnesses who said that following the applicants allegations against him ak had become nervous and had had unspecified problems with the authorities the sofia district court found that it had never been shown that the notarial deeds in aks favour had been flawed meaning that they had to be considered valid the applicants allegations that one of these deeds had been illegal and another one forged could have affected aks good name in society as they suggested that ak had profited from using unlawful means those allegations had also damaged aks professional reputation since he was working in construction this was so even bearing in mind that the municipal authorities had taken no particular action against ak and that checks on the construction site had been incited by other coowners of the property the above considerations were valid regardless of whether the applicant had committed the criminal offence of defamation since this was not the subject of the proceedings the applicant had had resort to his constitutional right to petition the authorities but the exercise of that right did not have to involve causing damage to others the sofia district court ordered the applicant to pay ak bgn the equivalent of eur in nonpecuniary damage plus default interest it considered such an award to be just pointing out that ak had enjoyed a good name in society that the applicants allegations had also affected aks professional reputation and that the allegations had been made before a municipal body and not in private correspondence upon an appeal by the applicant in a final judgment of august the sofia city court upheld the district courts judgment endorsing its reasoning the applicant has not submitted documents showing that he actually paid the amount awarded to ak nor has he claimed to have made any such payment ii relevant domestic law and practice article of the constitution of provides that citizens have the right to make complaints proposals and petitions to the authorities article of the criminal code criminalises defamation the offence and the relevant domestic practice concerning it have been described in marinova and others v bulgaria nos and others and july section of the obligations and contracts act provides that everyone is obliged to make good the damage which they have through their fault caused to another by article of the code of criminal procedure the criminal court is obliged to rule on a civil claim that has already been accepted for examination in the criminal proceedings even after the associated criminal prosecution has become timebarred or the accused has been acquitted according to the supreme court of cassation the criminal court has to rule on a civil claim even where it can not rule on the criminal liability of the accused because civil liability stems from a tortious act and not from a criminal offence тълкувателно решение от г на вкс по тълк д г оснк решение от г на вкс по н д г i н о нкthe,,,
21,in and lives in kemerovo he was represented by mr i morokhin a lawyer practising in kemerovo the government were represented by mr m galperin representative of the russian federation to the european court of human rights the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows impugned material and its dissemination with reference to the findings made in the domestic proceedings see below the government submitted that the applicant had registered as a user on vkontakte hereinafter vk a popular online social network in russia and had created a user account by registering on vk he had accepted its use regulations that required its users to provide full and truthful information and prohibited propaganda or incitement of racial religious ethnic hatred or enmity the applicant had named his account roman kilin on june using his personal computer the applicant had connected to the internet from his home network via his internetaccess provider and uploaded a video file entitled russia granny on an unspecified date prior to november the applicant had uploaded an audio file containing a song called glory to russia performed by kolovrat a music band the video lasted for one minute and showed a young man approaching an elderly woman who was played by a man they engaged in a dialogue in the russian language for a full description of the content see annex to the present judgment russia is a socalled mockumentary also in russian directed by pavel bardin about neo nazis skinheads in russia the plot of the film came from the imagination of the author but the imaginary story was based on life in russia in the film members of a gang called russia are filming propaganda videos to post on the internet after a while they become accustomed to the camera and stop paying attention to it the leader of the gang discovers that his sister is dating a southern caucasian man this family drama develops into a tragedy the film has no closing credits but a list of people killed by skinheads in russia in at the end playing over silence the film was screened at the berlin international film festival director pavel bardin won the discovery of the year nika award for the film according to the applicant the piece was also shown on russian television channels the audio file contained a musical composition glory to russia with lyrics in the russian language see annex to the present judgment criminal proceedi ngs against the applicantinvestigation on an unspecified date and in unspecified circumstances the applicant or the relevant vk account came to the attention of the russian authorities in november the authorities created a vk account and sent a friend request to the roman kilin account after the request had been accepted the authorities gained access to the content that included the impugned video see paragraph above fortyseven people who had also been added as the accounts friends had similar access see also paragraphs and below later on the authorities also examined through their vk account the impugned audio file see paragraph above in september the regional office of the federal security service initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant his home was searched and his personal computer was seized in september the investigator commissioned a linguistic and psychological assessment of the impugned material by officials of the kemerovo state university the dean of the faculty of social and psychological studies and the deputy chair of the unit of stylistics and rhetoric on november they issued their report see paragraphs below concerning the video they made the following findingsa linguist the video was a part of a wellknown feature film russia and was a selfcontained clip in terms of its content it showed a negative encounter between an elderly woman and azerbaijanis soured because of a lack of honesty and decency implying that azerbaijani vendors fooled their clients and thereby putting forward a negative image of people of azerbaijani ethnicity the video did not refer to any specific person the negative image was not personified thus the video showed a negative image of the entire ethnic group the video contained two calls put forward by the elderly woman look maybe it is better to beat the shit out of all those blackies and to throw them throw them out of moscow well the holy cause is not tricky she takes a bat in her hands the first two indirect calls were strengthened by the last one emphasising the positive assessment of the suggested actions as well as by the ensuing actual conduct consisting in the beating up of non russian people presumably of azerbaijani origin in view of the context of the video the last call here is how russians must fight for their rights is demonstrated by the use of the words must and fight the expert concluded that the video contained a call to violence aimed at inciting discord between russians and azerbaijanis a call to beat them with a bat as well as a call to violence aimed at violating their rights a call to throw them out of moscowb psychologist the overall context of the russia film meant that its authors aimed in the impugned part to show the tools and methods of manipulative impact on the part of nationalist organisations and by implication to strengthen the protection of the individual and mass consciousness against such manipulation however when taken out of context that part acquired a different meaning by posting it as separate material that is to say without regard to and in isolation from the authors intended message the person concerned pursued his or her own message the video created a negative image of people of azerbaijani origin by attributing to them deceitful and indecent actions while omitting to make any disclaimer or reservations thus this image was intended to relate to the entire ethnic group in opposition to a russian woman who could not be deceptive and thus had to stay away from the markets taken over by azerbaijanis the video then demonstrated the actions to be taken namely physical assault against them and their removal from moscow such actions were presented as positive and were approved of as a holy cause and the way russians had to fight for their rights as to the audio they concluded as followsa linguist the content of the song opposed russians and non russians who were called blackies черные in modern russian this word was used as a pejorative in respect of the people of certain races or ethnic origins asian black or from the caucasus they were presented in the song as enemies that russians had to fight against the nationalist tone of the song followed from the use of patriotic tropes the fact that it was directed toward russians the solicitation of the support of other slavic peoples the use of the notion of our kind the non russians were depicted as dangerous the song contained several calls the blackie shit must be thrown out of russia the use of the word must come on guys lets put on our bomber jackets and boots a call to get military clothing on lets shout loud glory to russia and we will fight the expert concluded that the song contained a call to violence aimed at inciting discord between russians and non russians a call to fight against them as well as a call to violence aimed at violating their rights a call to throw them out of russiab psychologist the message of the songs author and the person who had posted it in the internet coincided the song contained a very negative depiction of non russians together with insulting and emotional adjectives while omitting to make any disclaimer or reservations thus the content concerned all non russian ethnic groups they were attributed a dominant position in russia thus the content was aimed at inciting ethnic discord between ethnic russians and those of another ethnicity the content also contained expressions calling for a fight to not give up and to win meaning violence against non russians with the aim of throwing them out of russia trial the applicant stood trial before a justice of the peace the justice of the peace held a public hearing the applicant denied that he had been the user of the vk account roman kilin according to him at the time of the criminal proceeding against him the official register of extremist materials had listed no material containing the film or part thereof or any audio material containing the lyrics of the song mentioned above the justice of the peace heard a number of witnesses who stated that through their own vk accounts they had communicated with the account roman kilin that they had had no doubt that they had been in touch with the applicant that they had been accepted as friends thus gaining access to the content of that account that they had had seen and some of them had actually accessed the impugned video and audio files on april the justice of the peace convicted the applicant under article of the criminal code see paragraph below and sentenced him to a suspended term of eighteen months imprisonment first appeal the applicant appealed to the leninskiy district court of kemerovo by a procedural decision dated july the district court decided to hold the appeal hearing in camera it stated that since the offence under article was listed in the chapter of the criminal code concerning offences against the foundations of the constitutional regime and national security it was relevant to ensure the safety of the persons participating in the proceedings it was indicated in the procedural decision that it could be appealed against to the kemerovo regional court within ten days the applicant did not appeal the applicant and his lawyers took part in the appeal hearing before the district court the applicant pleaded not guilty and refused to give any oral testimony in a judgment of august the appellate court quashed the justice of the peaces judgment considering that it did not properly describe the facts held against the applicant having reexamined the case the appellate court considered that by posting the impugned video and audio in his vk account the applicant had realised that it had been possible for them to be accessed by an unlimited number of people and had acted with the intent to incite ethnic discord национальная рознь and to incite others to commit violations of the rights and freedoms of people of non russian ethnicity нерусские национальности between june and november he had made public calls to carry out extremist activities in the appellate courts view the video and the audio contained calls to violent actions aimed at inciting ethnic discord between russians and people of other ethnicities and aimed at violating their rights and freedoms specifically the impugned video contained calls to violent actions with the aim of inducing ethnic discord between russians and people of azerbaijani ethnicity and at violating their rights and freedoms in the appellate courts view when registering a vk account and then uploading or posting information a user i had to realise that such information became accessible to all registered users of the website ii wanted that that would happen because that together with his personal details mentioned in the account reflected his interests and hobbies which helped in acquiring new friends among the website users the court concluded that in view of those considerations the information contained in a vk account was widely accessible to an unlimited number of people in reaching those conclusions the appellate court referred to the witness statements made before the justice of the peace and some other witness statements made before the justice of the peace which had not been however assessed in the firstinstance judgment mr p a deputy dean at the kemerovo state medical university stated that he had examined the impugned video and audio which had been available at the applicants account he had asked the applicant why he had posted that content the latter replied that he had posted it some six months before when he had been interested in national ideas another witness mr b stated that he had asked a similar question and that the applicant replied that he had posted it just like that that is for no particular reason mr t the applicants secondaryschool classmate stated that until late the applicants webpage had been open and that he had examined the impugned material mr s apparently a lawenforcement officer stated that in november the authorities had created a vk account and sent a friend request without any further explanation to the roman kilin account after the request had been accepted the authorities had gained access to the content that had included the impugned video fortyseven people had had similar access as they had also been added as the accounts friends the appellate court stated that in addition to those statements the applicants guilt was confirmed by some other evidencea it followed from the report issued by linguists and psychologists see paragraphs above that the communicative intention of the author of the russia film had been to uncover the means and methods used by nationalist organisations to psychologically manipulate others and thereby to reinforce individual and societal protection against such harmful influence when disseminating the video the person concerned the applicant had aimed at inciting ethnic discord and at violent and other actions aiming at violating the rights and freedoms of people of azerbaijani ethnicity the author of the impugned audio and the person who had disseminated it the applicant had aimed at inciting ethnic discord and violent and other actions aiming at violating the rights and freedoms of people of non russian ethnicities the video contained a call to violence aimed at inciting discord between russians and azerbaijanis a call to use a bat to hit azerbaijanis and a call to violent actions aimed at violating their rights and freedoms a call to throw azerbaijanis out of moscow the audio contained a call to violence aiming at inciting ethnic discord between russian and non russian ethnicities a call to fight with non russians a call to violence aimed at violating their rights and freedoms a call to expel them from russiab an audio recording of a telephone conversation between the applicant and a woman in which the applicant had stated well shoot them down and russia for russians in the context referring to people of non russian ethnicityc as to article of the criminal code calls to extremist activities could be expressed orally in writing or through another form for instance in audio or video works the fact that the person who disseminated publicly such material was not its author did not mean that the calls to extremist activities did not emanate from that person by intentionally disseminating such material that person expressed his or her endorsement or approval and intended that others would be receptive to the calls contained in the impugned material thus that person had to be held as personally wanting to incite others to carry out an extremist activityd by adding information to a personal vk account the applicant had to realise that such information became accessible to other registered vk users and wanted that outcome psychologically with the aim of acquiring new friends among users by way of sharing his personal data hobbies and interestse unlike disseminating extremist material which was an offence under the code of administrative offences prosecution under article of the criminal code required a public call for extremist activities to be carried out including ethnic discord and violation of others rights and freedoms on account of their ethnicity the appellate court sentenced the applicant to a suspended term of eighteen months imprisonment the period of probation was set to eighteen months and during that period the applicant was required to regularly report to the authority supervising the execution of sentences and was not allowed to change the place of residence or his educational institutional without notifying that authority the court referred to the nature of the offence the degree of danger to the public involved the mitigating circumstances the fact that it had been the applicants first criminal prosecution his age and his character second appeal the applicant filed a cassation appeal with the kemerovo regional court arguing as followsa there had been no evidence that he had been the user of the vk account that he had retained exclusive control over it without any unauthorised access by third parties such as the authorities through the use of the socalled sorm technologies that he had accessed from his personal computer at his home and downloaded to it or uploaded to the vk account the impugned video or audiob where a work of art such as the russia film or the glory to russia song had not been classified as extremist material under the suppression of extremism act a quotation from that work of art could not be perceived or classified in a criminal case as calling for extremist activitiesc the appellate court had not established any calls to extremist activities on the part of the applicant as required under article of the criminal code instead he had in substance been convicted of disseminating extremist material which was an offence under article of the code of administrative offencesd there had been no valid reason under article of the code of criminal procedure to hold the appeal hearing in camera on november the regional court upheld the appeal decision of august the regional courts decision did not specify whether a public hearing had been held however it stated as follows having examined at the hearing on november the cassation appeal statement submitted by the applicants lawyers and having heard the opinion expressed by the applicant and his lawyers and the prosecutor the court has decided as follows indeed the appeal court decided under article of the code of criminal procedure to hold the hearing in camera and issued a related decision providing the reasons in it it follows from the material in the case file that the justice of the peace held a public hearing at which the evidence submitted by the parties

a frying pan prepared in advance broke some eggs into it and fried them over the eternal flame at the tomb of the unknown soldier two of her friends joined her and fried sausages on skewers over the flame another member of the group filmed the event two police officers approached them and made a remark that their behaviour was inappropriate without further interference on the same day the

memorial in kyiv for fiftythree years now this pleasure costs taxpayers about hryvnias uah per month and this is only one eternal flame pagan temple whereas there are hundreds or even thousands of them throughout ukraine on december the st luke brotherhood reacted to this by an act of protest in the glory park in the capital it showed that people should use the eternal flame we suggest to the outraged representatives of the communist party of ukraine to follow the example of ancient roman vestal virgins and to carry out aroundtheclock duty at the eternal flames keeping the fire lit manually by wood there is no doubt that communists will have no problems with fulfilling this task because they already have experience of taking care of the lenin monument in kyiv and their financing is much better than that which the vestal virgins had while the parties did not provide a copy of the video in question to the court it was possible to view it on several publicly available websites in addition to the factual account from the parties summarised above the court notes that the soundtrack to the video was a famous soviet song the battle is going on again devoted to the victory of

eternal flame the participants in the performance did not make any public address and their conversation was not audible they had no posters or other visual aids apart from the food and cooking utensils it could be seen on the video that once the applicant had broken the eggs in the frying pan and was about to approach the fire while her friends held skewers with sausages the two police officers appeared and the applicant explained something to them and they left in order to reach the flame the applicant had to step over a sculpture of a wreath of oak leaves and step on the words

they had allegedly explained to her they had been hungry and had intended to cook food in order to eat it on the same day criminal proceedings were instituted against d and three unidentified persons on suspicion of hooliganism on december d wrote a confession that she had participated in a protest against inappropriate use of natural gas and that she regretted it she knew only the first names of the other participants on december another criminal case was opened against her and three unidentified persons in respect of the same event this time on suspicion of desecration of a tomb it was joined to that opened earlier subsequently the charge of hooliganism was dropped the police retrieved photos of several persons who might have been involved in the incident from the passport offices

applicant was suspected was punishable by a prison term of more than three years the applicant had absconded as a result of which she had been declared wanted by the police and she could reoffend or hinder the establishment of the truth if at liberty on march a judge of the pecherskyy court allowed that application in part he ordered the applicants arrest with a view to bringing her before the court for examination on march at pm the applicant was arrested at the flat of a certain z in kyiv as the latter subsequently stated during her questioning the applicant had been living there from march at the request of an acquaintance on march the applicant was questioned as an accused in the presence of her lawyer while insisting that her only intention had been to protest against the inappropriate use of natural gas she confessed to the offence and expressed remorse on the same day the investigator once again applied to the pecherskyy court for the applicants detention as a preventive measure his reasoning was the same as before on march and april two deputies of the kyiv regional council applied to the pecherskyy court for the applicants release in exchange of their personal guarantee of her adequate procedural behaviour on april the pecherskyy court remanded the applicant in custody as a preventive measure pending trial it noted that she was accused of a serious offence punishable by imprisonment of from three to five years furthermore the judge referred to the fact that the applicant had absconded and had therefore been put on the wanted list it was also considered that she might hinder establishing the truth if at liberty in so far as the applicants lawyer relied on her positive character references from various sources the court noted that those could not guarantee her compliance with all the procedural requirements while having noted that the applicant also relied on the letters of personal guarantee from the peoples deputies the judge did not further comment on them it was specified in the ruling that the term of the applicants detention was to be calculated from march under the applicable legislation the duration of pretrial detention was limited to two months with the possibility of further extensions the applicants lawyer appealed he submitted that his client was willing to cooperate with the investigation and that there were no reasons for her detention it was further pointed out in the appeal that the applicant had been declared wanted by the police on the very same day the criminal case against her had been opened the lawyer noted that there had not been a single summons sent by the investigation to the applicants address prior to her arrest according to her she had found out about the charge against her only on the day of her arrest on march lastly the lawyer submitted that the firstinstance court had not considered any less intrusive preventive measures as an alternative to detention and that it had left without consideration the people deputies letters of guarantee on april the kyiv city court of appeal rejected the above appeal it noted that the pecherskyy court had already duly examined all the arguments raised in it on may the applicant was indicted on the same day the case was sent to the pecherskyy court for trial on june the applicant applied to the court for release under an undertaking not to abscond she submitted that she enjoyed positive character references had no criminal record and had cooperated with the investigation furthermore the applicant observed that by that time the investigation had already been completed and could not therefore be hampered she emphasised that her actions had been nothing else than a protest driven by good motives several members of parliament and other prominent figures joined her in that application and expressed their wish to act as her personal guarantors on june the pecherskyy court held a preparatory hearing during which it rejected the applicants application for release with reference to the seriousness of the charge against her the nature and the circumstances of the offence of which she was accused as well as the fact that she had been declared wanted by the police the judge also stated in general terms that there were no grounds for the applicants release under a personal guarantee on june the applicant applied once again to be released on the same day the pecherskyy court allowed that application and released her under an undertaking not to leave the town on october the pecherskyy court found the applicant guilty of the desecration of the tomb of the unknown soldier acting as part of a group of persons following a prior conspiracy the court noted that the applicant had convinced d and two other people whose identities remained unestablished to carry out a performance at the eternal glory memorial aimed at protesting against the waste of natural gas caused by the burning of the eternal flame d who was questioned in court confirmed that account of events the court also questioned the memorial keeper who had witnessed the performance from a distance and the two police officers who had spoken to the applicant and her friends see paragraph above furthermore the court examined the videorecording of the performance as material evidence the judgment mentioned the statement made by the applicant during the hearing that in her opinion people bringing flowers to the memorial did not really understand what exactly it was dedicated to she insisted that she had not committed any crime as her performance had not been meant to desecrate the tomb of the unknown soldier furthermore she maintained that there could not be a tomb beneath the eternal flame because of the gas pipe the pecherskyy court held that the applicants arguments had no impact on the legal classification of her actions and that they were refuted by the evidence as a whole the judgment further stated in that regard the court considers that by committing deliberate acts in a group which showed disrespect for the burial place of the unknown soldier and for the public tradition of honouring the memory of soldiers who perished defending or liberating kyiv and the lands of ukraine from the fascist hordes and by subsequently presenting those actions as a protest the applicant has tried to escape social condemnation of her conduct and criminal liability for the offence relying on local authority documents the court dismissed the applicants submission that there was no established location for the tomb of the unknown soldier the court did not discern any aggravating or mitigating circumstances in the case at the same time in deciding on the penalty it took into account on the one hand the fact that the applicant did not have a criminal record that she was working as a political analyst and got positive character references by her place of residence and work on the other hand the court noted that the criminal offence in question was of medium gravity and that the applicant did not show any remorse for what she had done as a result she was sentenced to three years imprisonment suspended for two years on the same date the pecherskyy court exempted d from criminal liability under the surety of her employer the applicant appealed relying on the definition of the desecration of a burial place under the burial and funeral business act see paragraph below she maintained that in the absence of any intention by her to defile the family or social memory of a deceased or to show contempt for a burial place or social and religious principles and traditions there were no constituent elements of a crime in her actions the applicant reiterated her argument that her performance had been nothing more than a protest lastly she submitted that the criminal proceedings against her had violated her right to freedom of expression under article of the convention the prosecutor also appealed considering the sentence to be too lenient on december the kyiv city court of appeal upheld the judgment of the firstinstance court it stated that desecration of a tomb could have different expressions indicating an insulting attitude mockery or disrespect towards a tomb or the person buried therein regardless of the stated motives as regards the applicants argument on her right to freedom of expression the court noted that that right was not unlimited and that the restriction in the applicants case was in accordance with the law and pursued a legitimate aim the appellate court also rejected the prosecutors appeal the applicant further reiterated her arguments in an appeal on points of law lodged by her which was however rejected by the higher specialised court for civil and criminal matters on april ii relevant domestic law and practicea applicable legislation and relevant legal opinions article of the constitution of ukraine provides that international treaties which

or destruction or tearing off its clothing desecration is characterised by an objective element that is the commission of certain acts in respect of a deceased or a burial place and by a subjective element that is realising that those acts amount to contempt for the memory of the deceased which violate the principles of public life in that area most often desecration takes the form of an action

demonstrate hisher contempt for the generally recognised norms and rules of peoples attitudes towards the dead and their burial places boasts of hisher pseudobravery or seeks to assert himselfherself in the eyes of surrounding people by humiliating others and their feelings in other words they are motives which are considered from the viewpoint of public morality as disgraceful and ignoble aiming

requested that the applicant and the trade union should pay pln approximately eur to a charity and cover the costs of the proceedings gg provided evidence to show that all the statements made by the applicant about him had been untrue the harvest festival in blichów had been a tradition for many years and had been held in the same locality regardless of local elections the suggestion that

mayor had been involved in or was responsible for fixing the remuneration of local councillors and mayors domestic law clearly assigned responsibility in that regard to the local council the applicant was incorrect in quoting the amount of debt incurred on behalf of the municipality the correct amount was approximately pln not pln he was also incorrect in stating that an increase in taxes was planned when nothing of the sort had been considered the debts were to be paid off from the municipalitys own income derived from improvements in the collection of taxes not from an increase in taxes

approximately eur to a charity andf the applicant and the trade union jointly pay pln approximately eur in costs the regional court did not examine the part of the claim which related to the charity in which ggs wife had been treasurer ruling that the charity itself should have lodged a complaint the court considered that both the applicant and gg had participated in the election campaign the two editions of the newsletter had been almost entirely dedicated to issues pertaining to the election and to mayor gg as a person whose activities had been analysed in detail and criticised therefore the two editions of the newsletter had to be considered as campaign material and the case had to be examined under the procedure provided for by the election code the court emphasised that this summary procedure was intended to ensure fairness in the elections and to limit any adverse consequences of the dissemination of false information during that period the press had a duty to disseminate information in a responsible manner and based on facts otherwise the author and the publisher could be held liable as provided for by law the court considered that the applicants newsletters were examples of a negative campaign against gg consisting of gossip insinuations and allegations of a sensationalist and speculative nature that played on the emotions of readers for instance the applicant had intimidated readers with the allegedly negative impact of the wind farm on human health and had suggested that gg had devised an uncertain future for local inhabitants in connection with the charitys finances the applicant had used expressions such as the case reeks a new scandal was unfolding and the prosecutors should get involved in connection with the false information about the increase in taxes the applicant stated that gg would reach into peoples pockets according to the court such statements were aimed at manipulating the emotions of readers and the information provided had lacked details or references to its sources such statements violated the principles of good journalism and breached the personal rights of the claimant they unjustly placed him in a bad light and tarnished his good name the court further noted that gg had produced conclusive evidence that the applicants statements of fact had been untrue he had quoted inaccurate figures concerning the municipal debt the size of ggs landholding and the percentage of the planned increase in taxes the point made about the mayor being solely responsible for commissioning the wind farm and for setting the amount of the allowances of local councillors and mayors and the assertion that contrary to the law he had been involved in additional paid activities had all been untrue the court concluded as follows taking into account the number and gravity of the allegations the applicant and the trade union should cease disseminating such information apologise publicly and privately to gg and receive a financial punishment for the unjustified breach of the personal rights of the claimant in respect of his good name honesty competency responsibility for the financial standing of the municipality and integrity on october the applicant represented by a lawyer lodged an appeal against the decision the applicant argued that the newsletters could not be considered campaign material and that the claimant could not receive protection under article of the election code the applicant submitted that the september edition of the newsletter had been published prior to the date on which gg had officially become a candidate in the election moreover the newsletters could not be campaign material as they had not supported any candidate running for election on october the płock regional court allowed an application by gg to supplement the decision of october by adding a requirement that the correction of the false statements and the apology be published by october on october the łódź court of appeal dismissed the appeal in the first sentence of its written reasons the court stated as follows it should above all be emphasised that in his appeal the applicant does not question the assessment by the firstinstance court that the statements made in the publications in question were untrue the court examined the arguments raised in the appeal and dismissed them taking the view that article of the election code covered all forms of speech linked to election campaigns for speech to be covered by this provision it did not have to originate from the campaign committee of a candidate it included all statements made during the campaign and in connection with the election the court emphasised that in election campaigning the use of all available media was a common and legal practice provided that the information was true and that the value judgments were based on sufficient facts the newsletters in question although apparently not supporting any particular candidate had openly agitated against the incumbent mayor gg they were representative of a negative campaign aimed at discouraging the electorate from voting for a candidate the election campaign began in august so the dates on which both newsletters had been published fell within the period of campaigning the date on which gg had formally been declared a candidate for the post of mayor of the municipality was irrelevant lastly the court observed that the applicants engagement in the campaign had been in clear breach of the law since members of electoral commissions of which he was one were banned from active participation in the campaign on october the płock electoral commissioner warned the applicant that if he continued campaigning his membership of the electoral commission for the municipality of bulkowo would be revoked the local government elections took place on november gg was reelected as mayor of the municipality of bulkowo in the płock regional court agreed to the applicant paying

24,represented by ms t abazadze and then by ms n jomarjidze lawyers practising in tbilisi the government were represented by their agent mr b dzamashvili of the ministry of justice the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows the first and second applicants are journalists who at the material time worked as respectively the managing director of the third applicant and the editorinchief of a weekly newspaper published by the latter in the third applicants office in batumi started receiving reports from local people of arbitrary customs clearance practices being conducted by georgian border police officers at the checkpoint in sarpi on the state border between turkey and georgia the sarpi checkpoint the first and second applicants decided to respond to the calls by conducting a journalistic investigation on august the first and second applicants crossed the state border in the direction of turkey and headed back after passing passport control they without anything to declare entered the restricted customs control zone of the sarpi checkpoint where newly arrived passengers were filling in customs declarations and duties were being levied on imported goods the restricted zone was enclosed by a fence which had multiple warning signs on it saying customs control zone the second applicant started interviewing people who were in the process of declaring imported goods to customs officers while the first applicant took photographs of the scene they had already recorded interviews with all the travellers present when a customs officer warned them that they were hindering the smooth running of the customs operation and that since they did not have anything to declare they had to vacate the restricted customs control zone the applicants refused referring to the freedom to exercise their profession as journalists as they saw fit they refused to leave the restricted zone even after the chief customs officer repeatedly told them to vacate the premises as a result the two applicants were fined georgian laris gel approximately euros eur each for disobeying the customs officers lawful orders an administrative offence under article of the customs code of georgia the customs code they were then escorted out of the restricted zone neither their recording equipment nor recorded interviews were confiscated in the week following the incident of august at the sarpi checkpoint the batumelebi newspaper featured a comprehensive article about the customs procedures presenting all the findings of the first and second applicants journalistic investigation including the interviews recorded in the customs control zone on the above date on november the first and second applicants acting in their individual capacity filed a court action requesting annulment of the administrative sanction imposed on them on august they claimed that it had had no legal basis that their conduct in the customs control zone of the sarpi checkpoint had been in no way disruptive and that they had merely been exercising their profession as journalists they further argued that their journalistic freedom had been undermined as a result of being sanctioned for interviewing people in the customs control zone the interviews had according to them been a necessary step in the process of preparing their journalistic investigation see paragraph above by a judgment of february the tbilisi city court dismissed the first and second applicants action as illfounded after hearing the parties submissions and examining witness statements and other evidence available in the case file the court found that their conduct on august in the customs control zone of the sarpi checkpoint had disrupted the customs procedures more specifically it was established that the questions put by the second applicant to the people declaring imported goods had prompted the importers to start arguing with the customs officers over the accuracy of the amounts of customs duties being levied it had been because of that disturbance that the customs officers had ordered the two applicants to vacate the restricted zone the city court emphasised that the order had been lawful since the applicants had entered the zone without prior authorisation in flagrant breach of article of the customs code and articles and of order no of the minister of finance of december since the applicants had not obeyed the repeated orders of the customs officers the imposition of the fine had been both lawful that is to say based on article of the same code and proportionate as regards the first and second applicants reference to their journalistic freedom the city court reiterated that they had been fined not for exercising their profession as journalists but for breaches of the relevant customs rules namely unauthorised entry into the customs control zone and failure to comply with the customs officers lawful orders the court stated that journalists could not be immune from the rules that applied to the general public if the applicants had wished in their capacity as journalists to monitor the unfolding of the customs procedures in the restricted zone of the sarpi checkpoint all they had had to do was obtain prior authorisation to access the premises and act appropriately once inside without stirring up trouble it had also been open to the applicants to gather the desired information about the customs procedures by alternative and less intrusive means for instance by interviewing people already at the exit of the checkpoint after they had declared the imported goods and paid the relevant duties on march the first and second applicants filed an appeal against the judgment of february they contested the lower courts establishment of the facts claiming that they had not caused any real disturbance in the customs control zone of the sarpi checkpoint and that all they had been doing had been interviewing and taking pictures of the importers of goods and the customs officers the two applicants also called into question the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the customs code by the lower court arguing that the provisions were not sufficiently foreseeable as regards their effects lastly they reiterated their complaint about the fine representing a disproportionate interference with journalistic freedom by a decision of june the tbilisi court of appeal after reexamining the case on both issues of fact and law fully upheld the lower courts judgment of february the appellate court clarified that since the first and second applicants had entered the sarpi checkpoint from the turkish side as ordinary passengers they had been obliged to abide by the customs rules applicable to all in other words they had had no right to enter the restricted customs control zone without anything to declare and without permission from the customs office after being given lawful orders to vacate the unlawfully accessed premises the first and second applicants had had to obey them being journalists did not absolve them from the obligation to respect the law the appellate court emphasised that the relevant provisions of the customs code supplemented by articles and of order no were sufficiently clear and precise in their wording and that the two applicants could thus easily have foreseen the consequences of their wrongful conduct especially in view of the fact that they had been duly warned by the customs officers before being fined the appellate court further reiterated that it had been open to the two applicants to conduct the interviews with the newly arrived passengers not inside the customs control zone but already at the exit of the checkpoint alternatively if they had wished to record the customs clearance procedures they should have sought authorisation from the customs office in accordance with article of the customs code on december an appeal on points of law lodged by the first and second applicants calling into question the foreseeability of the legal provisions that had served as the basis for the sanction was rejected by the supreme court of georgia as inadmissible which brought the proceedings to an end relevant legal framework article of the customs code of georgia as in force at the material time provided as follows the circulation of goods

25,the applicant was born in and lives in helsinki the applicant is a journalist with a nationwide evening newspaper ilta sanomat on july ilta sanomat published an article written by the applicant concerning the investigation into a homicide which had been committed a few days earlier the article referred to ku a wellknown finnish businessman the front page of the edition carried a headline cruel killing in vantaa the executed man had connections with ku a photograph of ku also appeared on the front page the article itself was entitled the victim of the vantaa homicide had connections with ku under a smaller heading the suspect in the cruel execution killing is a former member of the motorcycle gang the article read po who was brutally killed in vantaa may have had connections with the businessman ku in po was captured trying to smuggle bags containing money from estonia into finland the police suspect that those bags with contents belonged to kuthe incident is currently pending before the prosecutor for the consideration of charges po is suspected of an aggravated receiving offence and ku of aggravated debtors fraud in that connection other suspects besides po and ku have also been exposed regarding that case in practice po is being considered as a suspected receiver the leader of the investigation criminal inspector mi of the national bureau of investigation keskusrikospoliisi centralkriminalpolisen says that the ku connection is a part of the investigation into the vantaa homicide under the following subheading the suspect admitted to being at the scene the article went on the police have detained a year old man as a suspect in pos murder in the light of the current evidence the detained person has no connection with ku says the inspector the article continued with information concerning the detained person and the ongoing investigation into the homicide it quoted the investigators statement that it was possible that the suspect had been acting under commission which according to the applicant implied the possibility of a contract killing the article was illustrated by a photograph apparently taken in the vicinity of the crime scene next to the article there was a separate information column concerning kus previous conviction for economic crimes and his academic achievements under a heading who the column reproduced a photograph of ku taken at the public defence of his doctoral thesis on the same date the same information was published in the other evening newspaper iltalehti in the form of an interview given by ku on april the public prosecutor preferred charges against the applicant and hs the newspapers editorinchief at the time in his indictment the prosecutor maintained that by writing and allowing publication of the above article the applicant and hs had given false information about ku in a manner that had been conducive to causing him suffering and damage and to subjecting him to contempt and that they had also disparaged him in other ways the prosecutor did not allege that the information imparted in the article had been false as such but contended inter alia that the combination of large headings with question marks the text of the article the photographs of ku and his personal profile had aimed to insinuate to the readership that ku might have had a motive to commission the killing ku for his part requested that the applicant and hs be punished and claimed compensation for suffering and legal costs in the same proceedings he contended that the defendants had unlawfully connected him with murder in finlands largest evening newspaper the use of his photograph taken at the public defence of his doctoral thesis had added to his suffering as he was thus defamed as an academic which was to be his future career according to ku the worst part of the criminal act had been the combination of the heading and his photograph and the image thus created in the minds of those people who had not read the article itself the defendants had sought to profit by their act in addition to the permanent stigma ku maintained that the offence had brought shame and distress to his family the applicant and hs contested the charge and the civil claims their main arguments were the following the article did not contain any false information nor could it have disparaged ku or caused him suffering the latter point was highlighted by the fact that ku had himself given an interview concerning the same matter to another evening newspaper published on the same date the article concerned a criminal investigation of general interest and was based on information given by the authorities ku was a public figure and his connection with po had been an issue of general interest and significance in itself by pressing charges the prosecutor had unnecessarily interfered with the defendants freedom of expression protected by the constitution and article of the convention when heard in person at the district courts oral hearing hs submitted inter alia that ku had contacted him after the article had been published he had been very hurt and upset hs had then offered him the possibility of rectification according to the documents ku had turned down that offer on august the helsinki district court käräjäoikeus tingsrätten issued its judgment it convicted the applicant and hs of defamation pursuant to chapter article paragraph point of the penal code the applicant was sentenced to dayfines amounting to a total of euros eur she was also ordered to pay ku jointly and severally with hs eur for suffering and eur in legal costs in its reasons the court noted that it had to examine the conflicting interests of freedom of expression and the right to privacy referring to sections and of the constitution and article of the convention it also made reference to the supreme court precedent no kko where that court found that the freedom of expression did not justify violation of a persons honour or private life in assessing the article written by the applicant the court found as follows it is undisputed that in the summer of ku was a public figure it is also undisputed that the article did not contain factual errors thus each piece of information contained therein was accurate the district court has to assess whether the article included such insinuations that have been conducive to causing suffering or contempt or if it was disparaging in other aspects the article covered the pretrial investigation of a homicide which had taken place a few days earlier as well as another largescale case concerning economic crime already pending before the prosecutor the same person had been the victim of the homicide and one of the suspects in the economic offences ku had known the victim of the homicide and was also one of the suspects in the case concerning economic offences the defendants have pleaded inter alia that the newspaper had been obliged to report on crime the article had emphasised the connection between ku and the victim of the homicide in the district courts view no such circumstances have emerged in these proceedings which would have linked the fact that ku had known the victim of the homicide to his public activities nor has it been established that the fact that ku knew the victim had been of general interest or that this piece of news had had such significance to society that it had been important to publish it the district court concluded the most central topics of the article had been the connection with the victim of the homicide and ku suspicions of economic offences organised crime and a possible contract killing the use of the heading the victim of the vantaa homicide had connections with ku along with the background information on ku under a title who illustrated with his photograph had personified the whole article to ku although the heading of the article carried a question mark and the first paragraph in the text mentioned that the victim might italics added here have had connections with ku the text does not provide an immediate answer to that question nor does it state clearly that the victim and ku had known each other only from other circumstances the article had left the answers open as the text dealt with the connection between the victim of the homicide and ku and at the end a possible contract killing ku had also been connected with a contract killing connecting a person groundlessly with a contract killing violates his honour by combining information received and statements given by the head of the investigation and by mixing two different criminal investigations the article has given an ambiguous picture of the connection between those cases the headings and the information concentrating on kus personal profile had made ku the main common feature of the crimes the district court finds that in the article ku had been linked with a homicide in a manner that insinuated a connection between ku and the commission of the homicide and a contract killing such an insinuation violates kus honour and has caused him suffering the district court was composed of one professional judge and three lay judges one of the lay judges was in favour of an acquittal in his dissenting opinion he stressed the fact that all the information presented in the article had been accurate in his view the mere fact that a party to the case his family or friends were shocked about the news coverage or that the readers of a newspaper were not fully able to comprehend the text could not constitute defamation the applicant and hs appealed against the judgment to the helsinki court of appeal hovioikeus hovrätten relying mainly on their previous arguments they also contested the lower courts interpretation of the law on november the court of appeal upheld the district courts judgment in its reasoning the appellate court reiterated that giving false information or making false insinuations about another person in a manner conducive to causing damage or suffering to that person or subjecting that person to contempt constituted defamation as set out in chapter article paragraph point of the penal code it referred to the relevant government bill for the amendment of that provision he vp in stating that it was characteristic of that offence to concern false factual information or a false insinuation bearing a close resemblance to factual information in principle the veracity of an argument may be reviewed afterwards if an argument is accurate or if the insinuation concerns a fact the act may nevertheless be punishable as defamation under point of the provision if the information is given or insinuation made with a view to disparaging another person deliberately the court then found that it is undisputed that the information in the article published in ilta sanomat on july concerning two different criminal matters was accurate as such the common feature of those matters has been the fact that ku and the victim of the homicide had been suspects in one of the criminal cases mentioned in the article the headings of the article the text and the photographs of ku on the cover and on the article have however created a connection falsely implying that ku was somehow involved in the homicide the heading of the article and its tone were such that the fact that ku was not strictly speaking an accomplice to the homicide only became clear on reading through the article more closely it followed that chapter article paragraph point of the penal code was to be applied in this case as indicated by the district court the court of appeal went on to assess in detail whether the defendants conduct could be regarded as intentional the court found that the applicant was a professional journalist and that she must have considered it probable that her article contained a false insinuation and that this false insinuation was capable of causing suffering reaching thus an affirmative conclusion the court found no reason to deviate from the outcome of the lower courts judgment on november the supreme court korkein oikeus högsta domstolen

26,the first applicant was born in and lives in helsinki the applicant company has its seat in helsinki the applicants a publisher and a publishing company wrote and published together with the former girlfriend of the prime minister at the time an autobiographical book about her relationship with the prime minister the book described a period of nine months in their lives from the point of view of the girlfriend a single mother the prime minister had earlier divorced his wife the book described the dating couples life and their intimate interaction the book was published on february the prime minister held office from june to june when he stepped down on october the public prosecutor brought charges under chapter section of the penal code against the first applicant and the girlfriend for having disclosed information about the prime ministers private life yksityiselämää loukkaavan tiedon levittäminen spridande av information som kränker privatlivet he also requested that the proceeds of the crime received by the applicant company be ordered forfeit to the state in accordance with chapter section of the penal code the prime minister concurred with the charges brought by the public prosecutor against the first applicant he also pursued a compensation claim against the first applicant which was joined to the criminal charges the girlfriend has lodged a separate application with the court see ruusunen v finland no on february the book was withdrawn from sale on march the helsinki district court käräjäoikeus tingsrätten after having voted dismissed the charges against the first applicant and rejected the request that the proceeds of the crime received by the applicant company be ordered forfeit to the state it found that the book disclosed a lot of information about the prime ministers private life but that he had already widely disclosed information about his family and habits as well as about his relationship with the girlfriend even though he himself had published an autobiography in had given several interviews ran a blog and even permitted photographs to be taken at his home he was known as a politician who strictly controlled his public image the book also contained some information which had not previously been disclosed to the public in this respect the court found that these new details only completed the information the prime minister had disclosed earlier it was never suggested that the facts disclosed were not true the book covered a period of nine months in the girlfriends and the prime ministers private life the court found that the girlfriend had the right to recount her private life she also described the prime minister his actions and family in a compassionate manner the court found that even though the information disclosed in the book had no direct relevance to the prime ministers political functions or his hierarchical position in the state it had relevance as far as the prime ministers person was concerned the constitution required that ministers were known to be honest and competent moreover the book described a situation in which two different realities of present day finnish society met a wealthy party leader and prime minister on the one hand and a single mother with everyday money problems on the other hand the court found that the fact that the girlfriend was writing about her life and her relationship with one of the highest authorities in the country did not restrict but in fact widened her freedom of expression when weighing the freedom of expression against the protection of private life the court found that the need to resort to criminal liability decreased when the disclosed information became more widely known criminal liability was the last resort in guiding human behaviour and its use had to be proportionate the court could therefore not hold that the publication of the applicants book was a criminal act moreover as the first applicant had obtained an opinion from a lawyer before publishing the book he could not be regarded as having acted with intent and could not therefore be considered as a perpetrator by letter dated april the public prosecutor appealed to the helsinki appeal court hovioikeus hovrätten the prime minister also appealed on february the helsinki appeal court convicted the first applicant for disseminating information violating personal privacy and sentenced him to dayfines in total euros he was ordered to pay the prime minister euros plus interest for nonpecuniary damage and euros plus interest for his costs and expenses before the district court and the appeal court the proceeds of the crime euros were ordered forfeit to the state the applicant company was to receive euros as compensation for its costs and expenses before the district court the court found that the passages in the book concerning the prime ministers intimate dating and his childrens feelings and behaviour unnecessarily violated the core areas of his protected private life he had not previously disclosed these details of his private life in the media the fact that he had disclosed some parts of his private life the protection of which was due to his status much narrower than a private persons did not mean that he could not benefit at all from any protection of his private life he had thus not waived his right to the protection of private life nor implicitly consented to the disclosure of information concerning details of his private life even though the girlfriend had the right to write about her private life disclosure of intimate details of another persons private life always required his or her consent the aim of the applicants book had been to discuss matters of private life and it had no relevance to the prime ministers political functions or his hierarchical position in the state nor had it any relevance to the assessment of his personal qualities such as any lack of honesty and judgment as the relationship fell within the core areas of his private life and had no relevance to his position as prime minister moreover the first applicant could be held as a perpetrator even though he had obtained a legal opinion about the book before its publication his acts had been intentional by letter dated april the applicants appealed to the supreme court korkein oikeus högsta domstolen requesting that the court establish a precedent in the case as the court had not yet in its caselaw assessed freedom of expression in the context of an autobiography on june the supreme court granted the applicants leave to appeal on june the supreme court after having held an oral hearing upheld the appeal courts conviction but quashed the forfeiture in respect of the first applicant and reduced the costs and expenses to be paid to the prime minister for the proceedings before the district court and the appeal court to euros plus interest the first applicant was ordered to pay the prime minister euros plus interest for his costs and expenses before the supreme court the applicant company was to receive euros as compensation for its costs and expenses before that court in particular by referring extensively to the courts caselaw the supreme court gave a more narrow scope to the prime ministers private life than the appeal court the court found that information about the prime ministers sex life and intimate events and his childrens feelings and behaviour had not been disclosed to the public before the fact that some details of his private life had been disclosed before did not mean that they could not fall within the scope of criminal liability under chapter section of the penal code the prime minister had not waived his right to protection of private life in these respects nor had he given his consent to their publication by consenting to the use of his photograph on the cover of the book the court considered contrary to the appeal court that the information about how and when the prime minister had met the girlfriend and how quickly their relationship had developed had had relevance to general public discussion as these issues had raised the question of whether in this respect he had been dishonest and lacked judgment also the information concerning the great differences in the standard of living between the girlfriend and the prime minister his lifestyle the data protection concerns and the protection of the highest political authorities in general had had relevance to general public discussion the court found also that disclosure of information about the prime ministers children was not conducive to causing him damage suffering and contempt as the girlfriend had only given her own interpretation of the childrens attitudes however the only references which according to the court had illegally disclosed information about the prime ministers private life were the information and hints about the sex life and intimate events between the girlfriend and the prime minister the court enumerated in particular seven parts of the book which contained information about the start of the sex life in the beginning of their relationship descriptions of their brief and passionate intimate moments as well as giving massages to each other and accounts of their sexual intercourse the court found that such information and hints fell within the core area of private life and their unauthorised publication was conducive of causing the prime minister suffering and contempt it was thus necessary to restrict the applicants freedom of expression in this respect in order to protect

association of friends of the nd k refused to answer the questions on october ks lawyer requested the applicant company to publish a rectification regarding the passages from the article cited above in her reply k stated notably that she had not been involved in the disappearance of sed assets when the applicant company refused to publish the reply on october k lodged an application for an injunction with the berlin regional court on october the court dismissed her application it found that the impugned article had not made the alleged connection between k and the disappearance of sed assets it further found that the fact that the text could be interpreted in such a way was insufficient to warrant a rectification k appealed against the decision on november the court of appeal informed her lawyer of its doubts regarding the length of her reply and a revised text was submitted on november the court of appeal relying on section of the berlin press act see paragraph below allowed the application for an injunction and ordered the applicant company to publish the following rectification you write about me she sits on the partys federal arbitration commission thats wrong since january i have not been a member of the commission you write the name k stands for a chapter in the partys history the handling of the seds assets worth billions after the peaceful revolution in

counsel for k in the subsequent main proceedings on december the berlin regional court again dismissed ks application for an injunction essentially for the same reasons as those on which it had relied previously see paragraph above again k lodged an appeal in response the applicant company argued inter alia that k had no legitimate interest in respect of the matter addressed by the third point of her reply see paragraph above since prior to the publication of the article she had refused to answer the applicant companys question regarding her membership of the nd see paragraph above furthermore the text of her reply was dated october whereas the latest version had only been submitted to the applicant company on december it further argued that the information about the two abovementioned companies that k had provided in her reply had been unnecessary for the purposes of the rectification on january the court of appeal again ordered the applicant company to publish ks reply the court ordered that the reply be printed on page of the newspaper and rejected ks demand for a frontpage announcement of the rectification it considered that although the article had not explicitly alleged that k had concealed sed party assets such a conclusion would be reached by the average reader the article had linked ks name with the disappearance of sed party assets after the statement contained in the article that there was no evidence for any criminal activities had not offset the implication that k had been involved in the disappearance of the assets since it had been presented alongside the information that k had maintained and continued to maintain ties to companies that had been funded with party assets regarding the length and content of the rectification the court of appeal noted that the wording of the rectification had been limited to what was necessary to refute the impugned statements contained in the original article given the level of detail provided in the article about ks links with those companies it considered that k for her part should be granted the opportunity to give her view on the origin of those companies capital stammkapital furthermore k had been under no obligation to answer the applicant companys questions the refusal to do so had therefore not called into question her legitimate interest in having the reply published lastly the date under the text could not be considered to be manifestly incorrect the first request for a rectification had been sent to the applicant company on october and while k had modified the text several times on the basis of the courts legal concerns the core message of the reply had remained the same on february the applicant company published the requested rectification printed below the rectification was a note from the editor stating that the information contained in it was correct and that the newspaper had no knowledge connecting k to the disappearance of sed party assets by a decision of august no bv r the

with z had been approved and signed by the banks highest management the external audit concluded that there was no evidence that payments had been made for services or goods that had not been received

applicant had provided the respective information to the nra journalists the government stated that the applicant had provided this information to the journalists on several occasions and that his comments which had contained concrete descriptions of als actions had been provided in the form of facts susceptible of proof the applicant however stated that he had only on one occasion provided a

management they had still needed to be verified by the banks internal audit the following excerpts are from nine articles which were published between and october and which were based on the

activities in respect of which no documentation the relevant contracts deliveryacceptance deeds etc has been provided the transfer of this sum in an unknown direction nezināmā virzienā actually amounts to the destruction of the banks available assets as the applicant suggested to nra either somebody is receiving this paid money back or krājbankas money is being used to create advertising of a completely different kind than that indicated in the available documents this is money that has been stolen from the shareholders the applicant stated moreover significant advance payments were made for services to be provided within a year shortly before a change in krājbankas management at the beginning of the supervisory board has ordered an internal audit to discover where these funds have disappeared to documents in the possession of nra show that the role of al in the affair of the strange advertising funds transfers could be quite significant the banks public relations unit has

significant information published in nra october edition article written by kp and el advertising for the pastors party with krājbankas money the applicant confirmed to nra that the advertising agency

documentary certification in respect of the expenditure of that money nra has already repeatedly written about the longstanding battle among krājbankas shareholders during which al was accused several

seeking compensation and the retraction of a total of thirtyone allegedly defamatory articles he also indicated that the applicant had provided false information to nra which had formed the basis of the abovementioned nine articles see paragraph above proceedings before the firstinstance court during a hearing of january the applicant admitted before the firstinstance court that the information concerning the possible misappropriation of krājbankas funds which he had provided to nra had proved to be incorrect he made the following statements the information was wrong unfounded as part of my duties i was carrying out my task of managing the banks activities i was not interested in als private life i have always respected him i tried to organise my work correctly as to the mistake regarding numbers there was one and i apologise to al and to the journalists al worked at the bank and worked in accordance with its budget al made decisions there were others responsible for the banks budget the bank did not overpay for its advertisements the mistake regarding numbers could not have offended als honour and dignity there were no public statements maybe there were other people who provided more information to the press on october the riga regional court rīgas apgabaltiesa delivered its judgment dismissing the claims against the applicant the court concluded that the nine articles in question see paragraph above which had been based on the information provided by the applicant had reported his personal opinion about the functioning of krājbanka and its management which could not be considered defamatory moreover no claim for defamatory information to be retracted was lodged against the applicant the claims against both publishers of nra preses nams and mediju nams were partly upheld in so far as they concerned six out of the nine articles which had been based on information provided by the applicant and six other articles reporting on other matters proceedings before the appellate court on may the civil cases chamber of the supreme court augstākās tiesas civillietu tiesu palāta after appeals by al preses nams and mediju nams reexamined the case and delivered a new judgment the judgment took immediate effect the appellate court noted that at the material time the press and other mass media had been widely reporting on the parliamentary elections that is to say the political parties and their leaders including the newlyestablished political party of which al was one of the leaders he had stood for election his candidacy had been widely advertised and it had been accordingly examined by the press and other mass media nra had published a series of articles about the money spent on the preelection advertising of the latvias first party linking the source of these funds to krājbanka and its former president al it had been reported that during his time in office lvl had been transferred for advertising and marketing purposes without any documentary proof thereof having been preserved and that this had been considered to constitute a misappropriation of the banks funds these funds had been spent on the partys largescale advertising as the applicant had put it this money has been stolen from the shareholders the nine articles had also contained other information provided by the applicant that during als time in office there had been breaches not only in relation to the advertising expenses but also other breaches in respect of banking operations payments without approval the administration of certificate accounts against the interests of the bank and the state the appellate court stated that the information contained in those articles about the use of krājbankas funds and transactions had been provided by the applicant who had mentioned specific sums and that the articles had contained references to his statements the appellate court found that since the applicant had provided this information to nra journalists he had to bear responsibility for giving and disseminating false information the court held that this information had not corresponded to the facts and that this had been acknowledged by the applicant himself during the hearing before the firstinstance court see paragraph above this had also been confirmed by the results of the external audit and by the prosecution see paragraphs and the court also held that the journalists had not had a responsibility to verify the accuracy of the provided information since the applicants status as the chairman of the supervisory board of krājbanka had created a legitimate expectation that the provided information was correct lastly the court found that even if the margin of permissible criticism in respect of al as a member of parliament was necessarily a wider one than would normally be the case the false information had nevertheless offended his honour and dignity as it had contained serious allegations of unlawful activities and had given the impression that al was a dishonest person given the above and in view of the seriousness of the interference and the applicants position in the bank the court ordered the applicant to pay compensation to al in connection with the nine articles in the amount of lvl approximately eur together with statutory interest per annum in addition the court upheld the claim against preses nams alone in respect of one other article and ordered it to pay compensation in the amount of lvl approximately eur together with statutory interest per annum the applicant and preses nams were also ordered to pay als legal costs in the amount of lvl approximately eur and lvl approximately eur respectively the appellate court dismissed als claims against preses nams and mediju nams as regards all the other articles that had not been based on any information provided by the applicant proceedings before the senate of the supreme court on june the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the senate of the supreme court augstākās tiesas senāts he did not contest that the information he had provided to the journalists had turned out not to be supported by evidence however this information had constituted his evaluation of the actions taken by krājbankas management as a whole he had not directly mentioned al by name surname or his position when giving the information to the journalists his allegations regarding the misappropriation of krājbankas funds could only have infringed the interests of the bank as a legal entity it could not have offended the honour and dignity of certain executives who had been under an obligation to inform the supervisory board and the mass media of the truth furthermore the applicant had provided the information in the form of a supposition by indicating that it still needed to be verified by the banks internal audit it was the nra journalists who had linked the applicants report with the allegations of wrongdoing by al thus the applicant could not be held responsible for the manner in which the journalists had decided to present this information since he had had no means of influencing this on january the senate of the supreme court delivered a new judgment which in essence upheld the appellate courts judgment the relevant parts of the judgement read as follows the appellate courts conclusion that the applicant had disseminated defamatory and false information was supported by the applicants own submissions before the firstinstance court in which he admitted that he had provided incorrect information to the journalists the fact that this information was not truthful was confirmed by the audit agency and the prosecution the applicant in his appeal on points of law did not contest these findings he merely noted that he was a source and could not influence the evaluation given by the journalists having examined the testimony of the nra journalists the appellate court found that the false information provided by the applicant had related not to krājbankas management as the applicant indicated but specifically to al as the then president of the bank thus infringing his honour and dignity the appellate court found that the journalists had had no reason to doubt the credibility of the information as it had been provided by the applicant in his capacity as chairman of the supervisory board of krājbanka and his position had undoubtedly created a legitimate expectation that this information was true accordingly the appellate court rightly held that the journalists had had no obligation to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the applicant al had requested compensation in the amount of lvl from the applicant by granting his claim the appellate court taking into account the scope of the distributed information and its audience rightly considered it justified the senate of the supreme court also upheld the claim against preses nams alone in respect of one other article they held that als honour and dignity had not been offended in other articles the appellate court had referred to the courts caselaw and had taken into account als status and the fact that he had refused to offer comment the appellate court had correctly applied the relevant principle that the journalistic freedom also covered possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation the senate referred to as diena and ozoliņš v latvia no july in this regard referring to section a of the civil law and section of the law on the mass media the senate of the supreme court ordered the applicant who had disseminated that defamatory information and not preses nams to retract the relevant parts of the articles in question see paragraph above the latter however still

29,the applicant was born in and lives in paris a background to the case on october mr bernard borrel a judge who at the time had been seconded as technical adviser to the djiboutian minister of justice was found dead kilometres from the city of djibouti his halfnaked and partially burnt body was lying some metres below a remote road in early november the investigation by the local gendarmerie concluded that he had committed suicide by selfimmolation in november a judicial investigation was opened in toulouse to establish the cause of the judges death his body on its repatriation to france was interred in toulouse in february an autopsy was carried out on the judges remains and its conclusion notified to his widow was that he had committed suicide after dowsing himself in petrol in february mrs elisabeth borrel the widow of bernard borrel disputing that finding filed a complaint as a civil party against a person or persons unknown for premeditated murder in april a judicial investigation was opened in july a private forensic report commissioned by the civil party concluded that in view of the total absence of burn residue in the judges lungs he must already have been dead when his body caught fire the judicial investigation was subsequently transferred to paris where the case was assigned in late october to ms m assisted by mr ll both investigating judges at the paris tribunal de grande instance in march the investigating judges visited djibouti without the civil parties while mrs borrel was challenging the suicide conclusion a witness a former member of the djiboutian presidential guard who had found asylum in belgium came forward in december and lent support to the theory of premeditated murder implicating the former chief of staff of the president of djibouti his testimony proved highly controversial and was widely reported in the press and other media in january the investigating judge ms m interviewed the witness in brussels after which he challenged her impartiality alleging that she had put pressure on him to withdraw his testimony in the context of the judicial investigation in respect of the premeditated murder charge three professional unions including the union syndicale des magistrats the usm applied on february to be joined to the case as civil parties lastly in early march the investigating judges accompanied by the director of the paris institute of forensic medicine and the deputy public prosecutor of paris paid another visit to djibouti in order to stage a reenactment at the scene without the civil parties being present they had asked to participate but their visa applications had been turned down on june the case was withdrawn from the two investigating judges by the paris court of appeal as it regarded as unjustified their refusal to order a new visit to djibouti with the participation of the civil parties the case was transferred to another investigating judge mr pb criminal proceedings against the applicant the applicant is mrs borrels lawyer on july a general meeting of the judges of the paris tribunal de grande instance held in paris examined among other things the situation of the judge ms m it had been announced in the press that the minister of justice had referred to the conseil supérieur de la magistrature national legal service council a dossier concerning the church of scientology which she had been working on as investigating judge and in which certain shortcomings had been noted during that meeting a judge mr jm stated as follows we are not prohibited as grassroots judges from saying that we are friends of ms m it is not forbidden to say that ms m has our support and trust on september the applicant and a fellow lawyer wrote a letter to the minister of justice in connection with the judicial investigation into judge borrels death they stated that they were complaining again to the minister of justice about the conduct of judges m and ll which was completely at odds with the principles of impartiality and fairness they asked for an investigation to be carried out by the general inspectorate of judicial services into the numerous shortcomings which had been brought to light in the course of the judicial investigation they added that after the case had been withdrawn from investigating judges m and ll by a judgment of the indictments division of the paris court of appeal dated june all of the evidence had been transmitted to the new judge on june noting that a video recording made during an onsite visit by the investigating judges unaccompanied by the civil parties was not in the file thus transmitted the lawyers protested about this to the new judge on august they pointed out that the new judge had received that evidence on the same day and in their view this showed that judges m and ll had been sitting on this videocassette also forgetting to place it under seal for over a month after the case was withdrawn from them they further stated that the judge on opening the cassettes cover had discovered an envelope containing a letter addressed to judge m about which they commented that its content was revealing and the literary quality of this letter was such that it obliged them to reproduce it for the minister of justice in full especially as it came from the public prosecutor of the republic of djibouti mr ds the letter read as follows salut marie paule je tenvoie comme convenu la cassette vidéo du transport au goubet jespère que limage sera satisfaisante jai regardé lémission sans aucun doute sur tfjai pu constater à nouveau combien madame borrel et ses avocats sont décidés à continuer leur entreprise de manipulation je tappellerai bientôt passe le bonjour à roger sil est rentré de même quà jcdje tembrasse djama hi marie paule as agreed i am sending you the videocassette of the goubet site visit i hope the picture will be clear enough i watched the show without any doubt on tfi noticed once again how mrs borrel and her lawyers were determined to carry on their manipulation ill call you soon say hello to roger if hes back and also to jcdbest wishes djama the lawyers continued their letter as follows the form and substance of the letter reveal moreover a surprising and regrettable complicit intimacy between the french judges and the djibouti public prosecutor a judicial authority placed directly under the government of which the head is very openly and very seriously suspected of being the instigator of bernard borrels murder this type of information is clearly capable of explaining the firm and constant determination of the investigating judges to stop the civil parties and their lawyers from attending the reenactments held in djibouti as you are aware this particularly delicate case concerns the death of a french judge and his widow herself a judge can not accept such conduct on the part of other judges in disregard of the most basic rules not only those of the procedure but also those requiring respect for the victims in those circumstances we are obliged to bring this matter to your attention to seek your assurance that all the shortcomings will be fully scrutinised the newspaper le monde published an article dated september entitled borrel case judge ms impartiality called into question the journalist reported in the article that mrs borrels lawyers had vigorously criticised judge m to the minister of justice it was stated that the applicant and his colleague had accused the judge of conduct which was completely at odds with the principles of impartiality and fairness and that the judge seemed to have omitted to register an item from the case file and to transmit it to her successor the article further stated judges m and ll had been sitting on this videocassette protests the lawyer olivier morice and also forgot to place it under seal for over a month after the case was withdrawn from them the article continued as follows to make matters worse in the envelope judge p found a handwritten and rather friendly note by ds the public prosecutor of djibouti the wording of the note found inside the cassettes cover was then reproduced in the article which added mrs borrels lawyers are obviously furious this letter shows the extent of the connivance which exists between the djibouti public prosecutor and the french judges exclaims mr morice and one can not but find it outrageous it was then stated that the lawyers had asked the minister of justice to initiate an investigation by the general inspectorate of judicial services on and october the two judges in question lodged a criminal complaint for public defamation of a civil servant against the editorinchief of le monde the journalist who had written the article and the applicant applying to join the proceedings as civil parties the defendants were committed to stand trial before the nanterre tribunal de grande instance by an order of the investigating judge dated october the complaint concerned the following passages of the article published on september she judge m is accused by lawyers olivier morice and ld of conduct which is completely at odds with the principles of impartiality and fairness and seems to have omitted to register an item from the case file and to transmit it to her successor judges m and ll had been sitting on this cassette protests olivier morice and also forgot to place it under seal for over a month after the case was withdrawn from them to make matters worse in the envelope judge p found a handwritten and rather friendly note mrs borrels lawyers are obviously furious this letter shows the extent of the connivance which exists between the djibouti public prosecutor and the french judges exclaims mr morice and one can not but find it outrageous the court hearing took place on april and the judgment was delivered on june the applicant first invoked the immunity provided for under section of the freedom of the press act of july the court rejected that argument finding that the action taken by the applicant and his colleague in writing to the minister of justice could not be regarded as connected to judicial proceedings or documents adduced before a court of law within the meaning of section of that act the court then examined whether the comments at issue were defamatory it noted at the outset that this had not been meaningfully disputed and that the applicant stood by the content of his allegations that he considered well founded concerning the first passage the court noted that the quotation was correct the letter to the minister having been included in the case file it added that the accusation of impartiality sic and unfairness proffered against a judge clearly constituted a particularly defamatory allegation because it was tantamount to calling into question her qualities her moral and professional rigour and ultimately her capacity to discharge her duties as a judge as regards the cassette it noted that the comments reflected at least some negligence in the handling of the judicial investigation and also cast doubt on the professional integrity of the two investigating judges it added that read as a whole the comments suggested that the cassette had only been included in the proceedings because it had been demanded by the lawyers then by the judge himself and that it had been necessary as it were to thwart and denounce a sort of obstruction on the part of judges m and ll it took the view that such assertions had to be classified as defamatory as they necessarily impugned a persons honour and reputation within the meaning of section of the freedom of the press act as regards the last of the impugned passages the court noted that the defamatory weight of the term connivance was the only aspect to have given rise to debate it noted that this term followed a number of other defamatory passages of which the highly negative wording and one can not but find it outrageous proved the deliberately strong connotation of the word connivance according to the court the use of that word clearly and directly suggested that on account of their good relations with the djibouti public prosecutor judges m and ll had been collaborating with that official of a foreign country in investigating the case in a partial and unfair manner in breach of the basic principles of law and of judicial office the court found that the defamatory nature of those views was exacerbated by the subsequent indication in the article that the lawyers had asked the minister of justice to initiate an investigation by the general inspectorate of judicial services thus implying that they had a serious basis on which to substantiate such an accusation as to the applicants guilt the court noted that the law of july provided that a person supplying defamatory information to a journalist in the knowledge that it would be published could be convicted for instigation of public defamation the court noted that in the present case the applicant had confirmed at the hearing that he had spoken on the telephone with the journalist who had drafted the article and had made the comments as reported the court concluded that it was established that the applicant had supplied information to a journalist of the daily newspaper le monde for the purposes of publication making comments of which the defamatory nature was patent as to the applicants offer to bring evidence the court pointed out that in order to be admitted the evidence had to be perfect and complete and to relate directly to all the accusations found to be defamatory as regards the shortcomings in the judicial investigation the court noted that it was still in progress and that the judgment of june had expressed disapproval with the refusal by the judges concerned to proceed with the reenactment requested by the civil party and had acted thereon by ordering the case to be withdrawn from them it took the view however that it could not be inferred that all the criticisms made in open court about the handling of the judicial investigation should be regarded as founded as regards the retention of the cassette the court noted that no offer of evidence had been seriously made in order to establish any professional misconduct or dishonest conduct on the part of the investigating judges lastly as to the term connivance the court stressed that a possible convergence of opinion between participants in the judicial process without its precise extent having been determined did not in any way prove the existence of a culpable complicity with the aim of distorting the investigation procedure it concluded that the applicant had failed in all his offers to bring evidence in support of his good faith the applicant referred to the duties that were inherent in his mission of defending clients and the results obtained in response to the requests of the civil party since the withdrawal of the case from judges m and ll the court refused however to admit his defence of good faith finding that the highly virulent attacks on the professional and moral integrity of the investigating judges clearly overstepped the right of legitimately admissible free criticism the court thus found mr morice guilty of instigating the public defamation of judges m and ll it sentenced him to a fine of euros eur and ordered him to pay jointly with the journalist and publication director of le monde eur to each of the two judges the court further ordered that an announcement be published in the newspaper le monde at their shared expense all the parties to the proceedings appealed against that judgment the versailles court of appeal delivered its judgment on may it held that judge lls appeal was timebarred and upheld the three convictions for defamation against judge m it increased the amount of the fines imposed on the applicants codefendants from to euros and to euros respectively however it confirmed the amount of the fine imposed on the applicant and that of the damages awarded and also the order to have an announcement published in le monde in a judgment of october on appeals by the applicant and judge ll the court of cassation finding that the reasoning was inconsistent and that judge lls appeal was not timebarred quashed the court of appeals judgment in its entirety it remitted the case to the rouen court of appeal which thus had to rule on the criminal and civilparty actions against the three defendants in relation to judge ll and on the criminal and civil actions against the applicant alone in relation to judge m after a number of adjournments the hearing before the rouen court of appeal was held on april in its judgment of july that court looked again at the defamatory nature of the impugned comments as regards the conduct of judge m the court found that to say about an investigating judge that in the handling of a case she had shown conduct which was completely at odds with the principles of impartiality and fairness or in other words conduct incompatible with professional ethics and her judicial oath was a particularly defamatory accusation because it was tantamount to accusing her of lacking integrity and of deliberately failing in her duties as a judge thus questioning her capacity to discharge those duties as to the delay in the transmission of the cassette the court noted that the applicants comments not only accused the judges of negligence in the handling of the case thereby discrediting the professional competence of the judges but above all implied that the latter had kept hold of the cassette after the case was withdrawn from them with the intention at least of causing obstruction allegedly it was only because the lawyers had raised the matter with p followed by that judges request to judge m that the item of evidence had been obtained and finally transmitted on august the court of appeal added that such assertions attributing to those judges a deliberate failure to perform the duties inherent in their office and a lack of integrity in the fulfilment of their obligations constituted factual accusations which impugned their honour and reputation it found this to be all the more true as the applicant referring to the handwritten note from the public prosecutor of djibouti had emphasised this atmosphere of suspicion and the negligent conduct of the judges by stating that this document proved the extent of the connivance between them and the prosecutor the court noted on that point that the word thus used implied that on account of those good relations judge m had been able to conceal the truth and conduct her investigation in a partial and unfair manner in breach of professional ethics and the fundamental principles governing the office of judge the court added that such an allegation accusing the two judges of a total breach of the duties inherent in their office represented in itself a serious attack on their honour and reputation it merely served to confirm the defamatory nature of the previous comments especially as the article added that the applicant had asked the minister of justice for an inspection by the general inspectorate of judicial services the court of appeal concluded that the offending passages characterised the offence of public defamation against civil servants as to the applicants offer to bring evidence the court of appeal referring in part to the arguments of the court below took the view that none of the items produced showed on the part of the judges any unfair or partial conduct any failure to perform the duties inherent in their office or any lack of integrity in the handling of the case concerning the death of judge borrel it concluded that the veracity of the defamatory allegations had not been established as regards the applicants defence of good faith the court noted that he had referred to the duties that were inherent in his mission of defending clients the results obtained in the case since the change of investigating judge and the judicial decisions taken thereafter it found however that at the time of the articles publication the highly virulent attacks on the professional and moral integrity of the two judges in comments that seriously questioned their impartiality and intellectual honesty clearly overstepping the right to free criticism was no longer of any procedural interest because the case had already been withdrawn from them the court found that the particularly defamatory comments made by the applicant in the press against the two judges revealed by their excessive nature the intensity of the conflict between him and in particular judge m it considered the comments to amount to an ex post facto settling of scores as shown by their inclusion as the applicant had wished in an article published in le monde on september according to the court on that date the applicant could not have been unaware that the investigation division of the paris court of appeal had just begun to examine at his request as lawyer acting for the civil parties the case of the church of scientology in which m as investigating judge in the case was suspected of being responsible for the disappearance of documents it concluded that this showed on the part of the applicant personal animosity and an intention to discredit those judges in particular judge m with whom he had been in conflict in various cases thus ruling out his good faith consequently the court of appeal upheld the judgment of the court below found the applicant guilty of instigating the offence of defamation against a civil servant sentenced him to a fine of eur and jointly with his two codefendants awarded eur in damages to each of the civil parties it also ordered the publication of an announcement in le monde the defendants and judge m lodged an appeal on points of law against that judgment the applicant relied in particular on article of the convention arguing that the immunity provided for in section of the freedom of the press act protected the lawyer in respect of any oral or written comments made in the context of any type of judicial proceedings in particular of a disciplinary nature it followed in his submission that the letter of september to the minister of justice for the purpose of asking the national legal service council conseil supérieur de la magistrature to take action against two judges who had been responsible for investigating the case in question fell within the context of the defence of the civil partys interests accordingly in his view the court of appeal had not been entitled to refuse to grant immunity from suit in respect of the allegedly defamatory comments contained in that letter on the ground that it did not constitute an act of referral that could be covered by the term pleadings in section of the abovementioned act on that point the court of cassation found that the court of appeal had justified its decision by taking the view that the fact of making public the letter to the minister of justice seeking an investigation by the general inspectorate of judicial services into the shortcomings attributed to the two investigating judges did not constitute an act of referral to the national legal service council and was not part of any proceedings involving the exercise of defence rights before a court of law the applicant further relied on article of the convention asserting that the impugned comments concerned a court case that had for a long time received media coverage and the questionable manner in which the investigation had been conducted having regard to the importance of the subject of general interest in the context of which the comments had been made the court of appeal was not entitled to find that he had overstepped the bounds of his freedom of expression he contended that good faith was to be assessed in the light of the impugned comments that had been published he added that the mere fact that he had had a disagreement with one of the judges in the context of another set of proceedings did not prove that he was driven by any personal animosity lastly he argued that opinions expressed about the functioning of a basic institution of the state like the handling of a criminal investigation were not subject to a duty of prudence in the expression of thought the court of cassation took the view that the court of appeal had justified its decision while everyone had the right to freedom of expression and while the public had a legitimate interest in receiving information on criminal proceedings and the functioning of the courts the exercise of those freedoms entailed duties and responsibilities and could be subject as in the present case where the admissible limits of freedom of expression in criticising the action of judges had been overstepped to restrictions or sanctions prescribed by law which constituted measures that were necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation and rights of others it dismissed the appeals by a judgment of november the bench which gave that judgment included in particular mr jm see paragraph above ii relevant domestic law the relevant provisions of the freedom of the press

30,the first applicant mr h armellini was born in and lives in hard the second applicant mr f andres was born in and lives in bregenz they are both journalists employed by the third applicant zeitungs und verlags gmb h a limited liability company with its seat of business in schwarzach the applicant company publishes the regional newspaper neue voralberger tageszeitung a the background of the case at the beginning of rh a german football referee admitted to having participated in bet rigging wettbetrug by manipulating football matches together with other persons in particular the brothers fs ms and as rh told the police that he knew that football matches were also manipulated in greece and austria as regards austria he referred to the football club casino sw bregenz which still existed at the time of the events in b the article published by the applicant company on february an article written by the first and second applicants appeared in the neue voralberger tageszeitung dealing with the german betting scandals links to bregenz on the front page the headline printed in a black box in white read as follows bregenz players bribed with euros eur bregenz spieler mit bestochen below that headline and still in the black box were photographs of at dg and ai and in a yellow box the phrase the investigators are at the heels of this trio they may have manipulated matches for the bettingmafia diesem trio sind die fahnder auf den fersen es soll für wett mafia spiele manipuliert haben in the upper left corner a little box contained the following phrase terrible suspicion against football pros confirmed schlimmer vedacht gegen fussball profis erhärtet the main article on this subject written by the first and second applicants appeared on page the headline read as follows sold and betrayed the team for eur für team verkauft und verraten the article stated that the three football players had been bribed by the bettingmafia with eur for three matches bets for these casino sw bregenz matches had been placed in the stuttgart area germany in one match which had ended with the result of against casino sw bregenz the goalkeeper at had made serious mistakes as expected and another player ai had been replaced because of his poor performance dg had also been playing in that match the reason for the manipulations was the players financial difficulties they had not received their salary for months they had all signed a public statement prepared by the management of the club denying their involvement in the betting scandal on the following page there was an article under the headline a result shocks a second time ein schockt ein zweites mal in which a football match of november was reviewed again and it was hinted that the poor performance of some of the players was connected to the bettingscandal c the criminal proceedings on march at dg and ai filed a private prosecution privatanklage against the applicants before the feldkirch regional court they argued that the accusation raised in the article published by the applicant company in its newspaper on february that they had accepted bribes and manipulated football matches was particularly serious for a professional football player and his professional reputation this accusation which was untrue constituted defamation and they requested the court to convict the first and second applicants of this offence they indicated in particular the following passages of the article as defamatoryi terrible suspicion against footballpros confirmed bregenz players bribed with eur schlimmer vedacht gegen fussball profis erhärtet bregenz spieler mit bestochenii sold and betrayed the team for eur für team verkauft und verrateniii bregenz players at dg and ai were bribed eur for their team to lose three matches die bregenz spieler at dg und ai sollen bestochen worden sein damit ihr team drei spiele verliertiv regarding the third plaintiff at at had made contact with the croatian bettingmafia den kontakt zur kroatischen wettmafia soll at hergestellt haben they also claimed compensation from the applicant company for the harm caused and requested that the judgment be published in its newspaper on march the feldkirch regional court ordered the applicant company to publish within five days a short piece kurze mitteilung on the institution of criminal proceedings for defamation in respect of the article at issue on april the applicants commented on the charges against them they argued that they had only voiced a suspicion against the plaintiffs but that in any event their statements were true or at least the first and second applicants had had good reason to believe that they were true which would rule out punishment between april and december the regional court held four hearings in the case in which it heard several witnesses inter alia ke a freelance journalist working for the third applicants newspaper and who had contacted two informants who had wished to remain anonymous and rh see above rh spoke about his contacts with the s brothers since may and stated that one of them fs had contacts in austria in particular the football club casino sw bregenz in his opinion two players of that team were in contact with fs but he did not give any names or other details on december the regional court found that the incriminated statements from the article of february amounted to defamation convicted the first and second applicants of that offence and sentenced them to a fine of eur and eur respectively suspended on probation for a probationary period of three years it ordered the applicant company to pay compensation of eur to each plaintiff and to publish an extract of the present judgment in its newspaper as regards the impugned article the regional court paid particular attention to its visual appearance which through its layout and presentation in particular the printing in white in a large black box conveyed to the reader the impression that the investigators were about to catch the pictured persons who had filled their pockets with money by using dirty tricks that first impression was not mitigated by the small reference to a suspicion in the upper left corner the same was true for the headline on page which read sold and betrayed the team for eur this was a leading question which already contained the answer and again that first impression could hardly be mitigated by the use of the subjunctive in some phrases of the article itself the court therefore concluded that seen as a whole the article created the impression of being a statement of facts about the scandal and not a genuine expression of a suspicion the regional court therefore examined whether the accused had acted with due journalistic diligence when they considered these statements as true or if they could prove their veracity as regards the first element the regional court accepted that there was a public interest in being informed on the question of whether or not players of the casino sw bregenz team had actually been involved in a betting scandal but found that the first and second applicants had not acted with sufficient professional diligence they had not personally conducted any research to verify the wellfoundedness of the rumours but had merely relied on the research of ke a freelance collaborator with the newspaper and had not checked the reliability of the sources anonymous informants not known to them furthermore they had not given at dg and ai an opportunity to react even though there had been important new elements going beyond a general suspicion of involvement in the betting scandal to which they had already reacted in the past namely that they had received a specific amount eur for manipulating three football matches in the summer of turning to the proof of truth put forward by the applicants the regional court observed that dg and ai had only been accused by kes two informants x and y of being involved in the betting scandal and these informants had not given any details nor stated that they themselves had witnessed a transaction also rh when heard by the court did not refer to them directly or indirectly there was clearly no proof of the truth as regards at the regional court observed that he had lied when he stated that he did not know fs that fs had repeatedly visited bregenz and that there had been football matches in which that player had given a very poor performance also the informants x and y had stated that at was involved in the betting scandal these were arguments speaking in favour of his involvement in the betting scandal but there were also arguments speaking against it was understandable that at had not admitted to knowing fs immediately when all kinds of suspicions were discussed in connection with the betting scandal as fs was one of the principal persons involved in that scandal furthermore there was only evidence that fs had visited bregenz on various occasions between autumn and may whereas the football match which in the eyes of the authors of the article was particularly suspicious had taken place in november according to the information given by x and y fs had paid the three accused football players eur in summer for three matches which had not yet taken place that did not coincide with his habits as described in detail by rh lastly the amount claimed by x and y namely eur was not plausible given that casino sw bregenz had been at the very end of the national football league table in austria throughout the season of and the quota for bets on that team losing a match would have been so small that it would not have justified the investment of a considerable sum weighing all these elements the regional court concluded that the applicants had not succeeded in proving the truth of the statements made in the impugned article as regards the compensation under section of the media act the regional court found that the particular seriousness of the accusations raised and the adverse effect they could have on the career of a professional footballer justified the sum of compensation granted on january the applicants appealed against this judgment they argued that the impugned article did not contain a statement of fact but merely a suspicion against at dg and ai moreover the first and second applicants had fully complied with journalistic ethics as ke and the applicants had acted as a team there was no need to check further the information received and at that stage of the investigations there had also been no need to give the plaintiffs an opportunity to react to the information to be published on april the innsbruck court of appeal dismissed the appeal of the first and second applicants but partially granted the appeal of the applicant company and reduced the amount of compensation to eur for each plaintiff it found that the regional court had carefully weighed the arguments and had arrived at a correct and wellreasoned judgment it agreed with the regional court that the first and second applicants had not reported on a mere suspicion but had presented their allegations as facts which they had failed to prove ii relevant domestic law if a publication in the media viewed objectively constitutes defamation under section of the criminal code or an insult under section of the criminal code the insulted person may claim nonpecuniary damages against the media owner pursuant to section of the media act section of the criminal code in so far as relevant reads as follows as it may be perceived by a third party anyone who makes an accusation against another of having a contemptible character or attitude or of behaving contrary to honour or morality and of such a nature as to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six months or a fine anyone who commits this offence in a printed document by broadcasting or otherwise in such a way as to make the defamation accessible to a broad section of the public shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine the person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true as regards the offence defined in paragraph he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to assume that the statement was true section of the media act in force at the time of the events read as follows if in a medium the presence of the factual elements of the offences of defamation is established the person concerned has against the owner of the medium a claim for compensation of the prejudice suffered the,,,
31,the applicants are journalists at the relevant time they were employed by one of the two national television stations in denmark danmarks radio hereafter dr the first applicant produced a television programme described as a documentary called when the doctor knows best which was broadcast at pm on september and seen by viewers the second applicant was the first applicants superior and responsible for the content of the programme the television programme concerned the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer notably at copenhagen university hospital rigshospitalet where consultant s was in charge of treatment it focused on two types of chemotherapy medication alimta produced by l and vinorelbine produced by f copenhagen university hospital and s used vinorelbine as firstline treatment in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin depending on whether the treatment was related to an operation operable patients or to prolonging life and relieving pain and symptoms inoperable patients three experts participated in the programme a medical doctor from karolinska hospital in sweden a professor from switzerland and a medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany they all used alimta as firstline treatment most often in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin the programme followed four patients and their relatives who told their stories and a narrator spoke as a voiceover throughout the programme in preparation for the programme the first applicant had carried out research on the subject which included inter alia the following on september the european union had approved the marketing of alimta in combination with cisplatin for treatment of patients with inoperable pleural mesothelioma cancer the background for the approval was among others research which had been carried out examining the effect of treatment with alimta in combination with cisplatin as compared to treatment with cisplatin alone a phase iii trial see paragraph below as firstline therapy in july the minister for internal affairs and health replied to various questions posed by members of parliament as to the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer in denmark the minister replied inter alia that there was no proof that an alimtabased treatment was more efficient than other chemotherapybased treatments including that offered in denmark that the combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin which was used at copenhagen university hospital resulted in a oneyear survival rate of and a median lifetime of months which was exactly the survival rate from using the combination of alimta and cisplatin but that there had been no direct comparison of the two treatments and that there was no internationally accepted standard chemotherapy for the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer but that several single and combined treatments were used on june copenhagen university hospital produced a memorandum about pleural mesothelioma cancer and its treatment which was sent to dr it stressed that international studies including of vinorelbine and alimta had not shown that any twocombination regime was superior to other twocombination regimes that information was confirmed by the professor from switzerland in an email of june and by the medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany in an email of june the memorandum also referred to a fund aimed at developing research on pleural mesothelioma cancer in the amount of danish kroner dkk equal to approximately euros eur received by s from company f which produces vinorelbine the money had been used to pay nurses and students and for data collection it emerged that there had been no financial profit for the doctors involved having received the abovementioned memorandum the first applicant again contacted the professor from switzerland and the medical doctor at grosshandorf hospital in germany in essence they confirmed in subsequent emails of and july that since there had been no direct comparative clinical studies there was no scientific evidence that one twocombination regime was superior to another twocombination regime medical research studies involving human subjects are called clinical trials they are divided into different stages called phases generally it can be said that the earliest phase trials may look at whether a drug is safe or at its sideeffects a later phase ii trial aims to find out whether the treatment works well enough for which types of cancer the treatment works more about side effects and how to manage them and more about the best dose to use a later phase iii trial aims to test whether a new treatment is better than existing treatments standard treatment these trials may compare a completely new treatment with the standard treatment or with different doses or ways of giving a standard treatment a the proceedings before the courts subsequent to the broadcast on september of the television programme on october copenhagen university hospital and s instituted defamation proceedings before the copenhagen city court københavns byret against the director of dr and the two applicants maintaining that the latter in the programme in question had made direct and indirect accusations covered by article of the penal code straffeloven against copenhagen university hospital and s of malpractice regarding certain patients suffering from pleural mesothelioma cancer allegedly resulting in the patients unnecessary death and shortening of life in the interest of ss professional prestige and private finances before the city court the applicants s and medical director h for copenhagen university hospital gave evidence the first applicant stated inter alia that she had not criticised copenhagen university hospital for improper treatment causing death her message was only to point out that the substance of alimta had been better documented than the substance of vinorelbine she had collected statements from patients and experts but could not state herself whether alimta was a better product than vinorelbine the experts had not stated whether alimta in combination with another product was better than vinorelbine in combination with another product however all experts had emphasised that alimta had been evaluated in a phase iii trial for which reason it was a more thoroughly tested product her questions had been answered during her conversations with professor m on october and s on october subsequently no one had been willing to answer her questions that was the only real conversation she had had with s the next time she had called him he had put down the receiver when it had not been possible for her to get any response to her many points of criticism she had contacted h she had wanted statements from both h and s as the programme would be unbalanced if they were not heard some found that alimta had been better documented than vinorelbine she was not aware of any trial demonstrating that a combination with alimta was better than a combination with another medicinal product s stated inter alia the following alimta has been used for secondline therapy in denmark since and since as firstline therapy patients had been given the impression in the media that alimta was a miracle cure therefore copenhagen university hospital had introduced it as an option today alimta is used in combination with carboplatin as the standard therapy for inoperable patients sometimes in autumn the standard therapy for operable patients had been changed to cisplatin in combination with alimta if some patients were offered alimta everybody had to be offered alimta after the programme had been broadcast patients started mistrusting the vinorelbine therapy afterwards it was not possible to perform the trial phase ii on this drug nor would it be possible to obtain funding for the trial therefore no trial had been performed of vinorelbine he had provided the information included in professor ms memorandum of september he had talked to the first applicant several times and had spent a lot of time and energy on explaining cancer therapy he had also lost confidence in the first applicant h stated among other things the approval of alimta by the danish medicines agency for the treatment of mesothelioma only means that a marketing authorisation has been granted for the drug which means that advertisement of the product is permitted vinorelbine has also been approved by the danish medicines agency but for a wide range of oncological therapies in when alimta was tested phase iii the bar had been set quite low the study compared alimta with a clearly inferior treatment that would not actually be offered to anybody it would have been more relevant to study alimta in combination with cisplatin versus vinorelbine with cisplatin s has made a phase ii trial of the standard therapy vinorelbine subsequently the standard therapy regimen has been expanded to include alimta which is not a better product than vinorelbine but eight times more expensive if two drugs are equally effective but one of them is eight times more expensive than the other patients will be offered therapy using the cheaper drug the standard therapies now offered by copenhagen university hospital are vinorelbine in combination with cisplatin for inoperable patients and alimta in combination with cisplatin for operable patients the shift to alimta as the standard therapy at copenhagen university hospital did not reflect that alimta was medically better the applicants programme had had a large impact as patients were asking not to be treated with vinorelbine copenhagen university hospital had therefore had to change medical products because patients had the clear impression that vinorelbine was not as good as alimta it is quite usual for copenhagen university hospital to surrender material to the press and to answer questions but the questions of the first applicant were neverending copenhagen university hospital has spent about a manyear or about dkk responding to inquiries from the first applicant and huge efforts had been made to accommodate her requests the programme had created distrust towards both copenhagen university hospital and s and had created uncertainty in both patients and relatives he had received to hate mails himself by a judgment of april the copenhagen city court found against the applicants and the director of dr and sentenced them each to dayfines of danish kroner dkk the allegations were declared null and void the reasoning was as follows based on the evidence the city court accepts as a fact that in following a phase iii trial emea approved alimta in combination with cisplatin for treating patients suffering from inoperable malignant pleural mesothelioma and that subsequently the same was approved by the danish medicines agency the court also accept as a fact that vinorelbine is a drug dating back more than years whose effect had been documented by clinical experience and approved by the danish medicines agency for a wide range of oncological therapies finally the court also accepts as a fact that it has not been documented that alimta therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product is more effective than vinorelbine therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product as regards the term experimental drug the court accepts as a fact that a drug administered to patients in a trial is referred to as an experimental drug no matter whether the same drug is the standard therapy offered outside the trial setting no matter that the applicants are deemed to have been aware of the above circumstances following their comprehensive research of the matter it was said in the programme that for dying patients s and copenhagen university hospital had prescribed a nonapproved chemotherapy regimen not approved for the diagnosis or which was not the correct chemotherapy and that s and copenhagen university hospital used an experimental drug the worstcase scenario being that patients would die earlier than if they had been treated with an approved substance or that it would have fatal consequences moreover the phrase the only drug with a known effect was used since no account was given in the programme of the abovementioned trials and approval process and the terminology applied for that process the court finds that it would seem to a nonprofessional viewer that alimta was the only effective drug for mesothelioma particularly because the programme linked the treatment of two patients with vinorelbine to their death whereas the prospect of several more years to live was held out to the one patient who had been given alimta therapy in germany moreover the programme also linked ss use of vinorelbine to his personal esteem and his personal research account although the applicants had been made aware of the research grant management procedure though professor ms memorandum of september before the broadcast since no account was given either of the procedure for managing research grants the court also finds in this respect that it would seem to a nonprofessional viewer that s had a personal financial interest in starting vinorelbine treatment rather than alimta the applicants are therefore considered to have violated article of the penal code according to the information on the applicants knowledge after their comprehensive research of the matter the court finds no basis for exempting them from punishment or remitting the penalty under article of the penal code compare also article of the convention the applicants are furthermore jointly and severally liable for paying legal costs of dkk on appeal on june the judgment was upheld by the high court of eastern denmark østre landsret with the following reasoning in the introduction to the programme when the doctor knows best a narrator states among other things a danish doctor is entering a medical congress to show his research results for years he has gone his own way he has treated dying patients with chemotherapy that is not approved later during the programme it is stated at which hospitals one can receive treatment for pleural mesothelioma cancer that these hospitals cooperate with copenhagen university hospital and a reference is made to a named consultant s head of the scandinavian centre for treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer during the various interviews a narrator states inter alia the doctor does not give his patients the only approved medication instead he uses a test medication in the worst scenario that may result in the patients dying earlier than if they had been given the approved substance there is only one approved chemotherapy against pleural mesothelioma cancer but that is not offered to sp one of the patients followed in the programme the doctors chose to treat her with a substance that is not approved for the diagnosis and whose effect on pleural mesothelioma cancer is not substantiated however that chemotherapy turned out to have huge consequences for her sp s can freely choose the medication that he thinks is best there is only one treatment which in comparative studies has proved to have an effect on pleural mesothelioma cancer accordingly that is the only medication which is approved as treatment that medication is called alimta however s chose not to use that medication on his patients thus it has not been proved whether vinorelbine works according to the calculations made by dr close to patients in denmark have been given test medication in the worst scenario that may result in patients dying earlier than if they had been given the approved medication for her sp the lack of effect of treatment by vinorelbine turns out to have had fatal consequences the family k ask themselves why s goes his own way they suspect that he has other interests than those of the patients that suspicion grows when they talk to sks personal doctor it turns out however that s may also have had other reasons for choosing vinorelbine because he has used this medication in medical tests on the patients in a phase when they are fighting for their lives the question remains why does s carry out tests with vinorelbine could it have something to do with the prestige which is implicit in having research articles published we do not know whether it is prestige that impels s thus s will not acknowledge what leading experts agree on namely that alimta is the only medication whose effect is substantiated here it turns out that s has received more than dkk over the last five and a half years from the company f that is the company behind the test medication vinorelbine the money has been paid into ss personal research account dkk is earmarked for the tests s withheld that information the programme ends by informing us among other things that two of the patients who were interviewed have passed away the narrator says inter alia tj who was part of ss tests with vinorelbine died on january with these statements the applicants not only passed on assertions by patients relatives and experts but also took a stand so that the programme undisputedly gave the viewers the impression that malpractice has occurred at copenhagen university hospital in that s has deliberately used medication vinorelbine which is not approved for treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer and whose effect has not been substantiated that the medication in question was part of a test and that the test medication has resulted in patients dying or having their lives shortened the way that the programme is built up with its beginning and ending the viewers get the clear impression that the reasons behind this choice of medication vinorelbine were ss professional prestige and personal finances against this background in the programme the applicants as producer of the programme and as chief subeditor have made an allegation against copenhagen university hospital and s of malpractice and of nourishing irrelevant considerations to the detriment of the lives and health of patients such an accusation is likely to disparage copenhagen university hospital and s in the eyes of their fellow citizens as set out in article of the penal code it must have been clear to them the applicants that they were making such an allegation by way of their presentation of the programme the applicants have not attempted to establish the truth of the allegation but have submitted that the allegation shall be unpunishable by virtue of article of the penal code as they acted in lawful protection of an obvious public interest or the interest of others or in the alternative that punishment should be remitted under article of the penal code because they were justified in regarding the allegations as true these provisions must in connection with article of the penal code be understood in the light of article of the convention on the protection of freedom of expression a very considerable public interest is related to journalistic discussion about risk to life and health or suspicion thereof as regards public hospital treatment when balancing considerations of freedom of expression with considerations of the protection of the name and reputation of persons and companies the former is accorded tremendous weight on the scale that entails acknowledgement of a very farreaching freedom of expression for the press and accordingly the press must be permitted as the public control and information organ public watchdog a certain amount of exaggeration and provocation in connection with their discussion of these questions when factually there are reasons for expressing criticism on the basis of the information in the case including the research material that the applicants possessed before the broadcast of the programme in particular the emails from the medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany and the professor from switzerland the replies by the minister for internal affairs and health to various questions posed by members of parliament and the memorandum of june produced by copenhagen university hospital about pleural mesothelioma cancer it can be established that vinorelbine in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin was standard treatment at copenhagen university hospital that the european union on september approved the marketing of alimta in connection with cisplatin for treatment of inoperable patients with pleural mesothelioma cancer that there was no substantiation or basis for believing that an alimtabased treatment was more efficient than the treatment offered by copenhagen university hospital that some patients at copenhagen university hospital who were already about to receive vinorelbine as standard treatment were chosen and offered the same medicine as part of a test it is not known for what and that s did not make any private financial profit from these tests against this background including the fact that the word approved was not explained during the programme namely the difference between medication approved for treatment and medication approved for marketing and by consistently using the word test medication even though only one patient in the programme participated in tests the applicants made allegations which were based on an incorrect factual basis of which they must have been aware via the research material the aim of the programme to make a critical assessment of the treatment of patients with pleural mesothelioma cancer offered by copenhagen university hospital and the responsible consultant is a legitimate part of the presss role as public watchdog but it can not justify an allegation which is built on a factually incorrect basis and thus a wrong premise the applicants who did not limit themselves to referring to or disseminating statements by experts patients and relatives did not have any basis for making such serious allegations against copenhagen university hospital and s the allegations can not be justified on the grounds that copenhagen university hospital and s refused to participate in the programme against this background and since in relation to article there is no interest to protect when there is no factual basis for the accusations the allegations are not unpunishable under article nor is there any basis for remitting the punishment under article of the penal code it is an aggravating factor that the wrongful accusations were disseminated on national television during primetime and on drs homepage by means of which the accusations had a significant spread accordingly the high court agrees with the copenhagen city courts judgment that the applicants be fined under article and that the allegations be declared null and void by virtue of article the high court thus dismisses the appeal and upholds the judgment of the copenhagen city court the applicants shall be jointly and severally liable for paying legal costs of the high court appeal to copenhagen university hospital and s in the amount of dkk which constitutes the legal fee inclusive of vat in fixing the amount the high court took into account the scope and duration of the case on october the appeals permission board procesbevillingsnævnet refused the applicants request for leave to appeal to the supreme court højesteret b complaints lodged with the patient insurance association subsequent to the broadcast on september of the television programme four complaints were lodged with the patient insurance association patientforsikringen relating to the issues raised by the programme a press release published on the associations website on march read as follows as of today the patient insurance association has received four complaints relating to the treatment of mesothelioma patients with combinatorial drugs other than carboplatin and alimta that treatment was questioned by the danish broadcasting corporation dr in a documentary programme in september the patient insurance association has received four complaints relating to the criticism raised this means that the persons claiming compensation are either patients or their dependants one of the reasons being their belief that the combinatorial drugs administered to treat the disease were incorrect ones all four complaints have been refused one of the reasons being that the independent medical oncologists who assessed the cases found that it was in compliance with optimum medical standards to treat patients with the selected combination therapy two of the cases have been appealed against to the national agency for patients rights and complaints patientskadeankenævnet the national agency for patients rights and complaints upheld the decision of the patient insurance association finding inter alia patients were offered carboplatin and vinorelbine which must be considered to be as active as other combinations with a favourable profile of adverse reactions the other appeal does not concern the issue of combination therapy ii relevant domestic law the relevant provisions of the danish penal code applicable at the time read as follows article any person who tarnishes the honour of another by offensive words or conduct or by making or spreading allegations of an act likely to disparage him in the eyes of his fellow citizens shall be liable to a fine or to imprisonment not exceeding four months article if an allegation has been maliciously made or disseminated or if the author has no reasonable ground to regard it as true he shall be guilty of defamation and the punishment mentioned in article may increase to a term not exceeding two years article an allegation shall not be punishable if its truth has been established or if the author of the allegation has in good faith been under an obligation to speak or has acted in lawful protection of an obvious public interest or of the personal interest of himself or of others the punishment may be remitted where evidence is produced which justifies the grounds for regarding the allegations as true article the penalty prescribed in article of the penal code may be remitted if the act has been provoked by improper behaviour on the part of the injured person or if he is guilty of retaliation article if a defamatory allegation is unjustified a statement to that effect shall at the request of the injured party be included in the sentence any person convicted of defamation may be ordered at the request of the insulted person to pay to the insulted person an amount fixed by the court to cover the costs of promulgating the judgment conclusion alone or also the grounds in one or more official gazettes this also applies even if the judgment only provides for retraction under the provision of subsection the,,,
32,the first applicant franz olivier giesbert is the publication director of the magazine le point the second applicant hervé gattegno is a journalist with le point the third applicant is the company operating le point a background to the proceedings at issue the proceedings against the applicants which form the subject matter of the three applications are related to the events commonly referred to as the bettencourt affair mrs liliane bettencourt principal shareholder of the group loréal is one of the richest individuals in france from the late s she made numerous gifts to her friend b a writer and photographer totalling several hundred million euros in value in december mrs bettencourts daughter ms bettencourt meyers filed a criminal complaint against b for the offence of undue influence abus de faiblesse with the public prosecutor at the nanterre tribunal de grande instance a preliminary investigation was opened in that context numerous interviews were conducted in particular with individuals close to mrs bettencourt and searches were carried out in september b was taken into police custody without waiting for the outcome of the investigation ms bettencourt meyers brought a private prosecution against b in the nanterre criminal court on the same charge of undue influence she sought and obtained the inclusion in the case file of material and reports from the preliminary investigation in september the public prosecutors office decided to discontinue the proceedings based on ms bettencourt meyers original complaint the case initiated by the private prosecution was first set down for hearing on september then on december on that date it was decided to seek a medical assessment of mrs bettencourt and the hearing was deferred again to april for the subsequent criminal proceedings see paragraphs and below mrs bettencourt publicly announced that she was refusing to undergo the assessment ordered by the court she also filed submissions by way of voluntary intervention including in the alternative an application to join the proceedings as a civil party in the event that the prosecution was regarded as valid by the court she argued that the aim of her civilparty application was to persuade the court that her mental faculties were not diminished and that she had made her gifts to b with all due lucidity the developments in the case were widely reported in the press the offending articles in le point were thus published in that context b the offending articles the article of december on december the third applicant published with the second applicants byline a fourpage spread under the heading investigation into a very dear friend and with the subheading treasure did he take advantage of liliane bettencourt b denies it but the finger of suspicion points to him the article referred to various aspects of the case and in particular the very significant gifts made by the heir of loréal for a total of one billion euros to b the journalist wrote quoting the testimony of liliane bettencourts former accountant she too describes the psychological domination imposed on an elderly lady who is more fragile than she may like he also inserted a passage from the prosecution document which summed up the situation as follows taking advantage of his influence and liliane bettencourts weakness b persuaded her at a time when her health was declining to give him sums of money and assets going beyond tokens of friendship the article was full of comments between inverted commas presented as extracts from statements made to the investigators working under the public prosecutor it pointed out that the latter had discontinued the investigation in question among the quotations were explanations given by b when he was in police custody in september and it was claimed by the journalist that those explanations were often contradicted by the facts he swears that liliane bettencourt has acted towards him like a patron their first meeting goes back to the s but their friendship dates from a portrait he made of her in i was then sufficiently well off that i did not need financial assistance from mrs bettencourt he retorted to the investigators i already owned five apartments on rue servandoni paris th a large collection of paintings and had coownership of the brouzet estate a large estate in the gard together with copyright dues and a commission on the sale by dior of the perfume poison after verification this inventory seems to be somewhat overstated in actual fact it was through a series of cheques from the billionaire and the cancellation of astronomical debts to real estate companies owned by him that b has managed to build up his assets to the point of acquiring seven apartments in the welltodo neighbourhood of saint sulpice today the whole complex forms a quaint townhouse with swimming pool cctv cameras and secret passages between the bookshelves contradicted by the numbers and dates the photographer was forced to explain more humbly that mrs bettencourt wanted him to expand in order to install all his works and perhaps set up a museum but curiously his benefactor did not even mention such a project during her own hearing on may bs explanation she is a modest woman she will not say the things that are in the depth of her heart the police investigation also demonstrates the lavishness of his property in the gard mrs bettencourt did not contribute to its financing he claimed however the billionaires accountant testified that numerous cheques had been signed by her made out to contractors doing work on the estate for at least euros and as much as a cheque of million euros in december several employees testified that around the same time the old ladys health had deteriorated herein lies the gravamen of the whole case was the loréal heiress really aware of the extent of her generosity b declared that he had never seen the slightest impairment of her behaviour he even went as far as attributing to the octogenarian on record a remarkable intellectual agility moreover he willingly gave the police officer the names of other beneficiaries who had received lavish gifts but perhaps not for the same reasons he nevertheless conceded the rest of his defence is even more audacious if he is to be believed liliane bettencourt enriched him against his will insisting that he accept gifts which he tried to refuse i only knew about these gifts when signing for them at the notarys office he claimed in relation to the paintings she has given him when asked by the police whether the notary had expressed any reservation he replied no on the contrary the notary told me that the money came from mrs bettencourts income and that she was responsible enough to be in control of what she was doing here again the reality is rather less clear the notary in question was originally introduced to liliane bettencourt to deal with the photographers real estate acquisitions then he replaced the family notary and all documents relating to life insurance were transferred to his practice i no longer recall whether i knew him before he worked for mrs bettencourt said b in an embarrassed semiconfession several employees say he was behind her choice his protests that he was disinterested are also at odds with a number of findings especially this answer liliane bettencourt gave herself to the police asked if her protégé had ever refused her generosity she replied no when the investigators confronted him with this answer the photographer was forced to concede i have never refused gifts that have already been recorded in notarial acts thats a bit different in addition to these oddities there are two damning statements in the file those two statements are extracts from the testimony of the former director of loréal once responsible for the management of liliane bettencourts assets and her former accountant the first spoke of a hold over mrs bettencourt he had asked to be relieved of his duties because he testified i ran the risk of being complicit in the misdeeds of mr b by my tacit consent the second witness referred to pressure on the part of the photographer and testified that he was always asking for money in late her attention was drawn to the proposed assignment of a life insurance policy for an amount in excess of million euros i tried to reason with mrs bettencourt but she was no longer her old self recalled the accountant i then bumped into b in the house and said to him youve seen the state she is in you know she is very ill he replied never mind as long as she is not under deputyship she can still sign the article also contained comments made by mrs bettencourt on may in a box headed exclusive what liliane bettencourt told the police the journalist after quoting extracts from the statement showing that mrs bettencourt did not recall the agreements she had signed with b wrote that these memory lapses are clearly at odds with the picture that b would be painting of her to the same investigators in another box the journalist reported on the application for judicial protection filed by mrs bettencourts daughter and quoted an extract from the report of neurologist pa who had been asked by the public prosecutor to examine the billionaires medical records revealing a state of vulnerability related to a probable degenerative neurological condition which impaired her individual faculties the article stated that from this episode and many others the financial brigade investigators in a report of december had concluded that there was a series of sufficiently strong presumptions that the offence of undue influence had been committed by b and that the photographer for his part had denounced an odious attack on a worldfamous artist it ended thus the court will rule whether the fortune passed to him by liliane bettencourt was a windfall or a swindle either way its a masterstroke the article of february on february the third applicant published with the second applicants byline an article indicated on the full front cover of the magazine under the headline bettencourt affair how to gain one billion without any effort the subheadings announcing the article read the unbelievable story of a society photographer who made a fortune by seducing liliane bettencourt the richest woman in france and the accusations of madams employees a photomontage showing mrs bettencourt with her friend b also appeared on the cover the subject of the article which extended to eight pages was indicated as follows bettencourt affair has the richest woman in france been conned by the photographer b some of her former employees have said as much to the police le point reveals their testimony and the secrets of this incredible highsociety melodrama the article began as follows is it about money or sentiment a quarrel over an inheritance or a question of principle a settling of family scores or the most perfect scam all of these things put together perhaps and much more because the millions slip away by their hundreds in an atmosphere redolent of an agatha christie novel and a setting worthy of scott fitzgerald even the trial the inevitable epilogue will resemble a highsociety event on and april the court of nanterre will look into the incredible generosity for almost a decade of the richest woman in france towards the person she has made her favourite the photographer b the article continued as follows since the billionaires daughter has taken her case to the courts accusing her mothers protégé of the offence of undue influence ripples of disgust have been felt along the majestic avenues of neuilly and beyond the high society of paris in finance industry and politics concerned that it may one day be regretted that no one had seen anything or at least said anything for the investigation has revealed the existence of lavish gifts apparently totalling around billion euros could such riches pass unnoticed theres a disturbing detail the largest sums were assigned to b in the spring of and in the summer of at a time when liliane bettencourts health was declining sharply guru much testimony has come to light since then le point is exclusively publishing several extracts see the following pages housemaids nurses secretaries the chauffeur accountants all describe the hold that b had over the loreal heiress aged his own individual way of soliciting her generosity the equivocal aspects of his behaviour before the court the succession of these indignant employees will be reminiscent of the spectacle in the von bülow affair the trial of the libertine and cynical american aristocrat who was accused in the early s on rhode island of poisoning his wife so that he could take over her fortune but even that scenario would not be the worst for b convicted at first instance von bülow was nevertheless acquitted on appeal for the time being the photographer confronts the suspicions with sardonic contempt to make a work of ones life thats what matters he proclaimed in le monde describing the charges against him as pathetic rumours his benefactor an intelligent woman who knows how to choose men to take risks he told the police sweeping a little too quickly under the carpet the doubts about her state of health to be sure the heiress affirmed a year ago in le journal du dimanche that she was attached to b and that she had no time for gossip she has since shut herself away leaving her lawyers to speak in her place refusing any medical assessment and cutting short her appearances at receptions or ceremonies this silence has only served to reinforce the impression of a woman under influence in the middle of the article under the heading exclusive the women who accuse there were long extracts over three pages from statements of employees who worked at mrs bettencourts house accountant secretary chambermaid nurse that had been given during the preliminary investigation the following statements were highlighted in particular it was as if b had woven his web around mrs bettencourt he answered me as long as she is not under deputyship she can sign b takes advantage of madames weakness to benefit from her generosity after referring to remarks by b and by mrs bettencourt in the press the article added a number of statements paint a less idyllic picture under oath employees and servants mentioned pressing requests for money going as far as harassment harsh language and various schemes bordering on the sordid under an intermediate heading strategy the article then mentioned and partially quoted documents that had been discovered by the financial investigators at bs home in paris the article ended with a small insert indicating that b had refused to respond to le point preferring to reserve his answers for the judges c the proceedings brought against the applicants following the publication of the impugned articles the urgent proceedings brought by mrs bettencourt application no on february following the publication of february mrs bettencourt brought urgent proceedings against the applicants in the paris tribunal de grande instance claiming a manifestly unlawful nuisance under articles and of the code of civil procedure she asked the urgentapplications judge to find that the reproduction of procedural documents from the file of the preliminary investigation initiated by the nanterre public prosecutor breached section of the law of july on freedom of the press section which prohibited the publication of documents from a criminal case file before they had been read out in open court and article of the civil code guaranteeing the right to respect for private life she requested that a courtordered notice be published in le point on pain of a coercive fine and that the applicants be ordered to pay her by way of an advance compensation for her nonpecuniary damage on account of her portrayal as an individual with diminished intellectual faculties who had been duped the applicants disputed mrs bettencourts standing to bring the proceedings as prosecution in respect of the section offence could only be initiated by the public prosecutor under section of the same law on the merits they claimed that it was contradictory on the one hand to require journalists to establish the veracity of the information that they published and on the other to penalise them for substantiating their investigation in a decision of march the vice president of the paris tribunal de grande instance found that mrs bettencourt had standing in so far as she was arguing that the publication of the impugned documents had on the basis of that provision caused her personal damage the judge indicated that while section of the law reserved the prosecution of the section offence for the public prosecutor an individual who claimed to have sustained pecuniary or nonpecuniary damage as a result of a publication was entitled to act as a civil party in the proceedings or to bring a case before the urgentapplications judge under article of the code of civil procedure in order to seek the requisite protective or remedial measures to put an end to the unlawful nuisance resulting from such publication or to request a sum by way of an advance the judge explained it suffices for the publication of the documents prior to their reading in open court to have caused the person actual and direct damage regardless whether or not the person is a party to the proceedings in which the documents are to be presented he ordered the applicants jointly to pay an advance of euros eur and the same sum in procedural expenses under article of the code of civil procedure as to the application of section of the act the judge took the view that the statements by employees of mrs bettencourt paragraph above constituted procedural documents which were part of the preliminary investigation and that even though it had been discontinued those documents had been joined to the criminal proceedings now pending after their transmission had been sought and obtained by ms bettencourt meyers in support of her own private prosecution he added that those statements all helped the case for the prosecution as indicated on the magazines cover the accusations of madames employees and observed as follows the publication of long passages emanating from insiders helps to give the reported facts an appearance of authenticity and objectivity that the article does not seek to nuance but on the contrary to reinforce the reader is thus led to regard those facts as proven because they are presented through the prism of a journalists analysis which is bound to contain a degree of subjectivity or opinion for those reasons the alleged breach of section can not be combined with the breaches under article of the civil code presumption of innocence or article of the civil code private life or section of the law of july defamation proceedings nor can it result in redress on the basis of those separate legal provisions the judge concluded that the publication was capable of infringing the rights of mrs bettencourt as it portrayed her at a time when the nanterre criminal court had not yet begun to examine the criminal cases as a woman who was manipulated and weak a description that she categorically denied the judge further found that the applicants were not justified in relying on the provisions of article of the convention and the necessities of information in this connection he indicated that section sought mainly to preserve the independence and orderly conduct of the judicial process in addition to protecting the rights of the persons concerned particularly by guaranteeing the presumption of innocence he emphasised the limited and temporary nature of the restriction on freedom of expression as the legislation did not prevent analysis of or comments on procedural material or the publication of information gleaned from the proceedings themselves but only prohibited the reproduction of documents which were intended for public disclosure in the context of a judicial process surrounded by safeguards these safeguards include respect for defence rights and the principle of adversarial proceedings which could not be ensured by a prior isolated and partial media report the judge went on to explain as follows the impugned restriction can not be compared to the case of disclosure of professional secrets or of secrets from the preliminary or judicial investigation on account of the possession by a journalist of documents covered by secrecy and used in publications imparting information to the general public in so far as the journalist who is not bound by those secrets is required to possess such documents in order to justify the veracity of the facts reported or the seriousness of his investigation but also to use them in compliance with the applicable legislation all of the claims submitted by mrs bettencourt alleging a breach of her privacy were dismissed on the ground that such a breach had not been sufficiently established having regard to the general publics right to be informed and interest in being informed of current affairs or events in the general interest the claimant has not relied on any specific breaches of her private life which would go beyond the information that it is permitted to mention in connection with the criminal case before the court of nanterre as le point did not in particular provide details about any health problems she may have the applicants appealed they argued in particular that the procedural documents in question which had been included in the case file solely on the initiative of the claimant and not on that of the public prosecutor could not be regarded as carrying the degree of authority which justified by derogation to the principle of freedom of expression the prohibition imposed by section they further emphasised that neither mrs bettencourts right to a fair hearing nor any undermining of the authority or impartiality of the courts was at stake in a judgment of march the paris court of appeal upheld the decision of the court below in the main and raised the amount of the advance to eur in addition to charging eur for the costs of the appeal proceedings it confirmed that the witness statements clearly constituted procedural documents even though the preliminary investigation had been discontinued since they had been transmitted by the public prosecutor at the request of the civil party and thus formed an integral part of the criminal proceedings in the courts view the fact that they were transmitted at the request of the civil party and not on the initiative of the public prosecutor bore little relevance in this connection it concluded that the publication of long passages from those statements constituted a violation of section and thus an unlawful nuisance within the meaning of article of the code of civil procedure it added as follows the requirement for the journalist to verify his sources and to compare the various material available to him on a given subject in the context of a serious investigation before imparting information to the public does not mean reproducing verbatim the documents used for his investigation where as in the present case such publication is prohibited under press legislation of which he can not be unaware the court concluded that the applicants submission that section should be declared incompatible with article of the convention was unfounded it took the view that mrs bettencourt was entitled to claim nonpecuniary damage as she had been portrayed asa woman in a weak mental state being easy to manipulate and under the influence of b which the reader is all the more likely to regard as the truth as the observations are presented as emanating from individuals who have played a particular role making them privileged observers of her private life lastly the court of appeal confirmed that there had been no breach of mrs bettencourts privacy in the following terms the mere mention of mrs bettencourts mental health in the body of the article without any details falling within her private sphere and in the testimony reproduced which was mainly about the conduct and manoeuvres attributed to b does not suffice to establish any particular breach of the respondents privacy that would go beyond the limits of legitimate information that the public is entitled to expect about a case which already being widely covered by the media is before the courts the applicants appealed on points of law in their grounds of appeal they argued under article of the convention that they had a duty to inform the public about a case pending before the courts which had been revived after a private prosecution following its discontinuance by the public prosecutor and which had given rise to wide media coverage especially on account of the personality and wealth of mrs bettencourt that the judgment of the court of appeal had found against them solely for publishing the statement extracts and not on account of their content that there had been no impairment of the interests protected by section because mrs bettencourt was not the defendant in the proceedings that there was a manifest contradiction in the court of appeals position as it had declared mrs bettencourts action admissible on the basis of the damage sustained while taking the view that she had not been portrayed as a weak and manipulated woman in terms of her right to respect for her private life in a judgment of april the court of cassation dismissed the applicants appeal and ordered them to pay mrs bettencourt the sum of eur in costs it gave the following reasons for its decision the judgment observes that long extracts were published from the statements taken during the preliminary investigation in which mrs bettencourt was portrayed as a manipulated and weak woman proceeding with a correct application of article of the convention the court of appeal was able without contradicting itself to conclude from that publication since the documents drawn up by the police during an investigation are procedural documents within the meaning of section of the law of july that mrs bettencourt was justified in claiming solely on the basis of that publication that she had sustained personal damage urgent proceedings brought by b application no on february b brought urgent proceedings against the applicants in the paris tribunal de grande instance following the publication of february arguing that it had caused him a manifestly unlawful nuisance infringing both his copyright to the photographs illustrating the article and his defence rights including his right to be presumed innocent in a decision of march the vice president of the paris tribunal de grande instance in addition to endorsing the reasoning already set out in paragraphs and above took the view that the impugned publication could have the alleged effects infringing bs right to a fair hearing and his right to the presumption of innocence bs claim concerning the infringement allegedly caused by the reproduction of photographs was rejected as falling outside the remit of the urgent proceedings judge the judge ordered the publication of a notice inside the magazine together with an indication of it on the cover to take up one half of the page in bold type under the heading judgment against le point in proceedings brought by b and on the weekly magazines website the applicants were also ordered jointly to pay b an advance of eur on compensation for his nonpecuniary damage together with an equivalent sum by way of procedural expenses the applicants appealed in a judgment of march the paris court of appeal upheld the decision appealed against mainly in the same terms as those set out in paragraph above it reiterated that the witness statements without engaging in any extensive interpretation of section could be characterised as procedural documents even though the investigation had been discontinued the fact that they were transmitted at the request of the private prosecutor and not on the initiative of the public prosecutor is of little relevance in this connection because they support the prosecution case it went on to find that consequently the mere publication of substantial extracts from those statements before they had been referred to or read out in open court had indeed constituted a violation of section of the law of july and therefore an unlawful nuisance the court of appeal further found as follows the four statements thus presented to the public portray b as a devious and unscrupulous individual using seduction manoeuvres and psychological pressure to persuade liliane bettencourt to grant him substantial and frequent gifts at a time when she was weak and when her husbands state of health had declined the reader is all the more likely to consider these statements to be true supporting as they do the accusation against b before the nanterre criminal court as they are presented as emanating from individuals who as a result of the services they rendered to her nurse chambermaid secretary played a particular role through which they became privileged observers of her private life the reader is thus led to believe in the accusation even before the court hearing the case has been able to reach its decision in conditions that breach the respondents right to be presumed innocent and his defence rights the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law in a judgment of july the court of cassation dismissed their appeal in the same terms as those of its judgment of april see paragraph above proceedings on the merits brought by b application no on march b brought proceedings against the applicants on the merits before the paris tribunal de grande instance seeking redress for the damage sustained on account of the publication of the articles of december and february in breach of section of the act in a judgment of june that court dismissed all of bs claims on the admissibility of his suit it observed that the applicants were correct to assert that an individual who claimed to be the victim of the offence provided for under section of the act was not authorised to bring a private prosecution on that basis it pointed out that by contrast the provisions of that act did not preclude the injured party from bringing proceedings in the civil courts as only one section of that act section prohibited the bringing of civil proceedings separately from a public prosecution namely in cases of defamation against public authorities state institutions and civil servants after observing that section usefully contributed to preserving the orderly functioning and impartiality of the justice system and to guarantee due process since the full and verbatim publication of documents from a criminal file before the trial could hinder the conduct of pending investigations or influence individuals who might subsequently be called upon to testify or even lay magistrates who might have to adjudicate upon the case the court gave the following reasons for its decision the prohibition that it establishes must not however restrict the ability of journalists to report on criminal cases even those which have not yet been publicly examined by a court and specifically those which raising issues of general interest involving significant interests or concerning people with highlevel responsibilities especially in political economic or artistic fields particularly deserve to be brought to public attention the application of this legislation can not in particular have the effect of precluding journalists from imparting to their readers in such a case all or part of the documentary resources from which they derived their information in order to establish its credibility or which substantiate their commentary and analysis in order to submit them for open discussion this is the case here extracts from reports which have been drawn up by the police acting on the instructions of the public prosecutor and which have been appended after the discontinuance of the proceedings for which they were produced to the file of further proceedings brought directly by a civil party in a criminal court those extracts therefore were included by the second applicant in two successive articles which were each the result of a journalistic investigation and sought to present readers with information analysis and comments on a criminal case that would soon be adjudicated upon by a court that involved considerable financial interests and concerned one of the richest individuals in france and a photographer and writer who has as he himself boasts undeniable success and notoriety in the first of the impugned texts short quotations from procedural documents which are reproduced in quotation marks in the body of the article and are therefore fully integrated into the journalists writing mention certain facts and offer an analysis thereof in the second text the three pages of extracts from procedural documents are included in a broader editorial presentation consisting essentially of a fourpage spread and a large photograph of the person concerned from which they are indissociable the journalist expressly refers to those extracts in his article analysing them and basing his conclusions on them if one were to accept in those circumstances that these two bodies of text should be examined by this court only on the basis of the strictliability offence under section of the freedom of the press act that would lead as the respondents rightly argue to preventing them from initiating the debate that is warranted by the journalists work within which the impugned extracts are merely one element and they would be deprived in the present case of the defences made available by law to persons who are prosecuted for defamation or for a breach of the right to be presumed innocent in other words precluding them from proving the veracity of the allegations or at least the journalists good faith and from submitting argument to the effect that the impugned texts do not contain any final conclusions expressing a biased view that the person in question is definitely guilty it should be noted in this connection that the claimant directs his main criticism in his writ of summons against the comments and analyses that the journalist has been led to write under his own name by the procedural documents cited and that he mainly reproduces in that writ only those comments and not the quotations that he is supposed to be challenging it should be observed in particular that the claimant complains that the statements from which extracts were quoted or in reality the journalists analysis thereof breached his right to be presumed innocent and were presented as damning and particularly incriminating it can be concluded that b himself admits that absent his chosen basis of action he had other options at his disposal a private prosecution or civil proceedings for defamation or a civil action for a breach of his right to be presumed innocent both of those courses of action would have entailed fair proceedings ensuring respect for the equality of arms and he was not therefore deprived of his right to have access to a court in order to secure respect for his rights in those circumstances the upholding in the present case of the claims that he has submitted under would constitute a restriction of freedom of expression devoid of any necessity in a democratic society in a judgment of february the paris court of appeal overturned that judgment it found that the impugned publications infringed bs right to a fair trial with respect for his defence rights including the right to be presumed innocent and breached section of the act it ordered the applicants jointly to pay b the sum of eur for each publication by way of compensation and eur in expenses under article of the code of civil procedure it also ordered the publication on pain of a coercive fine of a notice containing the operative provisions of the judgment in le point and on the magazines website the court of appeal explained that the assessment of the offending publication clearly went beyond the framework of that of socalled procedural offences and that it would have to be carried out with regard to article of the convention and to the question whether the interference with the applicants freedom of expression was necessary to protect the reputation or rights of others and to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary as regards the article of december the court noted that it had been published the day before bs appearance in the criminal court and that it clearly suggested that he was guilty as he was portrayed as an individual against whom there was a series of sufficiently strong presumptions that he had committed the offence of undue influence it took the view that the court below had wrongly regarded the aim of informing the public as prevailing over the means used namely illegal methods whereby extracts had been selected from statements collected in an investigation in order to show that b had committed the offence of undue influence whereas there had been no judicial decision to that effect it could be understood by the reader that b was not telling the truth about mrs bettencourts mental health and that his guilt was doubly suggested in the introduction citing an extract from the prosecution document which fell under section and in the conclusion it added as follows the reasoning given by the court below is tantamount to legitimising the practice which is legally prohibited of publishing extracts from an investigation file before they are read out in open court first on account of the interest of the subject and secondly while noting bs claim that his right to be presumed innocent was breached the court can not agree with the reasoning of the court below the article of december in so far as it portrays b as having committed the offence of undue influence visàvis mrs bettencourt in the abovementioned context clearly breaches his right to a fair trial including to the presumption of innocence that breach according to the article is exclusively based on the publication of extracts from statements which legally speaking are not addressed to journalists when they are not parties to the proceedings the court would reiterate that for a reader who has an average knowledge of the courts documents from judicial investigations take on particular credibility and an undeniable evidential value the court reaches the conclusion that the date of publication the choices of quotation and the portrayal of b as guilty according to the documents from the judicial investigation even though it had been discontinued had the consequence of influencing his exercise which was legally and conventionally guaranteed of his defence rights which meant that before being heard by a court he should not have been portrayed as guilty of the offence of undue influence against mrs bettencourt b thus finds himself required to give explanations on evidence against him which has not yet been debated in a court of law and which has been taken from an investigation then still secret conducted under the supervision of a judge it is not befitting to consider as did the court below that b had other courses of action available to him being entitled to bring his case to the civil court under section it can not be suggested to the claimant that he should have opted for other types of proceedings on the erroneous ground that his action contravenes article of the convention as regards the article of february the court of appeal took the view that the editorial choices front cover of the magazine presentation of whole swathes of statements highlighting of the exclusive publication of the witness statements constituted a communication of some importance directly aimed at b who had not been able to explain before a court his position on the accusations of the staff it added that the publication portrayed b as being accused by third parties in conclusive terms and that the article was a repeated incrimination of b two months before a hearing at which the epilogue of the case was supposed to take place the applicants appealed on points of law in their grounds of appeal they argued in particular that the ban on publishing procedural documents was a matter of defence of the general interest falling within the sole jurisdiction of the public prosecutor and that a private person could not seek redress for damage on that basis they added that their argument was supported by the fact that b could have under article of the civil code used another legal remedy to ensure the protection of his interests and that the interference with freedom of expression and of information had therefore not been justified or proportionate in a judgment of may giving the following reasons the court of cassation dismissed the applicants appeal having found first that the article of december was based on an analysis of extracts from various statements taken by the criminal investigation police in order to portray b as having taken advantage of mrs bettencourts weakness the day before his appearance before a criminal court which was to rule on the relevance and merits of the accusations made against him by her daughter and secondly that the article of february based on a partial reproduction of statements taken by the criminal investigation police seeking to portray b as being accused by third parties in conclusive terms in order to lead the reader to believe that the case against him was made out two months before a hearing which would constitute according to the article the epilogue of the case the court of appeal reached the conclusion that the publication had infringed bs right to a fair trial with due respect for his right to be presumed innocent and his defence rights d developments in the bettencourt affair since the publication of the offending articles after june there were many developments in the case with its various political and financial repercussions and they were widely reported in the media on november the court of cassation ordered the transfer of all the aspects of the bettencourt case to the bordeaux tribunal de grande instance mrs bettencourts daughter withdrew her claims but the criminal proceedings were later resumed and on december b was placed under judicial investigation for the offence of undue influence in a judgment of may b was found guilty of that offence and sentenced to three years imprisonment of which six months were suspended a fine of eur and the payment of eur million in damages awarded to mrs bettencourt in a judgment of august the bordeaux court of appeal upheld the judgment in respect of the prosecution case and varied the sentence giving b a fouryear suspended prison sentence fining him eur and ordering the confiscation of part of his property the court of appeal also took the view that it did not need to make an award of damages on account of settlements that had been agreed between the parties iii

33,in and lives in gilserberg she was represented by ms g pahl a lawyer practising in hamburg the government were represented by one of their agents ms n wenzel of the federal ministry of justice and consumer protection the facts of the case may be summarised as follows background to the casethe applicants political activities from until early the applicant was a member of the political party the republicans die partei der republikaner the party is generally considered to be rightwing and has been under scrutiny by the offices for the protection of the constitution verfassungsschutzämter in various german länder it has not however been declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court under article of the german basic law for earlier cases concerning members of that party see otto v germany dec no november and erdel v germany dec no february the applicant sat on the schwalm eder district council kreistag and stood for election to both the federal parliament bundestag and to the parliament of the land of hesse landtag on behalf of that party in march the applicant was elected to the district council on behalf of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance bürgerbündnis pro schwalm eder and served in that role until her resignation in late the domestic courts established that several members of that alliances board as composed at that time had links with organisations of the extreme right see paragraphs and below in addition to her membership in and activities on behalf of these parties and organisations the applicant expressed herself publicly at political rallies and in lectures and interviews over the years the applicants employment as a teacher the applicant trained as a teacher for lower secondary schools passing her first and second state exams in and she exercised this profession for limited periods and at irregular intervals in the academic year she worked at a public secondary school in eltville in the land of hesse on a fixedterm contract she received a positive appraisal report for that academic year and in the academic year she again worked at the same school on a fixedterm contract in a letter of march the competent authorities terminated the applicants employment contract with immediate effect citing doubts as to her loyalty to the constitution verfassungstreue in early april the hesse ministry of culture notified all public education authorities in hesse that the applicants employment contract had been terminated on the grounds of significant doubts as to her loyalty to the constitution and asked to be notified immediately if the applicant applied for another post the applicant brought an action against the termination of her employment contract before the wiesbaden labour court those proceedings ended with a friendly settlement concluded on may which read the employment contract will be terminated upon expiry of the fixed term specified therein that is on july the applicant will remain entitled to remuneration until the termination date but will be released from her work duties the parties hereby agree that an offer of employment issued in february will be deemed null and void the land against which the action was brought hereby undertakes to delete from the personnel files any mention of the dismissal the applicant will receive a favourable appraisal report which specifies the date of termination as july that appraisal report was issued on august and any mention of the dismissal was deleted from her personnel files the applicants inclusion on the authorities list in an email of may the hesse ministry of culture asked the darmstadt public education authority schulamt to ensure through the centralised office for the management of teaching personnel that the applicant would not be included on any shortlists of potential teachers for public schools in hesse in late the hesse ministry of culture in cooperation with the decentralised hesse public education authorities decided to set up a list containing information regarding teachers deemed unsuitable for reappointment to a teaching post at a school the list the list was maintained by the centralised office for the management of teaching personnel in hesse and access was restricted to ten individuals working at that office as well as to two individuals at each of the fifteen decentralised hesse public education authorities in the event that they received a job application education authorities in other german länder and private schools in hesse did not have the right to inspect the list and it would have been unlawful to transmit any information in the list to them according to the notification by the hesse ministry of culture the fact that the name of a job applicant appeared on the list did not obviate the need to examine his or her suitability in each individual case public education authorities in hesse seeking to recruit thus retained the discretion to make their own decision as to the suitability of a job applicant included on the list by a letter of december the applicant was notified that her name had been included on the list the list entry concerning the applicant read noninclusion in the shortlist reasons attributable to the person the proceedings in issue on december the applicant requested that her name and information about her be deleted from the list by a letter of january the competent authorities rejected the applicants request the applicant brought an action which in a judgment of august the darmstadt administrative court dismissed as illfounded finding that the applicant was not entitled to have her name deleted from the list her inclusion and retention on the list and the processing of the information relating to her had a legal basis in section of the hesse data protection act in conjunction with sections d and g of the hesse civil servants act see paragraphs below the provisions of the latter act applying mutatis mutandis to state employees who were not civil servants there was sufficient evidence both at the time of her inclusion on the list and at the time of the administrative courts judgment that the applicant was not committed to the free democratic constitutional order freiheitlichdemokratische grundordnung in every aspect of her conduct contrary to the requirements of section second sentence of the collective agreement for public service in hesse tarifvertrag für den öffentlichen dienst des landes hessen see paragraph below the administrative court found that the respondent authority had acted within its margin of appreciation when it had concluded that there were serious doubts as to the applicants loyalty to the constitution and that she was unsuitable to work as a teacher at a public school in hesse indeed it could not be taken for granted that the applicant would uphold the free democratic constitutional order at all times or that she would convey the basic values and principles of the constitution to her pupils in a credible manner observing that political engagement for an organisation that was hostile to the constitution could be a relevant factor even if the organisation concerned had not been declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court under article of the basic law the administrative court considered that the applicant had been an active member of the republicans from to early and had represented that party as a member of the schwalm eder district council and as a candidate in elections at both the federal and land level this membership and these activities in the republicans a party in respect of which there were manifold indications that it was not committed to protecting in particular the dignity of foreigners and asylumseekers living in germany could serve as a first indication that there might be doubts as to the applicants loyalty to the constitution her letter of january to the partys hesse leadership in which she had declared that she was ending her party membership reinforced these doubts her primary motivation for her withdrawal from the party had been that she did not share the concern expressed by the party leadership about cooperation with members of the national democratic party of germany nationaldemokratische partei deutschlands npd who had stood for election to the district council as part of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance in that letter the applicant had displayed an attitude that was very critical of the german state as evidenced by her statements that there was no risk of that alliance abolishing the free democratic constitutional order as such order had ceased to exist a long time ago and that she would make every effort to reinstate a free order deliberately omitting the word democratic her activities on behalf of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance were an important element for assessing the question of doubts as to her loyalty to the constitution several members of that alliance and in particular the members of its board including fr had links to extremeright organisations notably to the npd and neo nazi groups and had become known for their extremist opinions the applicant could not successfully claim that the opinions of the alliances other members could not be attributed to her given that she had chosen to run for the march elections to the district council and to serve as a member of the district council on behalf of that alliance until her resignation in late doubts as to the applicants loyalty to the constitution also followed from her appearance at political rallies of inter alia a youth organisation of the extreme right and her interviews with the npd magazine die deutsche stimme german voice she had engaged in such activities in but also as late as april when she had spoken at a rally of the russian german conservatives stating that sixty years after the war we still bow to what the victors decreed and accept halftruths and lies about our own people her appearances at events of the silesian youth thuringia or the young witikons groups were similarly characterised by aggressiveness towards state institutions while she could legitimately object to kin liability in respect of the political views of her husband who had been described as an american neo nazi previously belonging to an important extremeright organisation in the united states of america and who had served as the district chairman of the npd since the similarity in political views was evident from the fact that four members of the family including the applicant had run as candidates for the district council elections in on behalf of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance the applicant had never distanced herself from her past political activities but had merely declared that she did not intend to be politically active in the future the administrative court considered that at the time of its judgment this was insufficient to dispel the doubts for the purposes of a forwardlooking assessment as to her loyalty to the constitution which had justifiably arisen following years of political activities she could legitimately be expected to explicitly express her commitment to the free democratic constitutional order and to declare that she did not support movements pursuing contrary aims or in the alternative that she had turned away from such movements after having previously supported them however rather than doing so the applicant had defended her activities and merely stated that she did not pursue aims that were hostile to the constitution observing that her retention on the list meant that the applicant for the time being de facto had no possibility of being hired as a teacher at a public school in hesse the administrative court considered that this did not constitute an unjustified interference with her freedom of profession berufsfreiheit under article of the basic law in view of the importance of protecting the constitutional order and the risk that a teacher who opposed that order could abuse his or her role of educating the children entrusted to him or her the authorities were allowed to question the teachers loyalty to the constitution even if there had not yet been any workrelated reproaches applications by the applicant for a teaching post at private schools in hesse or at schools in other german länder were not futile as access to the list was limited to the hesse authorities and could not be transmitted to other authorities for reasons of data protection lastly the applicants inclusion on the list was not in conflict with the friendly settlement concluded in see paragraph above as that did not prevent the authorities from continuing to doubt the applicants loyalty to the constitution and seeking to prevent her reappointment as a teacher at a public school in hesse on september the applicant requested leave to appeal the administrative courts judgment submitting that she was not unsuitable to work as a teacher and that the judgment had breached her freedom of opinion under article of the basic law and her freedom of profession under article of the basic law she argued that not a single school in germany would hire her as a result of her inclusion on the list which had a stigmatising effect she had always strictly separated her political activities and her work as a teacher and there had never been any detrimental effect on her work as a teacher as also evidenced by the positive appraisal reports she had received her previous membership in and activities on behalf of the republicans were not in themselves sufficient to question her loyalty to the constitution nor did these activities or those on behalf of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance render her unsuitable to work as a teacher political views held by other members of that alliance could not be attributed to her as a member of the district council from which she had resigned in late she had never made any statements that were hostile to the constitution xenophobic or extremist she did not intend to pursue any political activity in the future neither the russian german conservatives nor the silesian youth thuringia or the young witikons were deemed to be hostile to the constitution or being monitored for that reason references to her husband were inadmissible she could not be required to distance herself from her prior political activities also bearing in mind that she did not aim to become a civil servant and that a lesser degree of loyalty was required from public employees who were not civil servants lastly her retention on the list was in breach of the friendly settlement reached in in which the authorities had undertaken to remove the dismissal notice from her personnel file this also meant that doubts as to her loyalty to the constitution could not be based on her past political activities by an order of september the hesse administrative court of appeal dismissed the applicants request for leave to appeal as illfounded finding that there were no serious doubts as to the correctness of the administrative courts judgment as regards the compatibility of the impugned measure with the applicants freedom of profession under article of the basic law the court considered that the applicant was unsuitable for a teaching post at a public school in hesse and that the measure which aimed to prevent her reappointment to such a post was proportionate in view of the public interest at stake it was true that not all employees working in public service arbeitnehmer im öffentlichen dienst were per se subject to an enhanced obligation of loyalty to the constitution comparable to the one imposed on civil servants beamte rather the extent of their obligation of loyalty depended on their position and the tasks they performed which meant that teachers were subject to an enhanced duty of political loyalty which was equivalent or came close to the one placed on teachers who were civil servants teachers had to teach the children entrusted to them in a credible manner about the basic values of the constitution children and adolescents in public schools should recognise that freedom democracy and the rule of law were values worth upholding a teacher who did not relate positively to the basic values and principles of the constitution was unable to convince his or her pupils that democracy was worth defending moreover there was a risk that such a teacher would sway his or her students against the basic values of the constitution pupils were wholly at the mercy of the teachers influence the role played by teachers was therefore one of enormous significance from a publicpolicy perspective the administrative court of appeal added that standards differed depending on whether the matter concerned the termination of an existing employment contract or as in the present case potential reappointment to a post whereas general doubts as to the individuals loyalty to the constitution were not sufficient to justify the termination of an existing employment contract such general doubts were sufficient to justify the decision not to recruit an individual with the employer enjoying a margin of appreciation in the applicants case there were sufficient general doubts as to her loyalty to the constitution the existence of workrelated reproaches or detrimental effects on her work as a result of her political activities was therefore not required and the applicants submissions as to her positive appraisal reports and her separation of professional and political activities were beside the point in respect of the existence of such general doubts as to the applicants loyalty to the constitution and her challenges of that assessment the administrative court of appeal in essence repeated the grounds given by the administrative court see paragraphs above the administrative court of appeal added that the pro schwalm eder civic alliance had been deemed hostile to the constitution and that the applicant had voluntarily chosen to run as the alliances top candidate in the elections to the district council as such she could not legitimately avoid being identified with the political aims of the alliances other members and candidates it also reiterated that membership in and activities on behalf of parties and organisations that were hostile to the constitution such as the ones with or on behalf of which the applicant had voluntarily and actively engaged was a relevant aspect in the assessment of doubts as to loyalty to the constitution in the context of the persons potential employment even if the respective parties or organisations had not been declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court under article of the basic law having regard to the foregoing and to the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the land in question in relation to applicants for employment the administrative court of appeal concluded that there were objective grounds for that land to seek to prevent the applicants employment as a teacher at a public school in hesse in these circumstances including the applicant on the list was not disproportionate to the aim pursued the applicants inclusion on the list provided any of the decentralised public education authorities with an effective opportunity to examine existing reservations as to the applicants appointment in a potential future recruitment procedure no more lenient equally suitable measure could be discerned access to the list was heavily restricted which limited the severity of the interference with the applicants rights access was restricted to ten individuals within the centralised office for the management of teaching personnel in the land of hesse which administered the list as well as to two individuals at each of the decentralised public education authorities in hesse the list was for internal use only and the information contained therein was not transmitted beyond the said authorities in hesse notably neither private schools in hesse nor authorities in other länder had a right to inspect the list the impact of the applicants inclusion and retention on the list was therefore limited to making it more difficult or preventing her appointment at a public school in hesse it did not negatively affect the applicants chances of employment at public schools in other länder or at private schools in hesse there was no reason to believe that her job applications at a private school in hesse and at a public school in another land had been unsuccessful because of her inclusion on the list contrary to what she had alleged given that the relevant employers did not have access to it it was much more likely that her applications had been unsuccessful for other reasons or that her political activities and public appearances had led to her being publicly known in so far as the applicant had invoked the friendly settlement of may that agreement did not feature any undertaking in respect of a future reappointment of the applicant at a public school in hesse nor an undertaking that the circumstances which had led to the applicants dismissal would not be considered in connection with her potential reappointment lastly even assuming that the impugned measure constituted an interference with the applicants right to freedom of opinion under article of the basic law such interference was not disproportionate in view of the enormous importance of and public interest in educating children in a credible manner about the basic values of the constitution on october the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint which the federal constitutional court decided not to accept for adjudication without providing reasons decision no bv r of may the decision was served on the applicant on june the applicants political activities after in their observations the government submitted that the applicant had continued to engage in political activities for the extreme right contrary to what she had submitted before the domestic courts by way of example they referred to a lecture given in barcelona in entitled inge godenau la democracia manipulada during the talk a flag of the npd had been on display and a member of the audience had been wearing a tshirt with a slightly modified swastika the promotional materials for the event had described the applicant as belonging to a family of militant and founding members of the npd the government pointed out that a simple internet search of the applicants name brought up a large number of online posts letters and speeches expressing extremist opinions some of which could engage criminal liability with her contributions covering topics such as her nonrecognition of polands national borders her criticism of the presentation of historical events in school textbooks and allegations that the press was lying the government submitted examples of the applicants statements to the court including the following id be remiss to end my post without referring to the brutal regime which allegedly murdered millions of jews and was responsible for millions more deaths during the second world war researchers do not by any means share a single opinion as regards the former and as regards the latter it is now commonly accepted that germany neither planned nor wanted to go to war another statement by the applicant was to the effect that germany had no constitution since a portion of the population remained under polish administration the opinion of the entire german people on the matter had not been sought the applicant did not dispute that she had made those statements relevant legal framework and practice the relevant provisions of the basic law grundgesetz read as follows article everyone shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his or her opinions in speech writing and pictures these rights shall be subject to the limitations laid down by the provisions of the general laws and by

34,the applicant was born in and lives in pirna the applicant had been employed as head of the subdivision in charge of sanctioning misuse of housing property zweckentfremdung in the housing office of the municipality of dresden since on december a meeting of the staff of the housing office took place in the presence of the deputy mayor for economy and housing w an elected official who inter alia governed the housing office and of a number of staff and trade union representatives following a short address on the issue of the expiry of the regulation on misuse of housing property by december given by w the applicant took the floor and accused w of having committed perversion of justice rechtsbeugung by ordering the issue of an unlawful demolition permit for a block of flats in on december the applicants head of division requested the applicant to substantiate his allegations in writing on december the applicant submitted several pages of written comments in which he repeated several times using bold characters his allegations that w had committed perversion of justice by ordering the issue of a demolition permit in without at the same time imposing compensation payments for the loss of housing space caused by the demolition according to the applicant w had ruthlessly pursued politicoeconomic interests he further submitted that all staff members of his subdivision considered that w had deliberately discredited their work furthermore w had unlawfully attempted to dissolve the subdivision thus putting at risk its staffs employment the statement made by w during the staff meeting had been degrading and cynical and had contained halftruths and lies w had not assumed any personal responsibility and did not show any concern for finding a socially acceptable solution to the problems arising from the dissolution of the subdivision by letter of march the municipality of dresden dismissed the applicant with effect from june the dismissal was primarily based on the applicants statement during the staff meeting according to the letter of dismissal the applicants accusations against w had been unjustified by making these accusations in front of a large number of staff members and representatives of the staff committee and of the trade union the applicant had damaged his superiors reputation and thus irrevocably destroyed the mutual trust which was necessary for effective cooperation it was further observed that the applicant had not availed himself of the possibility of submitting his concerns to his superior or to the mayor finally it was noted that the applicant had been reprimanded for disloyal conduct on two previous occasions on july a local newspaper published a letter to the editor in which the applicant expressed the opinion that the deputy mayor w lacked any competence for resolving problems relating to housing issues by judgment of may the dresden labour court arbeitsgericht established that the employment contract had not been terminated by the dismissal since this could not be justified under section of the unfair dismissal act kündigungsschutzgesetz see relevant domestic law below the labour court did not find it necessary to decide whether the applicants allegations had been correct as they were in any event covered by the applicants right to freedom of expression on january the saxon labour court of appeal landesarbeitsgericht dismissed the appeal lodged by the municipality of dresden on november the federal labour court bundesarbeitsgericht upon the municipalitys appeal on points of law quashed the judgment of january and remitted the case to the labour court of appeal no azr under the caselaw of the federal labour court gross insults directed against the employer or the employers representative which constituted a serious violation of the concerned persons honour could justify dismissal on grounds relating to the employees conduct in order to establish the seriousness of the violation of honour it had to be established whether the applicants allegations were based on objective facts account also had to be taken of whether the criticism had been made among staff members or whether other persons had been present finally it had to be considered that employees of the public service had to respect specific obligations under their code of conduct the federal labour court confirmed that the right to freedom of expression always had to be taken into account when assessing inappropriate language in a workplace context and that the applicants allegations fell within the scope of his right to freedom of expression accordingly the court had to weigh this right against the protected legal interest with which there had been an interference the federal labour court considered that the court of appeal when weighing the competing interests had failed to establish correctly the seriousness of the applicants allegations and of the violation of the deputy mayors personality rights under the criminal code perversion of justice was a crime subject to up to five years imprisonment in case of a criminal conviction under this provision a deputy mayor would automatically lose his office the conduct of a public service employee had to be measured against a stricter yardstick than that of an employee in the private sector in particular the employee was under an obligation to behave in such a way as not to interfere with his public employers reputation under the professional code of conduct the employee had to exercise special restraint when openly criticising a superiors decisions a public allegation of perversion of justice directed against a superior in particular if it was unfounded very seriously violated the superiors personality rights and interfered as a rule with the employees professional duties accordingly in order duly to weigh the competing interests in the light of the right to freedom of expression the court of appeal would have to examine whether the applicants allegations had been justified or not it had further to be taken into account that the allegations had been made during a staff meeting while it was true that criticism made in this context could occasionally be exaggerated or polemic without giving the employer a ground for dismissal this right was limited by the obligation not to disturb peace in the office it had to be taken into account in the applicants favour that the staff meeting concerned the suppression of the applicants field of work and that the atmosphere had been rather tense however this did not justify neglecting the fact that the allegation of perversion of justice did not concern the subject matter of the staff meeting but a single incident which dated back several years and had not been mentioned by the applicant since the applicant did not make use of the possibility of informing the mayor about his legal concerns regarding the deputy mayors decision at the time of the staff meeting the decision dated back such a long time that an attempt to put the decision into question must have lacked the prospect of success accordingly it appeared that the applicants statement was rather aimed at attacking the deputy mayor it had also to be taken into account that the statement was made in the presence of persons who were not necessarily bound by confidentiality accordingly there was the risk that the applicants allegations would leak out of this close circle and be made known to a wider public the federal labour court finally observed that the applicants statement had to be seen in the wider context of his conduct and that the applicant had further exacerbated the conflict by the content of his written comments on november the saxon labour court of appeal quashed the judgment of the labour court dated may and dismissed the applicants action the labour court of appeal considered that the applicants dismissal had been justified because the applicant in his statement at the staff meeting and in his subsequent written submissions had seriously insulted and slandered the deputy mayor by accusing him of perversion of justice based on a detailed examination of the factual and legal situation in the labour court of appeal considered that the decision taken by the deputy mayor at that time had been lawful the applicants written submissions of december demonstrated that he was not willing to accept and implement politically legitimate decisions if they concerned sanctions for misuse of property by house owners the content of the letter to the editor see paragraph above contained value judgments which did not amount to insult however the deputy mayor could not be expected to maintain daily cooperation with the applicant after reading this letter in which he had been described as incompetent the labour court of appeal further observed that the applicant had not revised his opinion during the proceedings the labour court of appeal further considered that the employer did not have any milder means at its disposal in particular it would not have been sufficient to reprimand the applicant and to transfer him to another working position the court observed that the applicant was currently working in the public procurement office and that there was no negative information about his conduct this was temporary employment which the applicant had obtained by court order in separate proceedings the applicant had expressed his readiness to accept employment even at a lower level however the labour court of appeal considered that the applicant would not have changed his attitude without his dismissal from office the municipality could reasonably expect that the applicant would have carried on with his selfrighteous attitude if he had not been dismissed

35,in and lives in kyiv he was represented by ms ll pankratova a lawyer practising in the same city the government were represented by their agent most recently mr i lishchyna the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows background to the casethe article of march the applicant is a journalist at the material time he was working for the national weekly analytical newspaper dzerkalo tyzhnya which had a circulation of approximately copies on march in a series of publications written by the applicant an article entitled black triad nothing else matters in the case чорна трійка все інше справи не стосується was published in the above newspaper on march it was published on the newspapers website in the article the author referred to a previous publication of his and noted that in a certain case no which had been pending for some time before the courts and had at least twice been remitted to the lower courts a judgment had been taken on the basis of a forged copy of a document the original of which was part of the materials in the case file in a certain set of criminal proceedings the donetsk commercial court of appeal had nevertheless delivered its judgment on the basis of the forged copy the applicant went on describing what he called a system for obtaining a required result in order to get the result a particular law firm had been contacted the law firm had been paid a substantial fee by the plaintiff but had then surprisingly taken no further part in the proceedings in which the plaintiff a state enterprise had been represented by its own lawyers as for the courts they had carefully referred the case up to the higher commercial court which in turn had taken an excessively long time over the proceedings before finally remitting the case to a lower court for the absence of a copy of the decision complained of in the meantime the plaintiff had been liquidated which according to the applicant had allowed numerous wrongdoings to be hidden the full text of the article reads as follows in may last year dt dzerkalo tyzhnya no may published an article entitled how the court validated the copy of the document while the original document was missing як суд легалізував копію при відсутності оригіналу it discussed an unprecedented legal incident in the history of ukrainian justice that occurred when based on a highly doubtful copy in terms of the quality of the print and even more in terms of the content of a certain document a guarantee letter the court delivered a judgment that has been challenged by the respondent for four years now incidentally it was challenged at the same time as the presidential decree on the formation of appellate courts in ukraine was issued for one simple reason according to the respondent they have never issued a document with such a registration number to the plaintiff and have not provided any guarantees nevertheless since there are many different methods to make any conflict of interest palatable for themis the case has become a kind of symbol of dignity and a fetish of the shortcomings of the very structural judicial system adopted from the developed democracies which was based on a system tainted with sovietness совковостью and telephone law formation of the principles of independence of the third branch of power in our state paragraph dt has repeatedly described the vicissitudes of the litigation and mutual claims of the parties in the dispute in the three years before the publication of the abovementioned article case no underwent two rounds of court proceedings from the court of first instance to the judgment of the supreme court of ukraine there was also a third round under newly discovered circumstances in the scope of criminal proceedings instigated against the limited liability company n which stole from a state transport shipping enterprise intertrans something it was not specified what worth more than million hryvnias uah and then vanished without a trace the prosecutors office discovered the original of the controversial guarantee letter it turned out that the guarantee letter referred to by the plaintiff intertrans had been provided by the defendant to a completely different enterprise which had initially been stated by the party at all the court hearings however for some reason that was never taken into account the donetsk commercial court of appeal could have set the record straight but instead having established the existence of the guarantee letter in the criminal case file it delivered a decision based on a copy of that letter accordingly this author naturally asked the question i wonder what the commercial justice system will come up with this time in order to protect the state enterprisestructure that caused substantial pecuniary damage to the state paragraph reality has surpassed the most daring expectations further immersion in the twilight of this dark and shady subject of how commercial disputes in the donetsk region are resolved gives you the impression that a system exists that is quite primitive in terms of the scheme and reliable in terms of efficiency for obtaining the desired result in almost any case at the same time one gets the impression that the essence of the problem does not matter at all to its facilitators what is important is that the customer usually the plaintiff comes to the right place at the right time paragraph as a rule this is a law firm to which large amounts are legally transferred for legal services subsequently it is difficult to follow what active role the law firm takes in the court proceedings instead the representatives appear or as in the case of intertrans which for some unknown reason paid a fee of uah to the mysterious i are content with the participation of their own lawyers in the court proceedings throughout the entire process the case is considered by a host of servants of commercial justice in the donetsk region who pass it on with care and concern up to the higher commercial court of ukraine paragraph so when the original copy and then an additional document proving the forgery of the copy were discovered it became clear that it was no longer necessary to discuss the adversarial nature of the arguments but the falsification and intent which is not the subject matter of commercial disputes but of criminal investigations and again just the facts the higher commercial court of ukraine hccu made its mark once again contrary to part of article of the commercial procedural code of ukraine which provides for a onemonth period for examining a request for review of a court decision due to newly discovered circumstances the hccu delayed examining the case for nine months paragraph first the hccu received all the necessary materials from the donetsk court of appeal and appointed the day of the hearing but when the parties arrived at kopylenka st in kyiv they discovered that nothing was going to happen apparently the document was missing accordingly the hccu immediately established as it can be seen from the content of the cassation appeal the defendant challenged the ruling of the donetsk commercial court of appeal of june however the case file does not contain the contested ruling or any mentions thereof therefore case no must be remitted to the donetsk regional commercial court for proper registration in accordance with the requirements of the law in force so a new date was set and the donetsk regional commercial court was assigned with a task although its clear that it was meant for the donetsk commercial court of appeal but these are different state institutions arent they or maybe it has been a single structure for a long time a fact the judiciary of the largest commercial court of first instance in ukraine still does not even suspect but which is clear to kyiv and thats why they wrote it paragraph in short so far no one has bothered to answer where the ruling was and where it suddenly came from in the materials of case no they quietly sweep it under the carpet although most likely it wasnt an accident and they were achieving a specific task to delay consideration of the case until february indeed on that very day in accordance with order no of september of the ministry of transport in order to increase the efficiency of the use of state property the liquidation of intertrans was completed and it was removed from the united state register of enterprises and organisations of ukraine everything turned out as planned the court hearing took place after the specified date and the case file has not yet been returned from kyiv to donetsk note this is only a part of the state problem inherited from the previous leadership of the ministry of transport informed sources claim that the liquidation of intertrans made it possible to bury amounts much larger than the unjustly recovered funds from ibank based on the copy however this is yet another topic worthy of journalistic attention paragraph the article ended with the following paragraphs the eighth and ninth paragraphs by the way ch the managing director of jointstock company d conducted an investigation and came to the conclusion that there was an organised group operating in the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal in a letter to the head of the parliamentary subcommittee on combating organised crime and corruption in lawenforcement bodies and courts he set out the names of the members of the group and the detailed mode of operation of the whole scheme as proof ch cited case no in which he had been a defendant against the state enterprise ugolnaya kompaniya krasnolimanskaya concerning the invalidation of a contract as well as a number of other similar disputes which were subsequently quashed by the supreme court of ukraine the judges well known from case no appear everywhere paragraph the reason for my address to the verkhovna rada said ch was case no while the case was going through all the judicial instances i felt the pressure of the system lets say an interested client comes knocking and asks for assistance with a case that will clearly lose they recommend that he goes to law firm l then the contract is concluded with the client the money is transferred and the claim is prepared then in spite of any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge after that the case is always decided in the clients favour if another party lodges an appeal a socalled black triad exists which embraces the principle that nothing else matters in the case most people who have been through these two judicial instances give up they lose their faith in justice and do not apply anywhere else they say to themselves they are all tarred with the same brush paragraph interim injunction proceedings on april judges a c d e b and f applied to the voroshylovsky district court of donetsk city hereinafter the district court for the application of preventive measures and securing of evidence заява про вжиття запобіжних заходів та про забезпечення доказів they argued that the article of march black triad nothing else matters in the case contained a negative evaluation of the activity of the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal and was not based on any facts the style of the article was extremely negative in particular the claimants indicated that the following statements did not correspond to reality an organised group the detailed mode of operation of the whole scheme the pressure of the system assistance with a case that will clearly lose in spite of any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge about existence of a black triad and the principle of nothing else matters in the case the applicant had not verified the information in question and had thus failed to comply with his professional duties according to the claimants the publication in question breached the honour dignity and professional reputation of the abovementioned courts their management and the judges in particular it was noted that judges e c d and f had examined case no which was mentioned in the publication and therefore the article had caused them nonpecuniary damage similar damage had been caused to a the head of the donetsk commercial court of appeal who was responsible for the organisational management of the court and b the deputy head of the donetsk regional commercial court who according to distribution of duties performed management of the structural unit that included the judges who had examined case no the claimants stated that they would lodge a defamation claim for damages against the newspaper the applicant and ch they eventually did so on april and august see paragraph below as the article in question contained elements of an interview ie the last paragraph containing eventually the majority of the untrustful information referring inter alia to articles and of the civil code of ukraine the ccu see paragraph below they argued that their rights were being infringed while the article was still available online and requested its removal under article of the code of civil procedure the ccp see paragraph below the claimants request was for an order against the editorial board of the newspaper to remove the article from the newspapers website in addition they also asked for the attachment of the newspapers property the property of the applicant and that of ch in order to secure their claims finally they asked that the newspaper provide the documents their editorial board and the applicant had used to verify the information published in the article on april the district court ordered the editorial board of dzerkalo tyzhnya to remove the article from the newspapers website in its oneandahalfpage decision the court merely reiterated the content of the claimants request the court then referred to article of the ccp which set out the possible injunction measures for securing a claim and noted that the request should be granted in part providing no reasoning or assessment of the claimants position the applicant the newspaper and ch appealed against this decision noting inter alia that an interim injunction such as taking an article down from a website was not prescribed under domestic law and furthermore that the court had referred to article of the ccp which provided for interim measures after lodging a claim and not before they further noted that the court had failed to provide any reasoning in particular they argued that the article had not named a single judge and that therefore the claimants had failed to prove that their rights had been breached on august the donetsk regional court of appeal upheld the district courts decision having reiterated the claimants request and quoted article of the ccu the court noted the following the challenged article carries information which is disseminated on the internet since such information is accessible to the general public and is difficult to control the removal of the article from the website similar to a property attachment under paragraph of article of the ccp is the only measure that would ensure protection of the individual right pending examination of the case on the merits the firstinstance court relied on article of the ccp which provides for securing a claim by prohibiting certain actions such reference is erroneous since no claim had been lodged at the time when the ruling was delivered however this shortcoming can not serve as a ground for quashing the courts ruling as the request had been examined on the merits correctly the applicant appealed in cassation arguing that article of the ccp did not prescribe any interim measure such as removing an article from a website he further stated that the court had failed to provide any reasoning for its decision and that the claimants had not provided any evidence to support their argument that their rights had been infringed some two and a half years later on january the kyiv court of appeal sitting as a cassation court rejected the applicants appeal against the decisions of april and august for lack of evidence of breaches of the law the above judicial decisions were enforced and the impugned article was removed from the newspapers website on an unspecified date but no later than august subsequent publication on march a the head of the donetsk commercial court of appeal and b a former deputy head of the donetsk regional commercial court sent a letter to the chief editor of dzerkalo tyzhnya demanding a retraction of the information published in the article of march they provided a text to be published for that purpose the letter was received at the office of the newspaper on march on april following the interim injunction issued by the voroshyloskyy district court of donetsk see paragraphs above dzerkalo tyzhnya published an article entitled black triad to be continued чорна трійка далі буде indicating a and b as the authors of the letter requesting the retraction the article which apparently was a summary of the text of their letter of march reads as follows every court case is a complicated tangle of antagonistic interests of the parties and its settlement irrespective of the outcome will always leave one of the parties unsatisfied even when a party understands the lack of grounds for its appeal against the court decision very often only the requirement of paying the court and legal fees would stop it from lodging such an appeal most people naturally consider all decisions in their favour as lawful and fair and vice versa everyone who has acted as a judge in any dispute knows the loser will most probably regard the decision as unfair and biased on march dt dzerkalo tyzhnya published an article by anatoliy yeremenko entitled black triad nothing else matters in the case the article raised very important and relevant problems for modern ukrainian society it cites the story of the managing director of jointstock company d ch who allegedly discovered unlawful activity on the part of judges of the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal however many were surprised by chs hard feelings towards the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal indeed given the number of cases won by jointstock company d and the strength of those cases it should have been more likely for his opponents in those cases to have had reasons to feel that way take for example the decision in case no according to which the claimant jointstock company d was awarded uah however another case no is cited as an example in the article for some unknown reason the request of ds managing director under articles to of the code of commercial procedure of ukraine to have his case examined by a bench of judges being disregarded was not mentioned in the newspaper article we shall explain for those who are not lawyers that these articles provide for the examination of cases by a bench of judges in a local commercial court where their category and complexity so requires however ch based his request exclusively on the necessity to avoid any pressure on the court by the opposite party which is not a ground for allowing the examination of the case by a bench of judges therefore if we follow the letter of the law the court should have rejected chs request as unlawful however having taken into consideration the category of the case and the extensive number of circumstances to be examined the court allowed his request it follows that the claimant is either unable to understand the text of the law but takes the liberty to criticise court decisions or he consciously provoked the court to reject the request in order to have an excuse to complain later about the courts bias but despite the positive decision about the composition of the court in case no ch asserts that then in spite of any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge it is easy to remark that such a conclusion contradicts the facts as well as the conclusion that the case is always decided in the clients favour and that there is a socalled black triad in the court of appeal even more offensive is his final conclusion that they are all tarred with the same brush the only lawful way to receive a decision in your favour is to act within the law and to provide sufficient arguments and valid evidence but some it is unlikely that they could be called lawabiding citizens stop at nothing if the end justifies the means why not try all of them the easiest from a practical point of view but we emphasise not effective and the least ethical way to convince the court to adopt the required decision is to issue a warning in a manner akin to it is better not to mess with me by manipulating public opinion such people try to influence the decisions of public servants including judges indeed hardly anybody would wish to be associated with the black triad currently the donetsk regional commercial court is examining the case in which d is one of the parties so is the tragical farce of ch not an attempt to scare the court and to influence its future judgment suggesting that the black triad article could be continued with the family names of all the judges with firm beliefs and they could later try to prove their integrity publicly it is well known the higher a persons social status the more society is inclined towards believing in the most absurd gossip about them so they have to prove their innocence therefore the negative evaluation of the functioning of the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal was given in the absence of any merit in particular there is no reason to believe that there is an organised group involved in unlawful activity operating in the abovementioned courts there is no practice of assisting interested clients in obtaining positive decisions in cases that will clearly lose in the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal furthermore the employees of these courts never recommend particular law firms it is also untrue that despite any existing procedure the cases are given to the right judge in order to deliver a decision in the case in favour of the client the court does not and can not have clients and decisions in the cases mentioned in the articles were taken after impartial examination of all the circumstances of the cases and the evidence submitted by the parties there are no grounds to conclude that most people who went through the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal gave up and lost their faith in justice and that they do not apply anywhere else on may the claimants sent another letter to the chief editor of dzerkalo tyzhnya demanding that the newspaper print a retraction stressing that their previous request had not been addressed adequately since the publication had been printed without a mention in the title of the word retraction and that it had contained only summarised elements of their letter of march on may the chief editor of dzerkalo tyzhnya replied that the above demand was groundless before the examination of the respective claim by the courts and the pronouncement of the respective judgment defamation proceedings on april and august the same claimants see paragraph above lodged defamation claims against the applicant ch and the editorial board of dzerkalo tyzhnya they claimed that their professional reputation honour and dignity had been damaged by the article in question according to them the statements contained in the article had undermined the authority of the judiciary in their updated claim the judges asked the court to recognise the following statements as defamatory there was an organised group operating in the donetsk regional commercial court and in the donetsk commercial court of appeal that ch had discovered a detailed mode of operation of the whole scheme the pressure of the system an interested client comes knocking and asks for assistance with a case that will clearly lose they recommend that he goes to law firm l then the contract is concluded with the client the money is transferred and the claim is prepared then despite any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge after that the case is always decided in the clients favour if another party lodges an appeal a socalled black triad exists which embraces the principle that nothing else matters in the case and they are all tarred with the same brush they further asked the court to order the editorial board of dzerkalo tyzhnya to publish a retraction of the above statements and to order the applicant and ch to pay ukrainian hryvnias uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage to each claimant they noted that the newspaper had partly restored their rights by allowing them to exercise their right to reply to the allegations in the impugned article and by removing the article from their website in his response to the claim the applicant insisted that the statements concerned contained information important to the general public and the sources of the information were ch and chs letter to the parliamentary subcommittee he further noted that he had duly verified that the letter had indeed been submitted to parliament and that it was a ground for a related inquiry by the lawenforcement services at the same time he stated that chs remarks were in line with the results of his own journalistic investigations in respect of cases nos and which were based on the case files of those cases the applicant considered that since he had received the information from an official of an organisation he was relieved from liability for published material by virtue of section of the press act lastly the applicant noted that the claimants names had never been mentioned in the article and that there were at least twelve other judges who had examined the case in issue in the donetsk regional commercial court but who had not lodged a defamation claim he also referred to his previous article of may in which a and c had been named but against which they had never initiated defamation proceedings in support of his arguments the applicant attached inter alia chs letter to the parliamentary subcommittee the case files of several cases he had examined in the context of his investigation including case no and his previous articles on the topic in question on an unspecified date the applicant and ch also lodged counterclaims the applicant stated that before initiating defamation proceedings and requesting the interim injunction a c d e b and f had illegally obtained his personal information including his name and contact details he asked the court to find such actions unlawful ch asked the court to determine that the information contained in the judges letter to the newspaper published on april see paragraph above was untrue on october the petrovskyy local court examined the case on the merits having analysed the eighth and ninth paragraphs of the article in question the court allowed the judges claim in part the court concluded that the statements contained in those paragraphs were defamatory had presented a distorted view of reality and were not based on actual facts and their publication had resulted in nonpecuniary damage being inflicted on all the claimants the relevant parts of the courts judgment read as follows the information contained in the relevant paragraphs of the article did not correspond to reality and tarnished the honour dignity and reputation of the claimants in view of the following at the court hearing the applicant confirmed that in the eighth and ninth paragraphs of the article he had used information provided by ch including the letter to the parliamentary subcommittee along with chs succinct commentary which disclosed elements of an interview the respondent ch confirmed that the author had used the information provided by him in the eighth and ninth paragraphs of the impugned article upon analysis of the ninth paragraph of the article it is established that it was published in the form of an interview pursuant to section of the copyright and related rights act the copyright of a recorded interview is to be regarded as coauthorship the interviewee and the interviewer are coauthors of the interview the court considers that the applicant and ch are coauthors of the article in the letter addressed to the head of the parliamentary subcommission on combating organised crime and corruption ch stated that an organised criminal group was operating in the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk regional court of appeal which on demand provided judgments and rulings required by clients he named the members of the group and described how it operated ch also sent this letter to the state security service and was informed that his allegations were being verified in response to an enquiry of the donetsk commercial court of appeal on april the administration of the security service of ukraine in the donetsk region reported that upon examination перевірки of chs allegations no proof of the existence and activities of such an organised criminal group in the abovementioned courts had been found therefore the relevant statements published in the eighth paragraph of the article had not been proved and accordingly they were untrue the article referred to chs letter to in which he directly mentioned a criminal organisation that existed in the abovementioned courts even though the article did not reproduce the content of that letter the statements in the eighth and ninth paragraphs suggested to the reader that the existence of a criminal group was being discussed in their description of the procedure for distributing and examining cases the coauthors of the article accused the judges of the above courts not only of violating bylaws but also of what could be interpreted as abuse of office and a miscarriage of justice both being criminal offences the expression organised group was used in the article in the criminal sense and was associated with a criminal offence committed by an organised group pursuant to article of the constitution of ukraine a person is presumed innocent of committing a crime until their guilt is proved in accordance with the law and established by a verdict of a court no such verdict has been delivered in respect of the claimants by any domestic court and therefore those statements were defamatory at the same time the court can not take into consideration the defendants arguments according to which at the court hearing they had provided evidence in support of their statement as to the existence of a special procedure for examining cases in view of the following as noted above the statements as to the existence of a special procedure for examining cases in the abovementioned courts constitute an accusation that a crime has been committed which must be proved by certain means in view of article of the constitution as to the presumption of innocence the above statements can be proved only by a verdict of a court which does not exist in respect of the claimants section of the press act provides that a journalist is exempted from liability for the publication of material that is untrue defames the honour and dignity of citizens and organisations infringes the rights and lawful interests of citizens or constitutes abuse of the freedom of the printed mass media and the rights of journalists if the information is contained in a reply to a request for access to official documents and to a request for written or oral information provided in accordance with the information act section of the information act provides that a request for access to official documents is a request addressed to relevant state authorities or its officials in order to examine the official documents since jointstock company d was not a state body and its managing director ch was not an official of a state authority his letter could not be considered an official document within the meaning of section of the press act and section of the information act under section of the information act value judgments are not subject to retraction or proof of veracity the information in the eighth and ninth paragraphs of the article particularly the following statements can be interpreted as containing factual information and thus they are not value judgments ch came to the conclusion that there was an organised group operating in the donetsk regional commercial court and in the donetsk commercial court of appeal an interested client comes knocking and asks for assistance with a case that will clearly lose they recommend that he goes to the law firm l then the contract is concluded with the client the money is transferred and the statement of claim is prepared then in spite of any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge after that the case is always decided in the clients favour if another party lodges an appeal a socalled black triad exists which embraces the principle that nothing else matters in the case by virtue of article of the ccu one of the elements of the offence is dissemination of information about a person which would enable an observer to deduce that it concerns a specific identifiable individual or at least that the person belongs to a group of people to whom such information pertains indication of the persons name is not obligatory for information to be considered as concerning a specific person if he or she is identifiable on the basis of other elements the claimants a c d and e are judges at the donetsk commercial court of appeal and b and f at the donetsk regional commercial court in addition a is a head of the donetsk commercial court of appeal and b used to be a deputy head of the donetsk regional commercial court in the article the authors assert the existence of an organised group in the abovementioned courts which has been found by this court to be inaccuratefalse this fact alone tarnishes the dignity honour and reputation of the managing officials of such courts namely a and bas proof of the existence of an organised group in the abovementioned courts the authors refer to case no having examined the case file of the above case the court established that b assigned f to examine case no f was a presiding judge at the firstinstance courts examination of this case and e c and d further examined this case in the court of appeal thus as a result of the publication of untrue information all of the above judges sustained nonpecuniary damage including b who at the material time was deputy head of the donetsk regional commercial court and was managing the court division comprising the judges who had examined the case at first instance a the head of donetsk commercial court of appeal who is responsible for the organisational management of the court where the case in issue was examined on appeal also sustained nonpecuniary damage the court dismisses the respondents arguments concerning the fact that the names of the claimants had not been mentioned since the coauthors of the article provided sufficient information to identify them in addition the information on judges examining the domestic cases was not restricted the copies of the court decisions had been sent to the parties and information about these judges could be known to an unlimitedunrestricted number of persons when setting a compensation to be paid to the claimants by the applicant and ch the court noted that the applicant was guilty to a lesser degree since it was ch who had provided him with the information however the applicant had failed to verify the information and had thus failed in his professional duties as set out in section of the press act the court ordered the editorial board of dzerkalo tyzhnya to publish a retraction of the statements contained in the eighth and ninth paragraphs of the article and the applicant to pay uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage to each of the claimants plus their legal uah per claimant and court fees uah per claimant in total the applicant was ordered to pay the equivalent of euros eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage and eur in respect of legal and court fees ch was ordered to pay uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage per claimant plus legal and court fees finally the court dismissed the applicants and chs counterclaims as unsubstantiated the applicant appealed against the judgment of october of the petrovskyy local court relying on the following arguments i the court had failed to substantiate the existence of the nonpecuniary damage by not giving concrete reasons for the effect the article had had on the claimants and their psychological health ii the court had failed to make a distinction between the facts and value judgments in this respect the applicant noted that the phrase tarred with the same brush was clearly a value judgment yet it had not been examined by the court separately and had been found defamatory as a part of the whole text iii the material in the case files of case no and a number of other cases were sufficient to conclude that the statements published in the article were true iv the court had failed to examine the existence of mens rea in the applicants actions v the court had gone beyond what had been claimed in the complaints and had found defamatory the wider content of the statements published in the article he referred to the fact that the court had relied on the full text of the eighth and ninth paragraphs instead of only the particular statements quoted by the claimants in their complaints for example the phrases ch concluded and most of the people and vi the amount of the court fees he had been ordered to pay to the claimants was excessive on january the donetsk regional court of appeal upheld the firstinstance courts judgment on the merits and modified it concerning legal and court fees reducing the court fees imposed on the applicant to the equivalent of eur the relevant parts of the appellate courts judgment read as follows it follows from the content of the impugned article that the respondent ch had conducted his own investigation and concluded that there was an organised group in the donetsk regional commercial court and donetsk regional court of appeal with reference to the letter of the head of the subcommittee of verkhovna rada naming the members of the group and the detailed mode of operation of the whole scheme there are references to cases no and the ninth paragraph contains a direct speech and it discusses on behalf of ch case no at the court hearing the respondents maintained that the information published as to the existence of an organised group in the courts in question was true they insisted that case no as well as other cases had been allocated by b and a to their judges in violation of the orders on specialisation of the courts composition they submitted the orders allocating the cases noting the breaches allegedly committed during the allocation of case no and others the court reasonably rejected the respondents arguments the allocation of cases in the courts in question is an internal matter for the court and such circumstances can not point to the existence of an organised group or functioning of a scheme with interested clients at the time the article was published the claimants had not been convicted or found liable of acts of corruption it follows from the certificates in the case files that all the

parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on the functioning of democratic institutions in armenia the presidential elections involved a political crisis in armenia the resolution states inter alia that the parliamentary assembly regrets that the violations and shortcomings observed did nothing to restore the currently lacking public confidence in the electoral process and raised questions among a part of the armenian public with regard to the credibility of the outcome of the election this lack of public confidence was the basis for the peaceful protests held without prior official notification that ensued after the announcement of the preliminary results and which were tolerated by the authorities for ten days the assembly deplores the clashes between the police and the protesters and the escalation of violence on march which resulted in deaths and about people being injured the exact circumstances that led to the tragic events of march as well as the manner in which they were handled by the authorities including the imposition of a state of emergency in yerevan from to march and the alleged excessive use of force by the police are issues of considerable controversy and should be the subject of a credible independent investigation the assembly condemns the arrest and continuing detention of scores of persons including more than opposition supporters and three members of parliament some of them on seemingly artificial and politically motivated charges this constitutes a de facto crackdown on the opposition by the authorities while the outbreak of public resentment culminating in the tragic events of march may have been unexpected the assembly believes that the underlying causes of the crisis are deeply rooted in the failure of the key institutions of the state to perform their functions in full compliance with democratic standards and the principles of the rule of law and the protection of human rights the,,,
38,the applicant was born in and lives in debrecen he is a practising lawyer and member of the békés county bar association at the material time the applicant was appearing as the legal representative of a hunting association before the battonya district court on march he filed with the court a notice of appeal for the attention of the secondinstance békés county regional court in which he also requested this court to initiate proceedings with a view to examining the firstinstance judges competence to exercise the duties of a judge in his appeal he wrote inter alia of course we do not assume any professional incompetence on the side of the sitting judge thus the fact that he appointed a guardian ad litem despite explicit objectionis the first proof of his bias questioning whether or not the general assembly of the respondent was entitled to suspend its session continue at a later point and call another general assembly is not a question of bias but that of clearcut professional incompetence because the judgment reflected the personal opinion of the judge and was not based on any evidence we can not but call into question the professional competence of the sitting judge his conduct was guided either by sympathy for the plaintiff or a dislike for the respondent and this was also represented in the judgment in a state based on the rule of law where proceedings should be based on the constitutional independence of judges such judicial bias can not be permissible based on the above besides our request for appeal we also request the county regional court to forward our motion to the authority responsible for initiating proceedings to examine the professional incompetence of the judge the motion was transferred to the békés county regional court whose vicepresident indicated to the békés county bar association that in his view the applicants submissions should give rise to disciplinary proceedings on april the president of the bar association informed the applicant about the opening of disciplinary proceedings on april the applicant submitted his observations contesting the initiation of the disciplinary proceedings in the ensuing proceedings the szeged bar association disciplinary board dealt with the case on june it fined the applicant hungarian forints huf approximately euros eur for having committed a serious disciplinary offence on appeal on november the national bar association disciplinary board upheld this decision in essence the applicant sought judicial review on september the budapest regional court remitted the case to the disciplinary instances essentially on procedural grounds in the resumed disciplinary proceedings on april the disciplinary board fined the applicant huf eur for having committed a deliberate disciplinary offence the board was of the opinion that the expressions of course we do not assume any professional incompetence on the side of the sitting judge this is not a question of bias but that of clearcut professional incompetence and we can not but call into question the professional competence of the sitting judge amounted to disrespecting the courts dignity and to denying the judge the requisite respect this was a disciplinary offence consisting of the applicants breaching the relevant ethical obligations on november the national bar association disciplinary board upheld this decision endorsing the firstinstance disciplinary boards position that the tone and language of the impugned statement was unacceptable and prejudicial to the reputation of lawyers on june the budapest regional court dismissed the applicants action challenging the disciplinary sanction the court did not agree with the applicants contention that in expressing the impugned statements he had merely exercised his procedural rights that is that he had requested the exclusion of the sitting judge for bias it also found that the statements had accused the court as an institution and not merely the sitting judge of circumventing the law on april the supreme court rejected the applicants petition for review endorsing the regional courts reasoning it dismissed the applicants argument that the disciplinary measure had infringed his procedural right exercised in his capacity as defence counsel to lodge a motion for bias reiterating the regional courts findings the supreme court held that contrary to what the applicant had argued his notice submitted following the closing of the firstinstance proceedings see paragraph above could not possibly serve the purpose of seeking the exclusion of the sitting judge for bias it further found that in as much as the applicants request could be interpreted as initiating proceedings to have the judges professional competence examined the reason for which he had been subjected to a disciplinary measure was not the very request but its tone ii relevant domestic law act no xi of on attorneys at law provides as follows disciplinary

40,the first applicant organisation is the vienna chamber of medical doctors ärztekammer für wien the chamber represents all medical practitioners in vienna and also has its own website the second applicant was the chambers president at the time of the events a statement in issue and injunction proceedings on january the second applicant published a letter on the first applicant organisations website which was addressed to all members of the chamber in vienna and was also sent out to all of them via email the letter was titled locust funds want to take over medical practices heuschreckenfonds wollen ordinationen übernehmen the second applicant went on to state that he had been forced to write to his colleagues for a serious reason namely because it had been reported in the media that the f company planned to go into the radiology business he added that sharebidding companies planned to offer medical services initially in the area of radiology but soon enough in other areas of the profession as well and that doctors risked becoming mere employees of such locust companies if they would not act according to the companies wishes they would be dismissed the second applicant then explained the assumed legal and organisational basis of such a plan radiology services which were currently being provided by medical practices could in future also be offered by limited companies shares of those companies could then be bought by the f company and the locusts would reach their goal namely control of the medical profession giving an example of a risky development the second applicant stated that in the last years colleagues had founded laboratories which had reciprocal agreements with certain health insurance boards today almost all of those laboratories were owned by the f group which in turn was owned by insurance companies investment funds and foundations and which employed a large number of doctors the second applicant ended his letter by stating that he could guarantee one thing that the doctors professional representative body would make use of all legal and political means available to stop such a disastrous development from going ahead to prevent that the quality of medical treatment being determined by managers and controllers and to ensure inter alia that existing medical practices were protected from the competition from international locust funds internationale heuschreckenfonds on january the f company lodged an action against the two applicants and an application for an injunction with the vienna commercial court handelsgericht wien the applicants contested the application on february the vienna commercial court issued an injunction prohibiting the applicants each of them individually from repeating the statement that the f company was ruthless towards third parties in particular medical professionals the injunction prevented the applicants from referring to the f company as a locust locust company or locust fund the applicants were further prohibited from stating that the provision of services by the f company particularly services in the area of radiology was a disastrous development the court found that there was a competitive relationship between the f company and the applicants and found the statements made by the applicants to be defamatory under article of the civil code and unethical under the unfair competition act bundesgesetz gegen den unlauteren wettbewerb the applicants appealed against the injunction on october the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht wien partly granted the appeal and prohibited the applicants from alleging that the f company was ruthless towards third parties and medical practitioners and from calling it inter alia a locust company however it dismissed the f companys application to prohibit the applicants from calling its provision of services a disastrous development the court of appeal found that the first applicant organisation had locus standi in the injunction proceedings the chamber of medical doctors held official authority status in relation to certain areas of its work bereich der hoheitsverwaltung in addition to representing the interests of its members it was therefore considered a legal entity under the official liability act amtshaftungsgesetz however when acting as a special interest group it represented its members interests from a mainly economic perspective rather than acting in its capacity as an official authority according to the court of appeal the letter in issue pursued the interests of the chambers members outside the chambers official sphere of activity the court of appeal further established referring inter alia to wikipedia that the term locust company heuschreckenunternehmen was introduced into the political discussion in german speaking countries in by mr franz müntefering a german politician and is ever since used in political debates as a pejorative term for privateequity companies or other forms of capital funds with shortterm or exaggerated return expectations like hedge funds or vulture funds which also had negative connotations the domestic court found that there was a need to balance the interests involved in the present debate reiterating that extreme opinions were only unlawful if they were excessive as a result of that balancing exercise the court of appeal found that the locust statement had to be considered a lawful criticism in the context of a public debate and that the f company could therefore not base its claim on article of the civil code however the court of appeal classified the applicants actions as competitive in nature statements of fact made in violation of the unfair competition act could not be justified by the right to freedom of expression the court of appeal found that austrian law provided wideranging protection for commercial and economic interests those who published an opinion in an economically competitive context were obliged to exercise a higher level of diligence with regard to the facts and bases of their allegations than those who acted in the noncompetitive context of a public debate of general interest therefore the court of appeal upheld the injunction decision with regard to the statements about the locust company however as regards the further statement namely that provision of certain services by the f company was a disastrous development the court of appeal found that read in context the statement indicated a general assessment and did not refer to a particular service of the f company it was therefore to be considered a personal opinion and thus a value judgment that was not defamatory under article of the civil code it also did not fall under section of the unfair competition act the applicants lodged an extraordinary appeal with the supreme court oberster gerichtshof on january the supreme court dismissed the extraordinary appeal it acknowledged the applicants argument that where a competitor even for economic purposes took part in a debate of public interest freedom of expression had to hold more weight in the balancing test however the supreme court observed that the applicants had made their statement in the clearly economic context of competition between medical practitioners and companies which provided the same services the applicants could have warned their members of the possible risks of cooperating with companies without overstepping the margin of acceptable criticism however the applicants had exceeded that limit and stated that the f company was a locust that statement was one of fact and the applicants had not provided evidence of a factual basis for their allegations and had therefore exceeded the permissible limitations of freedom of expression b substantive proceedings on july the commercial court gave its judgment in the substantive proceedings and ordered the applicants to refrain from repeating the statement that the f company was ruthless towards third parties in particular medical practitioners and patients and stating that the f company was a locust company a locust fund or a locust it further ordered the applicants to publish and display the operative part of the judgment on the first applicant organisations website for thirty days and to publish it in the first applicant organisations print newsletter the commercial court made substantial reference to the court of appeals reasoning in the interim injunction proceedings it followed the previous finding that the relevant statements did not constitute defamation pursuant to article of the civil code examining the statements in relation to the provisions of the unfair competition act the commercial court found that the letter had been written by the chamber of medical doctors in a commercial and not a political context it had also had the advancement of independent medical practices as an objective and had contained a warning regarding capital ventures which allegedly threatened doctors independence the commercial court found the relevant comparisons with locusts to be statements of fact regarding both the f company and its conduct in relation to third parties doctors and patients the statements were also likely to damage the f companys commercial interests and had not been proved to be true the used language could also not be justified with a reference to the right to freedom of expression as the statement was uttered within the framework of a commercial competitive relationship with reference to the courts caselaw allowing for a wider margin of appreciation under article of the convention with regard to commercial language the commercial court observed that a competitor was required to be more diligent in the context of commercial communication among competitors the term locust was almost exclusively loaded with negative meaning which led to the unethical general vilification of a competitor the applicants were therefore prohibited from using that statement in relation to the f company pursuant to the unfair competition act on september the applicants lodged an appeal against that judgment on december the vienna court of appeal dismissed the appeal as unfounded it referred to the extensive reasoning given in the interim injunction proceedings and added that according to the caselaw of the supreme court the test used to verify whether a statement was covered by the right to freedom of expression required the assessment of whether a factual basis for such a statement existed if a competitor participated in a public debate of general interest freedom of expression had more weight with regard to the assessment of the statement than in the context of purely commercial communication the greater the public interest in being properly informed and the less the statement related to commercial interests the more the statement would be protected by article of the convention in the present case there was no doubt that there was an ongoing public debate however the commercial interests of the applicants had very much been in the foreground of the communicated statement itself the applicants lodged an extraordinary appeal on points of law against that judgment which was rejected by the supreme court on july the supreme court found that the applicants had not only called the f company a locust but had also reproached this company for negative conduct such as dominating doctors dismissing doctors who did not act in accordance with company wishes and focusing on economic factors rather than the welfare of patients herrschaft über den ärztlichen berufstand kündigung nicht spurender ärzte orientierung an ökonomischen erwägungen und damit nicht am wohl der patienten therefore the expression used had turned into a statement of fact giving the reader the impression that the f company had already demonstrated unethical conduct which threatened the interests of doctors and patients in view of the specific circumstances of the case the prohibition ruled upon by the lower courts was justified even though the applicants had taken part in a debate of general public interest an untrue and damaging statement of fact was not protected by freedom of expression furthermore the issuing of warnings concerning the potential risks of the provision of medical services by companies was not as such prohibited by the decisions of the austrian courts the applicants had only been required to refrain from making untrue statements of fact

41,background to the case the applicant was born in and lives in weinheim he is a campaigner against abortion and operates an antiabortion website in december there was an ongoing public debate on developments in human embryonic stemcell research as part of the debate the catholic bishop f voiced criticism of human embryonic stemcell research and a group of scientists at the university of bonn responded to that criticism on december bishop f issued a press release repudiating allegations that his earlier comments had implied a degree of similarity between the scientists carrying out embryonic stemcell research and the nazis who had performed experiments on humans he emphasised that he had had absolutely no intention of casting such defamatory aspersions upon the scientists but reasserted his belief that there was an urgent need for such vitally important ethical issues to be debated critically he claimed that he had never wished to imply that there had been any link between stemcell research and the ideological and historical context of the crimes committed by the dehumanising nazi system which should not be relativised through comparison on december the applicant issued a press release for his initiative never again nie wieder e v with the title dogs which have been hit bark stemcell research in germany getroffene hunde bellen stammzellenforschung in deutschland the press release was published on the internet and handed out as leaflets it read the initiative never again nie wieder e v and the austrian christian social working group christlich soziale arbeitsgemeinschaft österreichs wish to make known their opposition to the press release issued by the university of bonn on december which bears the signatures of eighteen wellknown professors and in which the professors express their outrage at the comments made by bishop f name abbreviated by the court comparing modernday stemcell research to the experiments on human beings carried out by the nazis the professors appear to have forgotten that these experiments were performed in nazi times by willing doctors and scientists these doctors and scientists who were clearly in bondage to the rogue state and subservient to it also carried out their research solely for the good of the people the research performed during the nazi regime took place at a later stage of human life the presentday research takes place at an earlier stage of human life do the professors want to determine humans right to life on the basis of how useful they are the principle of human dignity does not apply only after a particular phase of growth has been completed and people should not be allowed to experiment at will during this phase the professors can spin it any way they want aggravated murder mord will always be aggravated murder regardless of the stage of life at which the human being is destroyed the fact that others were responsible for performing these contract killings does not provide moral justification for working with this human material the comments made by bishop f name abbreviated by the court which were presumably addressed directly to prof dr b name abbreviated by the court were absolutely accurate prof dr b uses embryos people for research purposes at the university of bonn that were murdered in israel and then sold to germany for significant sums of money during nazi times german scientists performed research experiments on jews and then murdered them nowadays the unborn children of people who follow the religion of moses the jews are murdered and sold to the christian country of germany for research purposes all with the blessing of both israel and germany the comparison drawn by bishop f was entirely justified the crimes against democracy being committed in the here and now must be denounced in the strongest possible terms and brought to peoples attention the time has finally arrived to overcome the spirit of auschwitz b criminal proceedings on november the weinheim district court convicted the applicant of insult and sentenced him to a penalty of thirty daily fines of euros eur each in its judgment the court acknowledged the applicants right to freedom of expression and to impart to others his beliefs that the fusion of an egg and a sperm represented the beginning of human life and that research using imported stem cells from terminated embryos involved the destruction of human life it also emphasised that the applicant had the fundamental liberty to exercise his freedom of expression by imparting his opinion strikingly and pointedly including in the form of abusive criticism addressed at wellknown researchers referred to by name however the court found that when viewed in its entirety the press release had exceeded the permissible bounds of abusive criticism the court based this decision on the fact that the implication that the scientists had been guilty not just of committing murder but of doing so for deeply despicable motives had been a central theme running through the press release and had escalated in the phrase the time has finally arrived to overcome the spirit of auschwitz it concluded that the applicant had intended to imply that the scientists carrying out stemcell research had been prompted by the same criminal sadistic and dehumanising motives as those responsible for performing unimaginably cruel mass experiments on humans such as mengele in auschwitz given prof dr bs position as a doctor and scientist this implication had been severely insulting on march the mannheim regional court rejected the applicants appeal similarly to the district court the regional court acknowledged the applicants right to freedom of expression and that his press release had contributed to a debate of great public interest it further held that the majority of the statements in the press release had been value judgments and that therefore the press release had to be classified as a value judgment and not as a statement of fact nonetheless the court stated that freedom of expression was not granted unconditionally and could be subject to restrictions with a view to protecting inter alia the right to personal honour when examining contributions to a debate of public interest however there had to be a presumption in favour of freedom of speech the regional court further found that the criterion for abusive criticism had not been met criticism which was excessive or even aggressive in nature was not necessarily abusive the relevant criterion was whether the main purpose of the criticism had been to defame an individual rather than to debate the relevant issue the court concluded that this was not applicable in the case at hand since the applicants past behaviour and the content of the press release showed that the focus had been on the issue rather than the individual doctor against whom allegations had been made the court therefore found that the right to freedom of expression had to be balanced with the legally protected personality rights of prof dr b and emphasised that freedom of expression granted equal protection to all statements of opinion regardless of whether they were useful useless correct incorrect emotional rational or even polemical or insulting the regional court took into account that the press release had represented the applicants contribution to the formation of public opinion but believed that referring to prof dr b by name had been equivalent to linking his professional conduct to the atrocities committed by the nazis it concluded that this had represented a serious infringement of his personality rights which had also been unnecessary since the applicant could have contributed to the debate without referring to the professor by name on february the court of appeal rejected an appeal on points of law by the applicant as unfounded and on july the federal constitutional court refused to admit a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant without providing reasons bv r ii relevant domestic law the relevant provision of the german basic law grundgesetz reads in so far as relevant as follows article every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech writing and pictures and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources these rights shall find their limits in the provisions of general laws in provisions for the protection of young persons and in the right to personal honour the relevant provisions of the

intended to photocopy and photograph the criminal case material stored in the archives of the court registry by a decision of august the court registry stated that the second applicants request could not be granted in its current form more specifically it invited her to specify exactly which information andor documents she wished to consult and for what purpose stating that it would review its decision upon receipt of the requested information the registry advised the second applicant that the criminal case file in question contained certain classified investigative information public disclosure of which was strictly prohibited section and of the special investigative activities act of april it further advised her that the criminal case file contained personal data about te as well as other parties to the criminal proceedings in question and that public disclosure of that information was only possible with their explicit consent article of the general administrative code the second applicant never provided the further clarification sought by the court registry instead on september she lodged a court action concerning the registrys decision of august requesting its annulment as confirmed by a statement of claim dated september filed with the borjomi district court the second applicant acting on behalf of the first applicant did not explain the purpose of her request to access the criminal case file in question she merely claimed that the registrys decision of august had restricted her right of access to information of public interest which was enshrined in article of the general administrative code according to the transcript of a hearing before the borjomi district court on december attended by both parties the second applicant briefly mentioned that she needed to obtain access to the criminal case file for the purposes of a journalistic investigation project however she did not give any details about the project in question and relied exclusively on the general argument that her right of access to public information should not be limited she further provided extensive legal arguments as to why the respondents interpretation of the relevant provisions of the special investigative activities act and the general administrative code had been erroneous by a judgment of december the borjomi district court dismissed the second applicants action as illfounded it confirmed that the respondents decision to withhold the criminal case material from the second applicant had been legitimate and based on a correct interpretation of section and of the special investigative activities act and article of the general administrative code on january the second applicant appealed against the judgment of december complaining that the firstinstance court had incorrectly interpreted the relevant provisions of domestic law in her statement of appeal she focused exclusively on her right to have unfettered access to public information without giving any details as to why she had sought access to the criminal case material according to the transcript of a hearing before the tbilisi court of appeal on june attended by both parties the second applicant stated i as a journalist no longer need access to the criminal case material because the journalistic investigation has already been terminated and its results have already been published however she emphasised that what was important for her was the creation a legal precedent that would acknowledge the significance of the right to have unfettered access to information of public interest she considered that a criminal case file was public information within the meaning of article of the general administrative code and that anyone was entitled to have access to it by a judgment of june the tbilisi court of appeal dismissed the second applicants appeal as illfounded and upheld the judgment of the lower court on february the supreme court rejected an appeal on points

of appeal dismissed the applicants action as illfounded the court stated that the relevant chapter of the general administrative code and more specifically article thereof which provided for the right to receive public information from the state and regulated the procedure for the exercise of that right did not apply pursuant to article and of the same code to the judiciary within the framework of the administration of justice in that connection the court attached significance to the fact that all six of the criminal cases about which the third applicant had tried to obtain information were

43,in and lives in kassel he was represented by mr b hopmann a lawyer practising in berlin the government were represented by ms g marok wachter director of the office of justice of the principality of liechtenstein the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows the events leading to the applicants dismissal the applicant is a doctor specialised in general and internal medicine from june he was employed as deputy chief physician of the department for internal medicine at the liechtenstein national hospital liechtensteinisches landesspital a registered liechtenstein public law foundation he worked under a contract of indefinite duration which could be terminated with six months notice his direct superior was dr h chief physician of the said department on september the applicant did some research in the electronic medical files of the hospital he found information showing that four patients had died in the hospital following the administration of morphine he concluded from notes made in these files that dr h who had treated these patients had practised active euthanasia on the same day the applicant met with the president of the control committee of the liechtenstein parliament the parliamentary control committee mr m on the latters initiative following several anonymous complaints about deficiencies in quality in the liechtenstein national hospital on that occasion the applicant voiced suspicions that dr h had practised active euthanasia on september the applicant on mr ms advice lodged a criminal complaint against dr h with the public prosecutors office which instituted proceedings against dr h on suspicion inter alia of killing on request and participation in another persons suicide on september the police seized the paper medical files of the four patients concerned at the liechtenstein national hospital and questioned dr h on september the applicant following further research in the hospitals electronic medical files informed the public prosecutors office that he suspected that dr h had practised active euthanasia on six additional patients he was questioned by the police on the same day he supported his suspicions by the fact that according to the electronic files the death of these patients had occurred shortly after the start of the treatment with morphine that morphine had been given even without an indication that the patients suffered from pain that the treatment had been called supportive therapy or supportive measures and having regard to the medication administered he stressed that the aim of his statement was to avert damage to patients of the hospital at the time of the events the liechtenstein national hospital had a body to which irregularities could be reported anonymously via an online form the critical incident reporting system cirs while initially dr h alone had been the person examining and acting upon such reports this task had been entrusted to a group of three persons not including dr h since summer at the latest it is unclear when this change in responsibilities was communicated within the hospital the applicant did not contact this body on and september the vicepresident of the hospitals foundation board drew up three reports on the request of the foundation board regarding the treatment of the ten patients in question having examined the patients paper files and having questioned dr h he concluded that all patients had been in a palliative situation under the whos standards and that there had not been any mistake regarding the morphine administered he considered that the applicant had failed to take into account the pain or difficulty in breathing of the patients concerned which had made necessary the treatment in question if the applicant had read the patients paper files which alone as had been known at the time had contained complete information regarding the patients condition and treatment and to which he had had access he would have realised immediately that his suspicions of active euthanasia were clearly unfounded on september the applicant was suspended from office on october the applicant made a written statement setting out his position to the national hospital on the latters request he explained that he had done some research in the electronic files of several patients who had died in the past weeks following an indication by a doctor working in the hospital that recently there had been an unusual rise in deaths of patients in the hospital in his view the ten patients concerned had clearly not been treated lege artis after thorough reflection he had decided to inform the public prosecutors office in order to protect the patients and the hospital and to comply with his own ethical convictions and the provisions of the physicians act ärztegesetz see paragraph below as he was convinced that there had been criminal offences as he had not expected the matter to be investigated properly within the hospital and in view of the urgency of the situation he had not contacted an internal body of the hospital prior to lodging a criminal complaint with the public prosecutors office in a report received by the national hospital on october a swiss external medical expert in palliative medicine commissioned by the hospital n having studied the medical paper files of the patients concerned and having heard dr h concluded that no active euthanasia had been practised on the ten patients in question the expert considered that the patients palliative treatment had been necessary and justified as they had been at the end of their lives they had died as a result of their illnesses and not as a result of their treatment they had been given morphine in order to treat their pain and difficulty in breathing and not to end their lives the expert noted that some of the morphine doses prescribed especially those without upper limit may not have been necessary but such doses had never been administered in practice on october the director of the national hospital dismissed the applicant without notice he considered that owing to the applicants severe fault the relationship of trust with him had been destroyed irretrievably he argued that the applicant had failed to raise his allegations of active euthanasia and quality flaws with the hospitals competent internal bodies prior to raising them externally with the president of the parliamentary control committee and with the public prosecutors office the applicant had been obliged to inform dr h or at least the director of the hospital or a member of the foundation board with whom he had a normal relationship of his allegations furthermore the applicants allegations of euthanasia had been considered as clearly unfounded by the external expert commissioned by the hospital the liechtenstein newspapers and radio repeatedly reported on the suspicions of active euthanasia at the liechtenstein national hospital and the criminal investigations against dr h in this respect the outcome of the criminal investigation proceedings against dr h and against the applicant the investigating judge in the criminal proceedings against dr h had also commissioned an external expert practising in austria l in his report dated october received by the investigating judge on december the expert having regard to the medical paper files of the patients in question came to the conclusion that dr h had not practised active euthanasia the patients had been given morphine only as necessitated by their palliative situation and this treatment had not caused the patients death doubts regarding such palliative medical treatment and ethical decisions taken in that context could be excluded by a better documentation of the treatment in the future on december the criminal proceedings against dr h were discontinued on december criminal proceedings instituted against the applicant for having deliberately cast wrong suspicions of a criminal offence on another person by his allegations that dr h had practised active euthanasia were equally discontinued the proceedings before the domestic courts proceedings before the regional court on november the applicant brought an action against the liechtenstein national hospital for payment of some swiss francs chf in compensation for the loss of salary and further pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage he claimed that his dismissal without notice had been unlawful there had been no important reason for his dismissal as lodging a criminal complaint against dr h had been justified in view of the concrete suspicions of active euthanasia and the gravity of the offence concerned on august the regional court dismissed the applicants action it found that the applicants dismissal without notice had been justified under article a and of the civil code see paragraph below the court considered in essence that there had been an important reason for the employing hospital to terminate the employment contract as the applicant had failed to sufficiently verify his unfounded suspicions of active euthanasia in the patients medical paper files and to signal his suspicions within the hospital prior to informing external bodies thereof the continuation of the employment relationship by the hospital could no longer be expected in good faith proceedings before the court of appeal on january the court of appeal allowing an appeal lodged by the applicant quashed the regional courts judgment it ordered the defendant hospital to pay the applicant chf in salary arrears and remitted the remainder of the case to the regional court for a fresh consideration of the applicants compensation claims the court of appeal found that the applicants dismissal without notice had not been justified the disclosure of irregularities to third persons was covered by the right to freedom of expression and could justify a dismissal only if it was coupled with a serious breach of the duty of loyalty however there was no such serious breach in the present case the court of appeal argued that the institution of proceedings against dr h by the public prosecutors office confirmed that the applicants suspicions had not been unfounded in view of the severity of the offence at issue contacting external bodies such as the parliamentary control committee or the public prosecutors office which were both under a duty of confidentiality had not been disproportionate the fact that the applicant had reported directly to the public prosecutors office did not raise an issue in this respect the court further agreed with the applicant that in the circumstances of the case reporting the issue to dr h in the context of the internal mechanism to report irregularities had not been a suitable approach proceedings before the supreme court on may the supreme court allowing the defendant hospitals appeal on points of law quashed the court of appeals judgment it dismissed the applicants claim for payment of chf in salary arrears in a partial judgment and remitted the remainder of the case to the court of appeal in a partial decision for it to dismiss the applicants action in that regard the supreme court considered that the applicants dismissal without notice had been lawful it stressed that the applicant a senior employee had only consulted the electronic medical files which he had known to be incomplete although he could have consulted the paper files at any moment if he had done so he would have recognised immediately that his suspicions were clearly unfounded he had thus failed to verify his serious and unjustified allegations before disclosing them to third persons and before lodging a criminal complaint this conduct amounted to a serious breach of trust in relation to his employer which justified his dismissal without notice proceedings before the constitutional court on june the applicant lodged a complaint with the constitutional court against the partial judgment and partial decision of the supreme court he argued that his dismissal had breached in particular his right to freedom of expression under the constitution and article of the convention reporting his suspicions of active euthanasia to external bodies had been justified whistleblowing on september the constitutional court found that the applicants constitutional complaint was admissible as the supreme court had taken a final stance on the applicants action but dismissed the complaint on the merits

dismissal was not an act of public authority but was governed by private law the right to freedom of expression nevertheless applied indirectly in their relationship indirekte drittwirkung the constitutional court accepted that the applicant regarded himself as a whistleblower having regard to the criteria developed inter alia by the european court of human rights in the case of heinisch v germany no echr extracts on freedom of expression in the context of whistleblowing the constitutional court found that the applicants right to freedom of expression had not been violated by his dismissal without notice it recognised that there was a considerable public interest in medical treatment which was in accordance with the state of the art in a public hospital moreover the civil courts had not found that the applicant had acted out of personal motives the constitutional court noted however that the applicant had failed to test his suspicions regarding the practice of active euthanasia arising from the electronic medical files by verifying the paper files of the patients concerned had he done so he would have realised immediately that his suspicions which could be considered comprehensible having regard to the electronic files alone were clearly unfounded in the light of the gravity of the allegations and the consequences for all concerned by them in the event that these allegations became public the applicant had been obliged to proceed to such verification even more as he had known that the electronic files had been incomplete the applicant had therefore acted irresponsibly therefore his right to freedom of expression had not been breached the constitutional court just as the supreme court could thus leave open whether the applicant prior to raising his allegations externally should have attempted to raise them internally notably with the director of the hospital the judgment was served on the applicants counsel on november relevant legal

practice resolution of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on the protection of whistleblowers in its resolution on the protection of whistleblowers adopted on april the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe pace stressed the importance of whistleblowing concerned individuals sounding an alarm in order to stop wrongdoings that place fellow human beings at risk notably as an opportunity to strengthen accountability in both the public and private sectors see point of the resolution it invited all member states to review their legislation concerning the protection of whistleblowers keeping in mind the following guiding principles the definition of protected disclosures shall include all bona fide warnings against various types of unlawful acts including all serious human rights violations which affect or threaten the life health liberty and any other legitimate interests of individuals as subjects of public administration or taxpayers or as shareholders employees or customers of private companies the legislation should therefore cover both public and private sector whistleblowers and it should codify relevant issues in the following areas of law

internal whistleblowing channels from any form of retaliation unfair dismissal harassment or any other punitive or discriminatory treatment where internal channels either do not exist have not functioned properly or could reasonably be expected not to function properly given the nature of the problem raised by the whistleblower external whistleblowing including through the media should likewise be protected any whistleblower shall be considered as having acted in good faith provided he or she had reasonable grounds to believe that the information disclosed was true even if it later turns out that this was not the case and provided he or she did not pursue any unlawful or unethical objectives the above guidelines were also referred to in the parliamentary assemblys related recommendation adopted on the same day recommending inter alia that the committee of ministers draw up a set of guidelines for the protection of whistleblowers point recommendation cmrec of the

indirectly by their employer and by persons working for or acting on behalf of the employer forms of such retaliation might include dismissal suspension demotion loss of promotion opportunities punitive transfers and reductions in or deductions of wages harassment or other punitive or discriminatory treatment protection should not be lost solely on the basis that the individual making the report or disclosure was mistaken as to its import or that the perceived threat to the public interest has not materialised provided he or she had reasonable grounds to believe in its accuracy where an employer has put in place an internal reporting system and the whistleblower has made a disclosure to the public without resorting to the system this may be taken into consideration when deciding on the remedies or level of protection to afford to the whistleblower further council of europe texts and other international instruments the parliamentary assembly recalled its resolution in

circulation of he also occasionally published articles in other local newspapers apparently as a freelancer on march lazarevskaya panorama a local newspaper with a circulation of published an article by the applicant headlined why i will not vote in these elections in which the applicant stated why he would abstain in the presidential election that was due to take place on march the article was placed on the front page of the newspaper that had a headline in large red type saying time to vote there were two subheadings yes in red and no in black the text was divided into two columns the left side gave the statements of five people who were going to vote while the right side contained the applicants article the applicants article read in its relevant parts as follows we are going to have a presidential election soon it is difficult to grasp the game between good and evil this time so here is my decision first of all i am not a puppet in the hands of political gangs who are making a farce out of the presidential election they only need our participation in the election for the sake of giving it an impression of a legal process one which will result in the dislocation of russia this might explain the sad results of government by the two recent rulers of the state as a result we have what we have widespread corruption on a broad platform of lies created by the press under the control of the state and oligarchs platitudes depravity and aggressive propaganda in favour of violence flow out at us from our television screens that is how it all goes however it is all depicted as the reconstruction of the state the strengthening of the economy and the rule of law on the background of growing wealth for the people which people i suddenly thought does it really matter was the answer from the television screen it would not be politically correct to give a specific answer to that to avoid complaints secondly in fifteen years of new style democracy no russian person русский человек has seen anything good he has been pushed down to the level of a simpleton who is to serve various small ethnic groupings that call themselves republics within russia or elsewhere in the russia destroyed by the bolsheviks they were called non russians or the non russian population and no one took offence at the time everyone stayed within his own locality doing his best to make it wealthy no one was irritated by that so what happened where do we stand today those who on account of their ethnic национальные characteristics had engaged in criminal activities or tended their sheep or goats or prayed to their god abandoned their motherland and came here they now call themselves builders entrepreneurs cultural workers or whatever is needed to get their hands into others pockets just look around and you will see crowds of them staring at you greedily at every corner we will be victorious over you all we hold all these kuban people they say during their closed meetings in their own language that of russians do not understand but they will speak russian later when they have totally paralysed our will that is when they will start to burn slaughter rape rob and enslave in line with their barbaric ideas as it was in chechnya but for the time being it is all friendship and solidarity between nations for the time being that is and the president of russia is handing out hero of russia decorations to slave traffickers they participate in the destruction of the country various processes of destruction dominate our society today that is why i will not take part in the election however i express my hope that when taking his decisions the new president will take into account the views i have expressed for myself and for those who are not going to vote on march the article was accompanied by the applicants photograph and indicated that he was leader of the local branch of the democratic party of russia the same text was reprinted in sochi drugoy vzglyad on december the front page of the newspaper had an article titled a campaign of criminal prosecutions on political motives has started in sochi about the criminal proceedings against the applicant for that text see below the article was repeated in small print at the bottom of the same page this issue of sochi drugoy vzglyad also contained a separate page with varying opinions expressed by various people in relation to the applicants text and his ongoing criminal prosecution one comment was made by a lawyer who considered that the main thread of the article concerned various destructive processes in the country arising for instance from inefficient migration policies adversely affected by widespread corruption at the same time the article contained no calls to action in particular violent actions and could not be classified as extremist activity the article also contained a statement by the leader of the lazarevskoye district branch of the armenian union of russia it also contained the applicants open letter in reply to that statement it was specified in the article that on december the applicant had had a meeting with the lazarevskoye district branch it appears that both newspapers were distributed for free by being put into peoples letter boxes within several streets in the sochi area including lazarevskoye village for the second publication in the meantime a criminal preinvestigation inquiry was opened on suspicion of inciting hatred and enmity and at debasing the human dignity of a person or group of people on account of their ethnicity in this connection in august an investigator sought an opinion from professionals in language and psychology ms b and ms r professionals in language and psychology issued their joint report on november the report concluded as follows the text contained statements disclosing a negative attitude toward a social group on the basis of its ethnicity language and religion some phrases extended certain negative characteristics of some members of a non slavic group to the entire group as such the text contained no phrases calling for violence against them on november and then in january the applicant was accused of an offence under article of the criminal code in relation to each publication that offence was punishable by inter alia a fine from to russian roubles rub a court could also prohibit a person from exercising a certain activity for a period up to three years the applicant was charged with committing actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity and at debasing the human dignity of a person or group of people on account of their ethnicity национальность language origin and religious beliefs during the preliminary investigation mr f a specialist in philology also issued a specialist report заключение специалиста according to fs report the article contained an implicit incitement to violent acts against people of a certain social group on account of their ethnicity race religion or other social characteristics the investigator in the case commissioned another expert report заключение эксперта ms l and again ms r professionals in linguistics and psychology issued their joint report on january a the linguistics part of the report stated as follows the content of the applicants text concerned political and social issues addressed to a large audience the main part of the text started at the phrase which people that introduced his subsequent discussion based on the opposition between the russian people and the population of the non russian origin the author presented their ethnic characteristics as the reasons for the suffering of the russian people the author had used what could be described in linguistics as hate speech or aggressive language creating an enemy image he had used expressions that would be insulting to any ethnic group while he had not named any specific group it was clear from the context that he meant essentially non slavic ethnicities of central asia northern caucasus and transcaucasia from certain parts of the text it became clear that he was talking about the armenian ethnicity among others the text did not contain phrases calling for violent actions against a person or a group of people on account of hishertheir social status race ethnicity language gender or religionb the psychology part of the report concluded as follows the article contained phrases disclosing a negative attitude toward a social group on the basis of its ethnicity language and religion those phrases could be perceived as inciting readers to feel hatred and enmity the text did not contain phrases calling for violent actions against a person or a group of people on account of hishertheir social status race ethnicity language gender or religion the criminal case against the applicant was sent for trial before the lazarevskiy district court of sochi the applicant pleaded not guilty and affirmed that the text represented his own personal views and opinions after some minor stylistic changes on the part of the newspapers editor the applicant had approved the publication by way of his signature of the newspaper issues layout the applicant also argued that he had not had anything to do with the publication of his text on december see paragraph above the court examined the documentary evidence including the expert opinions and heard several witnesses for the defence the court dismissed an application by the applicant to summon f for questioning in court about his report apparently neither the prosecution nor the defence deemed it necessary to obtain oral submissions from the other experts whose reports had been admitted in evidence by a judgment of july the district court convicted the applicant of inciting hatred and enmity debasing the human dignity of a person or group of people on account of their ethnicity language origin and religious beliefs the trial court phrased the accusation against the applicant as follows in an intentional and premediated manner the applicant worded the main part of his text by way of an opposition between the people of russian ethnicity русский народ and members of other ethnicities национальности residing in russia while making statements that would be insulting and degrading to the dignity of any ethnicity he indicated that the troubles of the russian population lay in the non russian groups ethnic characteristics thus creating an image of enemies moreover the applicants assessment of the situation of the people of the russian origin is intentionally provocative being aimed at inciting hatred within the people of russian ethnicity toward other ethnicities giving a negative assessment of any group on account of its origin non russian ethnicity or on account of their language or religious beliefs the applicant made statements about criminal propensity of those groups and affirmed the existence of their conspiracy against the kubans that is to say residents of krasnodar region he attributed to the non russian residents bad intentions toward the russian population thereby creating a negative image of people prone to commit crimes in kuban moreover in his article the applicant characterised people of non russian origin as inherently ignorant rude cruel inhuman aggressive and prone to crime against the russian population having secrets plans and conspiracies against people of russian ethnicity the applicants statements about future violent actions on the part of non russian ethnicities toward the russian people are phrased as statements that can not be verified as to their veracity because they have no factual basis and do not go beyond his own speculations clearly being aware that krasnodar region is a multiethnic region and that newspaper articles have an active influence on many people the applicant disseminated his strong views thereby undermining the confidence and respect toward a certain ethnicity a certain religion and inciting hatred and enmity toward a certain way of life culture traditions and religious cults of the non russian population reproducing the concluding remarks from the expert opinions fs report and listing other evidence for each count of the accusation the court concluded that the applicant was guilty as charged as to the publication of the applicants article in sochi drugoy vzglyad on december the court noted that the applicant was the founder of that newspaper that he had signed a contract for printing the relevant issue and paid for it and had then received the whole issue and had distributed it the trial court sentenced the applicant to a fine of rub euros eur at the time for each time the article had been published it also imposed an additional sentence prohibiting the applicant from exercising any journalistic or publishing activities for two years noting the expiry of the prosecution period in respect of the first article the court ordered that the related sentences were not to be enforced as regards the first article the court also held as follows the author made manifestly provocative statements when assessing the situation of the russian people thus inciting his readers of russian origin to feel hatred towards other ethnicities nationalities the author made a negative statement about various groups on account of their origin being different from that of russians thereby the author made intentional statements concerning the criminal propensities of certain groups asserted that there was a plot by non russians against the population of the kuban area that is to say russians living in krasnodar region he said non russians had plans to harm russians thus creating a negative image of non russians he described non russians as ignorant rude cruel or inhuman those are conjectures that are aimed at instilling fear as regards the type of sentence and its severity the court takes into account the nature and degree of dangerousness of the relevant offences the information about the defendants personality the circumstances that plead for mitigating or aggravating the sentence and the sentences potential for correcting the defendants behaviour pursuant to article of the criminal code the two offences committed by the defendant are offences of minor gravity the defendant has been given average reviews from his neighbours no mitigating or aggravating circumstances have been established in view of the foregoing and bearing in mind the aim of restoring the justice and the principle of proportionality the following elements are taken into account the influence of the sentence in terms of correcting the defendants behaviour and noting that it was the first time he had committed those offences of minor gravity that he has been taking care of an elderly mother that he is selfemployed as an entrepreneur thus the court imposes the sentence in the form of a fine given that all the offences concerned a journalistic activity the court finds it necessary to impose an additional sentence consisting in prohibiting him from carrying out a certain type of activity the applicant appealed stating inter alia that the trial courts refusal to summon defence witness f had undermined the defences rights the applicant indicated that f had been interviewed during the preliminary investigation as a specialist and had then submitted a report see paragraph above on september the krasnodar regional court upheld the judgment relying on the expert reports it made no findings relating to the lack of opportunity to put questions to f during the trial for unspecified reasons the applicant did not pay the fine on august the lazarevskiy district court of sochi examined a bailiffs request found that the applicant had manifestly evaded payment of the fine and replaced the fine with two hundred hours of community work other relevant material on december the council of europes european commission against racism and intolerance ecri adopted general policy recommendation no on combating hate speech in its relevant part the recommendation reads as follows the european commission against racism and intolerance

45,background the applicant editorial board of grivna newspaper is a ukrainian single shareholder company which has its registered offices in kherson grivna is a regional newspaper published in that city hereinafter the newspaper in the newspaper published two articles containing negative statements about mr i who from to was president of the kherson regional court of appeal the articles gave rise to defamation proceedings which are the subject of the present case the translation of the relevant parts of the articles is given below the passages which were the subject of the domestic proceedings are underlined and numbered for reference the parts of the articles rephrased and summarised by the court are presented in square brackets where initials are used the actual articles contained is full name his first name surname andor patronymic in various combinations in january the plenary verkhovna rada of ukraine hereinafter the parliament was to examine the question of is appointment to the position of judge on a permanent basis until retirement age the matter was to be examined because is previous tenyear appointment was expiring see the relevant constitutional and legislative rules concerning the appointment of judges at paragraph below prior to the parliaments session on january another regional newspaper vgoru published an article alerting the readers that the matter of is permanent appointment would be examined by parliament and urging readers to send comments on is candidature to the relevant parliamentary committee b article a application no publication on january parliament examined the question of is permanent appointment owing to concerns raised by some members of parliament about is candidature see the summary of the transcript of the debate at paragraph below parliament decided to adjourn the examination of the question an article published in the issue of the newspaper dated january was dedicated to the above event and entitled purgatory for judges чистилище для судей it spread over two full pages the first page of the article contained the following text we often criticise members of parliament and for good reason but this gathering of people with different views and business interests under the same roof sometimes produces unpredictable decisions perhaps it is too soon to call this democracy however the fact that the mps have rejected the advances of the president of the kherson court of appeal mr i получил от народных депутатов гарбуза a speaks volumes so let us talk about justice in the kherson region and first of all about its president mr i below we publish a transcript of the proceedings of parliament concerning appointment of judges for life on january many kherson residents watched live this sitting of parliament and our mr i was the main hero of that show a we have been writing about him much lately other publications have been writing even more we will provide our readers with a brief reminder about mr i based only on our own publications which by the way have not been challenged we are also in possession of a number of incontrovertible documents we give you this in lieu of a prologue in his eight years and counting at the head of the regional court i has found himself dozens of loyal people lawyers judges and important businessmen for whose personal and business interests he has successfully lobbied through favourable judicial decisions a обзавелся десятками преданных людей чей бизнес и личные интересы успешно лоббировал с помощью нужных решений в судахhere is the conclusion i is considered the person in charge and untouchable a in the kherson region where governors succeeded each other in years if one removes him successfully even if peacefully the people will believe in changes for the better in the pervasively corrupt judicial system this document arrived in our offices last autumn it was addressed to a very highranking and influential official in the capital in response to his request for information from kherson but the first official documents had appeared right after i took up his position and they corroborate the abovementioned reasoning here is just a short quote from the letter by members of the regional council to the president of the supreme court dated using his position i received us dollars from g who has been released from serving his sentence and confiscation of his assets he thus helped g avoid his liabilities visàvis his creditors they go on to describe is tricks проделки on two pages a and here is the response of the supreme courts president to the abovequoted episode there followed a quote from a letter of the president of the supreme court stating that in april i had been reprimanded for a breach of professional ethics by the qualifications commission of judges so i has been duly punished at the very dawn of his career it appears that the lesson did him good since our offices have no information about the highest judge of the region receiving any subsequent reprimands a new person became the supreme courts president soon afterwards and i could feel more confident perhaps his relative at the supreme court helped to make it so a a relative so influential that he is now awaiting his appointment to the constitutional court and now is year term as judge is coming to an end new laws provide for lifetime appointment by a majority vote in parliament and here our president has made himself famous nationwide прославился на всю страну a the article then mentioned judge o whose resignation was discussed at the same plenary sitting of parliament as is appointment but mr i is a hard nut to crack and is dreaming of keeping his post no matter what крепкий орешек и несмотря ни на что он мечтает сохранить пост a the first page of the article also contained extensive quotes from articles previously published in february april and may in the same newspaper in particular one dated april which discussed assets allegedly belonging to i and his relatives that article contained quotes from a letter of the chairman of the council of judges dated april the letter contained an acknowledgement that judge d president of the civil division of the supreme court was the fatherinlaw of is son almost the entire second page of the article was taken up by the verbatim reproduction of the transcript of parliaments plenary sitting of january at which parliament examined questions about the appointment and resignation of a number of judges according to the transcript several mps said that they had received complaints about the situation in the kherson regions courts i denied any wrongdoing and stated that all complaints had been checked by the appropriate authorities and found baseless the head of the relevant parliamentary committee stated that the committee had also conducted an inquiry into complaints raised about i and found them to be groundless he also implied that i might have been a victim of a slander campaign orchestrated by aggrieved litigants however in view of the concerns raised by several mps is candidature was withdrawn for additional checks a brief discussion followed concerning judge o from one of the district courts of the kherson region who had presented her resignation to parliament one of the mps made a speech to the effect that judge o had resigned to avoid responsibility for bribery the newspapers reproduction of the transcript was followed by the following conclusion as you can see dear readers representatives of the kherson justice system have distinguished themselves twice it was not only mr i who disgraced himself in front of the entire country a but also his subordinate from one of the district courts mr is photograph was displayed on the first page of the article covering approximately one sixth of the page he was shown in formal attire with a neutral facial expression apparently sitting at a desk under the photograph the following caption appeared i will recompense them according to their deeds old testament mr i is shown in the photo in the same issue of the newspaper another photograph of i was published with the caption parliament so far has not given a life sentence to the president of the kherson court of appeal the copy of the article provided to the court by the applicant company does not contain that second photograph within the next two weeks other newspapers published at least three articles commenting in critical terms on the parliamentary session dedicated to is appointment and his activities in general domestic proceedings i brought a claim in the kherson suvorovsky district court against the applicant company seeking retraction of statements aa and compensation for nonpecuniary damage he argued that the publication in the newspaper which had a circulation of had negatively influenced his professional reputation and public opinion of the judicial system at large triggering actions aimed at putting pressure on the courts namely numerous demonstrations outside the regions courthouses the case was tried by judge s trial judge according to the applicant company in the course of the trial it produced by way of proof of the factual grounds for the impugned statements twentyfive articles published in the local newspapers from to on april the applicant company lodged an application with the supreme court urging it to reassign the case in view of the plaintiffs position to a court in a different region see paragraph below for the relevant domestic legal provision it argued in particular that the trial judge had previously examined a claim lodged by is son himself a vice president of a district court in kherson and had allegedly breached the law in those proceedings it also argued that as a longterm president of the kherson regional court of appeal i had supervisory functions in respect of all judges in the region on april the applicant company asked the firstinstance court to postpone hearings in the case until the supreme court had ruled on its reassignment application i objected the court decided not to postpone the hearings on may the applicant company asked the court to suspend proceedings in the case under article of the code of civil procedure see paragraph below pending examination by the supreme court of its application for case reassignment the court refused the applicant company challenged the trial judge on the grounds that he had rejected its request to suspend the proceedings the judge rejected the challenge on may the firstinstance court delivered its judgment allowing the claimi the court declared a the photographs and captions to them and statements aa and aa baseless insulting and damaging to is reputation and b statement a untrue and damaging to is reputationii the court ordered the applicant company to publish its judgment and awarded i ukrainian hryvnyas uah in compensation for nonpecuniary damage and uah in court fees about euros and euros eur respectively at the timeiii by way of reasoning the court stated that statements aa and aa could not be protected as value judgments since they were deliberately insulting article of the convention permitted restrictions on freedom of expression for the protection of the reputation of others neither the transcript of parliaments plenary sitting nor other documents before the court provided a factual basis for those statementsiv the defendant had failed to prove the truth of the factual statement a or to point to the source of that informationv as to the photographs the court considered that the applicant company had failed to prove that is photographs had been taken either with his consent or at a public event while it was established that the photograph with the biblical quote see paragraph above had been taken at an official meeting on may it presented only i and not the event in general and so was unrelated to the event the defendant had thus exercised the choice of which fragments of the photographs to publish selecting those where only the plaintiff was shown in a certain light combined with the captions added this demonstrated that publication of the photographs was intended as an attack on the plaintiffs honour and dignityvi the totality of the circumstances showed for the court that the applicant companys purpose in publishing the impugned statements and photographs was deliberately to damage is reputation on may the supreme court apparently unaware that the examination of the case at first instance had already been completed reassigned the case to a district court in the mykolaiv region on the grounds that a judge was a party to the proceedings the applicant company appealed against the firstinstance courts judgment arguing in particular that the court had not been impartial because it had refused without giving particular reasons to suspend proceedings while the reassignment application had been pending before the supreme court the applicant company also argued that the firstinstance courts judgment was contrary to article of the convention as to statement a the applicant company alleged that is daughterinlaw the wife of his son was the daughter of d who at the time was the president of the civil division of the supreme court the plaintiff was not contesting that fact the use of the term perhaps in statement a showed that it had been meant to communicate that the author was wondering whether a relatives presence on the supreme court was protecting i rather than being a positive affirmation that this was indeed the case it was thus a value judgment and was true on july the supreme court reassigned the case at is request to the zaporizhzhya regional court of appeal on august the zaporizhzhya regional court of appeal varied the judgment of the firstinstance court and reaffirmed the essential part of its reasoningi the court of appeal reduced the amounts awarded to uah for nonpecuniary damage and uah for court fees about eur and respectively at the time having regard to the applicant companys financial situation and upheld the remainder of the firstinstance courts judgmentii by way of reasoning the court of appeal stated that according to the caselaw of the european court of human rights the fact that the subjects of published information had public status made such persons more open to criticism but did not deprive them of the right to sue to defend their reputationiii the court of appeal found unconvincing the applicant companys argument that it had pursued the legitimate aim of informing the public as opposed to damaging is reputation as president of the regional court given that the impugned statements and captions to the photographs had been presented as a narrative about certain circumstances розповідь про певні обставини the firstinstance courts conclusion that they could not be seen as value judgments but rather as insults had been justified an insult was a statement made not with the purpose of communicating information but with the purpose of insulting a person in its appeal on points of law the applicant company reiterated essentially the same arguments as in its previous appeal see paragraph above as to statement a the applicant company added that a letter from the chairman of the council of judges of ukraine dated april and quoted in the impugned article see paragraph above was in the file the letter was addressed to a certain mr b and contained a detailed response to his complaints against i the council stated in particular that the fact that d was the father of is daughterinlaw did not mean that i had abused his position on march the odessa regional court of appeal acting as the court of cassation amended the lower courts decisions by rejecting is claim for damages retaining only the award of court fees see paragraph i above it held that the very fact of the decisions in his favour constituted sufficient redress for i it upheld the remainder of the lower courts decisions it held in particular that the trial judges failure to suspend proceedings pending examination of the reassignment application by the supreme court did not constitute grounds for quashing its judgment the court held that the aim of the impugned phrases had been solely to humiliate and disparage a representative of the judiciary and the phrases had made no contribution to the resolution of the problems in the administration of justice criticism of a judge was possible in the context of a public debate on problems related to inefficiencies in the judicial system or to a judges lack of independence or impartiality however the impugned article had not discussed those issues as concerns the matter of impartiality of the firstinstance courts judge the court of appel made no comment the court of cassation stated that the fact that that judge had refused to suspend the proceedings and had rejected the challenge against himself see paragraph above did not constitute grounds for quashing the lower courts decisions c article b application no publication the article published in the issue of the newspaper dated may was authored by ms k who was at the time the director of the applicant company and entitled excourt president is burying lady justice under his claims экспредседатель суда завалил фемиду исками its relevant parts read claims raining down on the independent media of the kherson region from mr i who until recently used to be president of the regional court of appeal can not be called anything other than a trend newspapers which take a consistent line in favour of a just and honest judicial system are being targeted it seems that i has had enough of a clear and consistent position of mr s the head of the kherson city committee of the union of retired officers of the armed forces and law enforcement following a defamation claim against the grivna newspaper mr i also sued the vik newspaper which had published ss open letter to the regional governor s had asked the governor to state his position concerning the events which became a topic for examination in the parliament and are constantly in the newspapers in his letter the author appealed to the governments representative in the hope that he would not remain an impartial observer but could influence the situation as regards justice in the region b claims of retired servicemen seeking increases in their pensions to which they are entitled by law have been pending before the courts of the region for two years while in other regions pensioners get the money to which they are entitled by law in our region only several dozen pensioners managed to get their money why do the courts work this way in our region b remarkably this publication in the vik newspaper was not the end of contacts between s and i literally days after the publication of that issue the letter writer and the judge had a conversation at the request of the latter s says that a dressingdown is the only term that can describe the tone of the conversation after this meeting the officers hope of establishing a dialogue with the judge and of clarifying the situation collapsed this was the subject of a new open letter he addressed directly to mr i and then something totally unexpected for the retired submarine officer happened he was attacked at night by strangers received a serious blow to the head obliging him to be hospitalised a coincidence the relevant authorities could answer this question but they initially refused to register ss complaint about the attack he has not been informed about the results of the investigation bthis is the short story of the contacts between s and i the final touch to the story will be a court judgment on the defamation claim the claim will be examined by the same judge st of the suvorovsky district court who surprisingly gets to examine is claims in contrast to the case against our newspaper where i is seeking damages for himself in the case against vik his claims are entirely selfless he is asking that damages be paid to an orphanage charity is of course a laudable enterprise but the editorial boards of both grivna and vik understand that the point of the operation is not to get some money затеяно все далеко не изза желания получить деньги bmost likely court decisions in his favour would come in handy for i when parliament again examines the question of his lifetime appointment claims granted at first instance and on appeal may serve as proof for the argument that journalists unjustified attacks this is how lady justices servants call our critical publications are made up and baseless b especially because judge st does not take into account a seemingly logical idea that if one of the parties is a court or a judge then the case should be examined by a higher court b domestic proceedings i brought a claim against the applicant company and k seeking retraction of statements bb and compensation for nonpecuniary damage as regards in particular statement b the plaintiff submitted that it was based entirely on ss account of the events and that the author of the article had made no attempt to obtain the version of the kherson regional courts staff as far as the attack on s was concerned the story was presented in such a way as to generate a cheap sensation by creating the impression that i was somehow implicated in the attack according to the applicant company in the course of the trial it produced as proof of the factual grounds for the impugned statements twentyfour articles published in the local newspapers from to the applicant company also produced the letter from s to the regional governor reference to which was made in statements b and b in the letter dated february s stated that i possessed property which could not be explained by his lawful income and that the parliament had refused to appoint i on a permanent basis the region was one of the last in ukraine in terms of delivering lawful just decisions in cases of retired military officers who sought to defend their right to a decent pension in the courts s asked the governor to explain why i was still allowed to remain in the position of the president of the regional court and why the governor did not intervene on august the zaporizhzhya shevchenkivsky district court allowed the claim in part ordering the author of the article to apologise by retracting statements bb and the applicant company to publish the retraction in the newspaper the court awarded uah about eur at the time in compensation for nonpecuniary damage from the defendants jointly and severally to be paid to an orphanage the following elements of the district courts reasoning are worthy of notei referring to article of the convention the court stated that the public status of the subjects of publications did not deprive them of the right to protection of their reputation even though the impugned statements constituted value judgments they were insultingii according to the caselaw of the european court of human rights the fact that subjects of the published information had public status made such persons more open to criticism but did not deprive them of the right to sue to defend their reputationiii the impugned statements were insulting the defendants had failed to provide evidence of grounds for such statements and the evidence they did provide did not contain incontrovertible facts which would allow assessment of the person of the plaintiff and the work of the court over which he presided не містять беззаперечних фактів які б дозволили оцінити особу і діяльність судуiv referring to article of the information act setting out objectivity as one of the principles of information relations see paragraph below the court said that the implementation of that principle in respect of value judgments meant that they had to have a basis freedom of the press and protection offered to elements of provocation in journalistic expression could not justify baseless criticism with insulting elements as had occurred in the casev that position was in accordance with the caselaw of the european court of human rights in lingens v austria july series a no it had stressed the need to distinguish between facts and value judgments the truth of which was not susceptible of proof at the same time the district court stressed the following quote from the same paragraph of lingens the court notes in this connection that the facts on which mr lingens founded his valuejudgment were undisputed as was also his good faithvi the district court went on to note that the defendants had failed to provide proof that the facts which the journalist evaluated in the impugned article were undisputedincontrovertible доказів незаперечності оцінених журналістом фактів у даній справі відповідачі суду не надали and therefore the court did not consider that they had acted in good faith in accordance with article of the information act the court concluded that the defendants intention was not to inform the public but rather to spread negative information about the plaintiffvii the court refused to declare statement b defamatory on november the zaporizhzhya regional court of appeal upheld the judgment but modified it to the effect that damages were to be paid to i and not the orphanage since domestic law did not allow for the possibility of directing the funds awarded to a plaintiff to a third party charitable institution the court of appeal agreed with the lower courts assessment of the amount of damages account being taken of the plaintiffs moral suffering and disruption of his social ties including as a public official the firstinstance court had not established that the journalist had acted in good faith and checked the information she disseminated and accordingly no exemption from liability under the state support of media act applied see paragraph below the court of appeal stated that an insult was a statement which was uttered not with the aim of disseminating information but with the aim of humiliating a person on december the

46,the applicants were born in and respectively and live in lecco the first applicant is the editor of a local online newspaper in the province of lecco the other two applicants are journalists working for the newspaper in the course of their activities the applicants used radio equipment to access frequencies used by the police or the carabinieri this enabled them to learn of any communications transmitted in that way so that they could arrive quickly on the scene when wishing to report on specific incidents on august the applicants listened in on a conversation during which the merate carabinieri operations centre decided to send a patrol to a location where according to anonymous sources weapons had been stored illegally the carabinieri accordingly went to the location mentioned and the second and third applicants arrived on the scene immediately afterwards having obtained a search warrant the carabinieri searched the applicants car finding two frequencymodulation transmitterreceivers that were capable of intercepting police radio communications the carabinieri then went to the two journalists editorial office and seized two fixed radio receivers which were tuned to the frequencies used by the carabinieri other frequencies used by police operations centres were stored in the devices memory a the criminal proceedings against the applicants at first instance criminal proceedings were instituted against the first and second applicants for illegally installing equipment designed to intercept communications between lawenforcement agencies operations centres and patrols articles bis and bis of the criminal code the third applicant was charged with accessing the aforementioned communications articles and bis of the criminal code on november the lecco district court acquitted the applicants it held that the relevant articles of the criminal code were to be interpreted in the light of article of the constitution which only protected communications of a confidential nature the district court observed that the radio device used by the lawenforcement agencies was unable to ensure the confidentiality of the information it transmitted accordingly the interception of the communications in question did not constitute an offence moreover the possession and use of radio receivers were not prohibited as such b proceedings on appeal the milan principal public prosecutor and the lecco public prosecutor appealed they argued that the lecco district courts interpretation was inconsistent with the court of cassations caselaw in such matters citing in particular judgment no of january and that the communications in issue were clearly confidential bearing in mind the aims of ensuring public safety and protecting public order in addition the communications concerned the initial investigations following the commission of an offence they were therefore subject to a confidentiality requirement pursuant to article of the code of criminal procedure the confidential nature of the communications was also obvious from the fact that the carabinieri used coded language for communications concerning the location and the type of intervention clearly seeking to ensure that no third parties had knowledge of the information being exchanged in addition the radiofrequencies involved had been exclusively assigned to operations centres by the ministry of defence furthermore in order to listen in on the conversations the applicants had had to purchase special radio equipment as ordinary equipment could not be used for this purpose on the other hand the fact that such devices were freely available on the market did not justify their use for intercepting conversations between lawenforcement officers in addition in accordance with presidential decree no as in force at the material time devices of this kind were intended to be purchased by amateur radio operators but could not be used to intercept police radiofrequencies lastly the ministry of communications decree of february had expressly prohibited amateur radio operators from intercepting communications which they were not entitled to receive c judgment of the milan court of appeal in a judgment of may the milan court of appeal found the first and second applicants guilty and sentenced them to one year and three months imprisonment the third applicant was sentenced to six months imprisonment the court of appeal suspended the applicants sentences it observed that article bis of the criminal code as amended by law no of november had extended the scope of criminal responsibility to cover all remote data transmission thus including the interception of conversations between the lawenforcement agencies operations centres and patrols such communications were moreover clearly confidential reiterating all the arguments put forward by the milan and lecco public prosecutors particularly regarding the aims of ensuring public safety and protecting public order the court of appeal held that article of the code of criminal procedure was also at issue in the present case d proceedings in the court of cassation the applicants appealed to the court of cassation they contended that the communications in question had been transmitted on unencrypted frequencies and thus could not be treated as confidential furthermore they had been acting in a professional capacity as journalists and their actions were therefore justified under article of the criminal code and in terms of freedom of the press in a judgment of october the court of cassation found against the applicants upholding the court of appeals position as to the confidential nature of the communications and reiterating that this interpretation was consistent with its own approach in similar cases particularly in judgments no of may and no of january addressing the applicants argument concerning freedom of the press the court of cassation stated that the right to impart information which they had relied on might have prevailed over the public interests protected by criminal law in a case of alleged defamation however that right could not take precedence in a case concerning the illegal interception of communications between lawenforcement officers the,,,
47,the applicant was born in and lives in cluj napoca he is a university professor and contributor to various magazines and newspapers mainly of an economic and financial nature at the time of the relevant events he had already published more than articles in various local or national publications prior to parliamentary elections held at the end of november the applicant wrote an article about mii who was standing as a candidate for one of the national parties the article headlined attention he also wants to be in parliament was published on the front page of f a newspaper on november it read as follows after five rounds of free parliamentary elections ordinary people who are politically active only when they vote have come to an uncontroversial conclusion there is something wrong with people who become candidates for various political functions without even knowing exactly what is wrong most people of good moral and professional character often choose not to vote any more they make that choice especially when they learn that the person appearing on the electoral poster asking for votes has never done anything remarkable in his or her profession it is therefore no longer surprising that the romanian parliament is the institution that enjoys the least public confidence time has consolidated the publics belief that most candidates want to become parliamentarians so that they can for a couple of years take advantage of the privileges they grant themselves or of those informal benefits which come through the development of the system of relationships associated with their functions there are candidates who do everything to become parliamentarians in order to shield their criminal record from the criminal acts they committed before becoming senators or deputies among the many cases of that type i today present you one and if i do this it is not to help the voters because imposture by an individual reveals itself without reserve to the perceptive masses whereas one by a group or party does not especially when one can use all the presidential and municipal logistical powers impressive amounts of funds and an unsuspected power to persuade individuals with little training one such case is that of mr mii this gentleman is in good physical condition especially after living a comfortable life as a manager at r cluj a public company and now wants to use his skills in parliament and he does not intend to reach such a position only based on his wellknown lucidity but also with the help of some financial support for the intellectual efforts he wishes to make for the benefit of the many for that purpose he borrowed billion romanian lei for a period of months namely until october to invest on the stock market and earn a bit more than the creditor would request as interest based on perfectly legal documents it is just that at one point the moral profile of this representative of the democratic party of cluj showed itself clearly not having made as much profit as he hoped the candidate mii decided not to repay the loan thus contracted after imploring the creditor to have mercy to postpone and not enforce the contract even though he knows that the contract weighs against him he is relying on that defect of romanian justice of postponing the adjudication of cases in fact mr mii brought a case before a court which had no jurisdiction to assess the case but he hopes in the near future to be able to invoke his immunity as a member elected by the nation just like his spiritual guardian who left us without a maritime fleet that is why i say that we must be careful about what mr mii signs and promises for the following day he might no longer admit to anything he may switch to another political party if he is given more he may even sell part of the electoral district where he ran and if nobody wants it he can go to smirnov because it is warmer in tiraspol than in huedin on april mii brought a civil action against the applicant he sought euros eur for nonpecuniary damage as the article had allegedly seriously affected his reputation and made him lose the election by approximately one hundred votes mii also complained about the publication by the applicant of another defamatory article on january which was in a similar vein he also complained about the distribution of leaflets before the election which had reproduced the contents of the article of november he alleged that all the material had been meant to discredit him as a candidate the applicant confirmed that he was the author of the article in question and that everything he had written had been true as proved by documents from the arbitration tribunal of the cluj chamber of commerce which would become available to the court he further denied contributing in any way to the publication or distribution of other articles and leaflets concerning mii on july the cluj napoca court of first instance allowed the claims lodged by mii and held that the article of november had contained defamatory statements about him it further held the applicant liable to pay eur for nonpecuniary damage and romanian lei ron in legal costs the court held that the applicant had not proved that his statements were true the procedure before the arbitration tribunal invoked by the applicant in his defence had concerned a commercial dispute between mii and the applicants brokerage company in which the claims of mii had been partially granted on april as the repayment deadline had been set for april the court considered that even if true the applicants statements had been defamatory and should not have been made public in the media especially since they concerned matters of a private commercial nature the court further noted that the applicants statements had been reproduced in electoral leaflets which had been distributed in several public places in bus stations and private mailboxes the court held that even if it was not the applicant who had produced or distributed the leaflets there was a causal link between the publication of the article and the harm caused to miis reputation because if he had not produced his article in the first place there would have been no leaflets and no amplification of the negative effects on miis image the court then focused on the terms used by the applicant in his article in particular calling the defendant an impostor which was found to be insulting and lacking factual justification as there existed no criminal complaints of fraud against mii it concluded that the language used conveying the idea that mii would accept any compromise for money and would therefore betray the electorate his party and his country had exceeded the limits of admissible criticism and had disparaged him the applicant appealed arguing before the cluj county court that the publication of the article in question during a parliamentary election campaign had had the role of informing the public in good faith about a political figure in such a situation the limits of admissible criticism were wider he argued that during election campaigns the press had the essential role of informing the public about future members of the romanian parliament he argued that the amount of damages awarded by the firstinstance court had been disproportionate and had had an obvious punitive purpose in a final judgment of january the county court essentially upheld the reasoning of the lower court it considered that the manner in which the applicant had acted proved that he had not complied with the duties and responsibilities inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression the seriousness of his allegations and of the acts imputed to mii hold him the applicant responsible for showing the highest rigour and a special caution the lack of which would breach the rights of others the county court confirmed that the lower court had correctly estimated that it had been necessary to balance the right to private life on the one hand and freedom of expression which contributed to a debate of public interest on the other holding that to insult to defame a person can not be justified and legitimate when one party aims to unilaterally expose in the press private litigation of a commercial nature involving two private parties in assessing the existing conflict between the exercise of freedom of expression in the press and the necessity to protect the reputation and the rights of others the court estimates that even though the applicants allegations made in a press article during an electoral campaign concerned a potential member of the romanian parliament thus were of public interest there are limitations to freedom of expression the applicant having been bound to act within the limits given by the public interest in protecting the reputation and the rights of another person including his or her right to be presumed innocent undoubtedly when the article was published in the newspaper f the applicant did not comply with the minimum requirements of diligence prescribed by article of the convention in the sense of acting in good faith and in accordance with the journalistic ethics so as to ensure that the provided information be trustworthy notwithstanding the dose of exaggeration or provocation allowed in such situations nevertheless the county court allowed the applicants appeal in part and reduced the damages to eur considered to be more proportionate to the damage sustained by miiii relevant domestic law the relevant provisions of the romanian civil code in force at the time concerning tort liability are cited in ghiulfer predescu v romania no june the,,,

the ministry of foreign affairs and their co agent ms nina holst christensen from the ministry of justice the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows the applicant worked as a physician until around he founded an association called physicians in favour of euthanasia læger for aktiv dødshjælp for physicians aiming to have euthanasia made lawful in denmark in pursuance of this aim the applicant prepared a guide medicines suited for suicide lægemidler der er velegnede til selvmord available on the internet the guide combined a detailed procedure for how to commit suicide including a list of about common pharmaceuticals suited to committing suicide and a description of the dose required to go through with the suicide possible combinations of pharmaceuticals and caveats about the various pharmaceuticals the guide also provided advice on how a person could be assured of death by taking the recommended doses of medicines including by combining different pharmaceuticals or by taking a full dose of a pharmaceutical in combination with a plastic bag over the head and a rubber band around the neck it was lawful under danish law to publish such a guide on the internet or elsewhere on the basis of a radio interview with the applicant in february in which he stated inter alia that he had assisted a patient with a terminal pulmonary condition in dying by administering the pharmaceutical fenemal the patient safety authority styrelsen for patientsikkerhed reported the applicant to the police for violation of section of the penal code prohibiting assisted suicide moreover on march it withdrew the applicants doctors licence to practise with the consequence among other things that the applicant could no longer prescribe medications for himself or others subsequently the applicant was charged with two counts of assisted suicide and one count of attempt by a judgment of september the district court of svendborg retten i svendborg convicted the applicant of one count of assisted suicide and one count of attempt he was sentenced to days imprisonment suspended on appeal to the high court of eastern denmark østre landsret by a judgment of january the applicant was convicted of all three counts and sentenced to days imprisonment suspended on appeal to the supreme court højesteret on september the high court judgment was upheld more concretely in respect of count the applicant was convicted of attempted assisted suicide committed on march having together with a codefendant prescribed medications for a who wanted to commit suicide the suicide attempt had failed the applicant stated that a had contacted him and told him that he suffered from neurological diseases the applicant had spoken to a several times on the telephone and they had also communicated by email the applicant had asked the codefendant to prescribe fenemal for a the applicant had known that a would use the medication to commit suicide the codefendant confirmed the correctness of this statement and explained that he had been contacted by the applicant who had asked him to prescribe fenemal for a as the applicant could not prescribe any medications himself because his doctors licence to practise had been withdrawn a confirmed that he had been in contact with the applicant who had helped him obtain the required medication since his attempted suicide a had received medications for his physical pain and his anxiety and his condition had therefore improved in respect of count the applicant was convicted of assisted suicide committed in the spring of having prior to bs death dispensed a dose of fenemal to him knowing full well that it was intended for his suicide b had become paralysed in most of his body following a stroke he no longer found life worth living and wanted to die the applicant stated that he had visited b and advised him how to commit suicide in accordance with the guide that he had uploaded to the internet subsequently he had discussed with another person whether it was possible to procure pills for b but he did not know whether that person had ever supplied the pills the applicant had not himself provided any medication for b according to the statement given by bs former wife b had tried to be allowed to go to switzerland for euthanasia however no psychiatrists would issue a medical certificate saying that b was mentally prepared as required by the swiss authorities bs former wife had then contacted the applicant asking him to help b they had met with the applicant who had indicated that he could establish contact with someone who could procure the medication subsequently bs former wife had received a supply for b which she handed over to b who had later stated that he now had what he needed in may the family had had a farewell dinner with b and the next day bs former wife had received a telephone call from the nursing home and been told that b was fast asleep and that it was not possible to waken him up b had passed away a couple of days later in respect of count the applicant was convicted of assisted suicide committed between july and august c was years old she suffered from many infirmities but was not seriously ill she wished to end her life and had procured the necessary pills herself on july she had contacted the applicant by email and asked for his assistance the applicant and c had exchanged at least nine emails between july and august on july the applicant had asked c which medication she had procured on july the applicant had confirmed that the medications at her disposal were excellent and also recommended that she look at the general guide on how to commit suicide which was available on the website of the network on july he was helping her finding the general guide on august he confirmed that it was a good idea to combine the medication with a plastic bag over her head in which connection he had written if you are able to go through with it you will be certain remember in that case that it is necessary to put a rubber band around the neck on august c had been found dead in her bed with a plastic bag over her head in its judgment of september the supreme court stated liability for assisted suicide or attempts at assisted suicide by the high court judgment the applicant was found guilty on two counts of violation of section of the penal code for assisted suicide and one count of an attempt at assisted suicide this case concerns whether according to the findings of fact of the high court the acts performed by the applicant as described in the three counts are punishable because they are considered assistance as set out in the provision and whether the conditions for imposing a sentence for the attempt have been met in that case there is also the issue of the length of the sentence it is a punishable offence under section of the penal code to assist another person in ending his or her life but it is not a punishable offence to attempt to take ones own life accordingly this provision independently criminalises assisted suicide the supreme court finds that it will be determined based on an interpretation of this provision what kinds of assistance fall within the scope of the liability for which reason it is not possible simply to use as a basis those kinds of complicity that are punishable under the general rule of law set out in section of the penal code as complicity in offences minor assistance may fall outside the scope of criminal offences under section as regards count the applicant has been found guilty of violation of section of the penal code because he procured medications for b prior to bs death on may knowing full well that the medications were intended for his suicide as regards count the applicant has been found guilty of attempted violation of section because he procured medications for a knowing full well that the medications were intended for as suicide which suicide failed however the supreme court concurs in the finding that the applicants acts as described in count and count are punishable as assisted suicide as set out in section of the penal code as regards count the supreme court concurs in the finding that the conditions for sentencing someone for an attempt have been met as the maximum penalty under section of a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years makes it possible to sanction attempts see section of the penal code the applicants submission concerning the legislative history of section can not lead to a different conclusion as regards count the applicant has been found guilty of having in emails exchanged with c advised her about suicide methods including by confirming the choice of medications and by confirming that it was a good idea to combine them with a plastic bag and by writing if you are able to go through with it you will be certain remember in that case that it is necessary to put a rubber band around the neck thereby he assisted her in committing suicide by taking medicines and putting a plastic bag over her head and closing it with a rubber band opinion of three judges concerning count we concur in the finding that by giving advice in his email exchange with c the applicant assisted her in a specific and significant way in committing suicide and that the advice is not exempt from punishment due to the circumstance that his advice was based on a general guide that had lawfully been uploaded to the website of physicians in favour of euthanasia in this context we have also taken into account that the specific advice offered by the applicant to c was suited to a greater extent than the general guide to intensifying her desire to commit suicide in our opinion there is no basis for finding that it would be contrary to article of the european convention on human rights to convict the defendant on this count opinion of two judges concerning count it appears from the case file that c contacted the applicant in july and indicated in her emails that she was years old and suffered from many infirmities that she wished to end soon and that things had been clarified with her close family she had procured the necessary pills and her intention was also to combine them with a plastic bag she was very frightened of the potential risk that she would fail and she was nervous as to whether she would be able to go through with it on her own the applicant then passed on information from the lawful guide on the website but he did not pass on any information not already available from the website he neither advocated nor encouraged her to commit suicide in these circumstances we find that the information given by the applicant to c was not of such a nature that the information can independently be considered to constitute a punishable act of assistance in her ending her life accordingly we find that the applicant must be acquitted on this count of violation of section of the penal code which must also be considered to accord best with article of the european convention on human rights on the right to receive and give information see in this respect the judgment delivered on october by the european court of human rights in cases and open door and dublin well woman v ireland the supreme court by a majority of three judges sentenced the applicant to days imprisonment suspended it was taken into account as an aggravating circumstance that to a certain extent the acts were committed in a systematic manner and that the applicant had been charged on three counts the last act being committed after he had been provisionally charged by the police for violation of section of the penal code it was considered a mitigating circumstance that the applicant was almost years old the minority of two judges found that the applicant should have a suspended sentence of imprisonment for a term of days since count was merely an attempt and under count he had not assisted to a significant extent moreover the minority of the judges found that the acts had not been committed in a systematic manner relevant legal framework and practice the relevant provisions of the penal code straffeloven read as follows section acts aimed at inciting or assisting the commission of an offence are punishable as attempts if the offence is not completed the penalty prescribed for an offence may be reduced for attempts especially where an attempt reflects little strength or persistence of criminal intent unless otherwise provided attempts will only be punished if the offence is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding four months section the penalty provided for an offence applies to everybody who is complicit in the act by incitement aiding or abetting the punishment may be reduced where a person intended only to provide minor assistance or support an intent already formed and where the offence has not been completed or intentional complicity failed the punishment may also be reduced where a person is complicit in the breach of a special duty to which he is not subject unless otherwise provided the punishment for complicity in offences that do not carry a sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding four months may be remitted where the accomplice intended only to provide minor assistance or support an intent already formed and where his complicity was due to negligence section any person who kills another at such other persons explicit request is sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years section any person who assists someone in deliberately ending his life is sentenced to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years assisted suicide has been criminalised since section of the penal code was given its current wording by act no of march in november the ministry of justice requested the standing committee on the criminal code straffelovrådet which is an advisory body tasked with making recommendations on legislative issues related to criminal law issues of principle relating to the stipulation of administrative criminal law provisions and the implementation in practice of crime policy measures to consider the issue of whether to criminalise also general encouragement of suicide or suicide recipes not aimed at specific persons in its report no the said committee did not recommend the criminalisation of general encouragement to suicide in respect of the scope of section of the penal code it stated as follows it is not a punishable offence to attempt to take ones own life but it is a punishable offence under section of the penal code to assist another person in ending his or her life the maximum sentence is a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years the offence is consummated when the victim dies depending on the circumstances it is possible to sentence a person for an attempt at assisting another person in ending his or her life see section read with section of the penal code attempts comprise any act aimed at inciting or assisting in the commission of an offence see pp ff of the annotated criminal code den kommenterede straffelov on general rules the question is whether section only applies to physical and mental assistance of a qualified nature or whether in accordance with the general danish law rule on complicity set out in section of the penal code the provision also applies if the offender by incitement aiding or abetting deliberately assists a particular person in committing suicide see pp ff on general rules and p on special rules of the annotated criminal code for an act to be punishable under section it is required in any circumstances that the offender must have performed a specific act of assistance with the intent that one or more specific persons commit suicide encouragement of suicide and descriptions of methods to commit suicide do not fall within the scope of section if not directed at specific persons therefore the presentation or dissemination of suicide recipes through internet websites or the like can not normally be punished under section as mentioned above a person can be sentenced for assistance under section of the criminal code only if the purpose of the offence of assistance is a specific act of assistance the issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide has regularly been the subject of public and political debate in denmark but so far there has not been a political majority in parliament in favour of amending section of the penal code the issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide has also been considered by the council of ethics det etiske råd the council of ethics is an independent body established in to advise parliament ministers and public authorities on ethical issues in health care while respecting the integrity and dignity of humans and future generations in and the council of ethics published reports and recommendations on euthanasia and assisted suicide a large majority of the seventeen members of the council was against the legalisation of euthanasia and assisted suicide in all three reports the council has balanced the considerations on the one hand factors like the right to personal autonomy and on the other hand factors like the sanctity of human life as a fundamental ethical standard and the incompatibility of euthanasia with an ethically appropriate relationship between a physician and a patient the danish council of ethics discussed the subject again in on the basis of a judgment delivered by the german federal constitutional court in february which had ruled that the maintenance of a prohibition of assisted suicide was unconstitutional in parliament amended the danish health care act sundhedsloven enhancing patients right to refuse treatment including lifesustaining treatment which means that a patient who has come to terms with circumstances and does not want any lifesustaining treatment can refuse the treatment offered even though the consequence of withdrawing from lifesustaining treatment is that the patient will die right away moreover a system of living wills has been set up under which individuals can make binding advance decisions to refuse lifesustaining treatment in specific situations that may occur some time in the future if they become permanently incompetent and are no longer able to exercise their right to personal autonomy prior to the adoption of the amendment bill it was discussed at the readings in parliament what is a dignified death and what is the right to personal autonomy and it was discussed that it must be ensured that health care professionals can discontinue lifesustaining treatment without fearing being charged with homicide on request finally in december all parties in parliament concluded a political agreement to roll out an it system that was to support a future right of elderly feeble citizens to ask their physician to write a donotresuscitate order in the event that they suffer from heart failure it is expected that a bill granting this right will be introduced in relevant international and european materials recommendation of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe recommended inter alia as follows paragraph that the committee of ministers encourage the member states of the council of europe to respect and protect the dignity of terminally ill or dying persons in all respectsc by upholding the prohibition against intentionally taking the life of terminally ill or dying persons whilei recognising that the right to life especially with regard to a terminally ill or dying person is guaranteed by the member states in accordance with article of the european convention on human rights which states that no one shall be deprived of his life intentionallyii recognising that a terminally ill or dying persons wish to die never constitutes any legal claim to die at the hand

50,the applicant was born in and lives in toruń the applicant is a publicist and a professor of sociology a the statement in issue on january rzeczpospolita a national daily newspaper published an article titled zybertowicz so far to the third polish republic zybertowicz na razie dla iii rp the article contained information about three civil lawsuits against the applicant instituted by am the editorinchief of one of the biggest daily newspapers gazeta wyborcza and a certain ms and zs the article also included a comment by the applicant on the lawsuits in question in a way it is quite interesting to note who has lodged civil claims against me so far two agents and one their fierce defender swoją drogą to ciekawe kto mnie dotychczas pozwał do sądu dwóch agentów i jeden ich zaciekły obrońca b civil proceedings against the applicant on march am brought a civil action in the warsaw regional court sąd okręgowy requesting legal protection of his personal rights he asked that the applicant be ordered to publish an apology and to pay damages of polish zlotys pln approximately euros eur to a charity on april the warsaw regional court transferred the case to the toruń regional court on august the warsaw court of appeal sąd apelacyjny quashed this decision on june the warsaw regional court gave judgment and partly allowed the plaintiffs claim it ordered the applicant to publish an apology on the first second or third page of rzeczpospolita it further determined the exact size and wording of the apology the court also ordered the applicant to pay pln approximately eur to a charity and pln approximately eur in court fees during the proceedings the court questioned the applicant and the plaintiff the applicant argued that the phrase in question had represented his opinion about ams public statements referring to several published statements and excerpts from articles written by am the applicant claimed that he had had a good factual basis for giving this opinion of ams views about lustration the court also obtained an opinion from an expert on linguistics the expert was asked in particular to reply to the question of whether the phrase two agents and one their fierce defender in the context of the case constituted a statement of fact or an opinion in his opinion of may the expert stated that the phrase in question had been a statement of fact and not a hypothesis or supposition in addition taking into account the readers presumed general knowledge it was obvious that am had been identified in the article as having defended two agents the plaintiff submitted to the court a second expert report dated january in which another expert on language analysis confirmed that the applicants statement had been a statement of fact the warsaw regional court noted that the applicant when formulating the statement in question referred in particular to a number of published statements made by am in which he had criticised the lustration law the applicant also relied on an earlier warsaw court of appeal judgment confirming that zs had indeed collaborated under communism with the security service the court further held that everyone including those not following the news carefully was aware that ms and zs had been accused of collaborating with the security service in particular readers of rzeczpospolita should have been aware of that fact as the newspaper had published numerous articles on the issue the warsaw regional court also held that judging by both the applicants statement and the whole article it did not appear that am had been an agent while the applicant in his statement had not specified who in his opinion had been an agent and who their fierce defender from the nature of the publication and taking into account the readers general knowledge it was clear that it was the plaintiff who was considered to be the fierce defender of two agents at the same time the court accepted that had the applicant used a more general formulation and referred only to ams attitude towards the lustration law such words could have fallen within the limits of acceptable criticism and it would not have been necessary to protect ams personal rights lastly the court considered that from the published statements and quotes from ams public statements which the applicant had submitted during the proceedings it did not appear that am had ever actually defended those two particular persons in conclusion the court held that ams personal rights had been breached but only partially for this reason the court considered that the plaintiffs claim had been exaggerated therefore it lowered the sum to be paid to the charity both parties appealed on march the warsaw court of appeal modified the firstinstance judgment and ordered the applicant to pay pln approximately eur to the charity and pln approximately eur in court fees the applicant was also ordered to publish an apology in rzeczpospolita the court in principle agreed with the reasoning presented by the regional court it held that while the phrase fierce defender of two agents had breached ams personal rights it was not defamatory the court further agreed with the regional court that the applicant had named am as having defended two particular persons however he had failed to prove that his statement had been true consequently the court considered that the phrase used by the applicant had breached the plaintiffs personal rights in particular his good name and had conflicted with the values espoused by him the court referred to the ongoing public debate in poland about the necessity of lustration in order to explain and disclose the role of various special services after the world war ii it noted that in the context of that debate the phrase that someone was a fierce defender of agents suggested that that person had defended them justified their actions and searched for a way to absolve them from any responsibility in the eyes of the public consequently attributing to someone the role of fierce defender of agents was a breach of that persons good name and suggested that that persons behaviour had been contrary to the public good the court also held that the phrase in question had been a statement of fact however it considered that there had been no basis for concluding that am had defended any agents or more generally defended activities of the communist secret services that had been harmful to the public on the contrary he had firmly condemned such activities he had objected to lustration being understood as a tool to destroy people and being used as an argument in political games with reference to the sum to be paid to the charity the court noted that the applicant was a highly educated university professor holding numerous public offices a person in the applicants situation should have been aware of how his statement would have been understood by an average reader of rzeczpospolita and whether there was any basis for attributing to someone the role of fierce defender of agents the court further held that the sum of pln to be paid to charity was symbolic and that pln was a more appropriate sum given the circumstances of the case especially considering that it was not an excessive burden for the applicant the applicant lodged a cassation appeal in particular he referred to article of the convention on march the supreme court sąd najwyższy refused to entertain the applicants cassation appeal on account of the lack of important legal issues to be considered in the case the court relying on article of the convention noted that freedom of expression did not have an absolute character it further referred to its own caselaw according to which the necessity to prove that a statement of fact was true was not an excessive requirement and did not infringe the freedom of political debate c enforcement proceedings on april ams representative instituted enforcement proceedings in the warsaw district court aimed at compelling the applicant to comply with the obligations imposed by the warsaw court of appeals judgment of march on june the warsaw district court ordered the applicant to publish the apology ordered by the warsaw court of appeal in rzeczpospolita after the applicant failed to comply with that order on june the warsaw district court allowed am to publish the apology in rzeczpospolita in the applicants name and ordered him to cover the fee for its publication in the amount of pln approximately eur the applicant received a significant discount on that fee ii

51,the applicant was born in and lives in warsaw a background to the case in the applicant who is a journalist published a book entitled gazeta wyborcza beginnings and beyond gazeta wyborcza początki i okolice the book relates in an unfavourable light the story of the founding of gazeta wyborcza one of the best known polish daily newspapers with a nationwide distribution the newspaper was founded in in the wake of the socalled round table talks between the communist government and the heads of the then democratic opposition which ultimately led to the first semifree elections in poland since and to the ultimate dismantling of the communist regime by the end of the second edition of the applicants book was published in no reviews of the book were published in the press subsequently the applicant requested seven daily and weekly newspapers to publish an identical paid advertisement for the book the text of the proposed advertisement reads as follows it does not make for pleasant reading for the editorinchief of gazeta wyborcza friends the truth about gazeta wyborcza previously unseen documents and new witnesses stanisław remuszko a former journalist at the newspaper today working freelance has written the first ever book in poland europe and the world about gazeta wyborcza and its background do you have the faintest idea where the wealth of gazeta wyborcza comes from information available at wwwremuszkopl all the newspapers nasz dziennik wprost metropol newsweek polityka and rzeczpospolita refused to publish the advertisement gazeta polska was the first to agree to publish it and they signed a contract with the applicant however shortly afterwards the editor changed his mind refused publication and reimbursed the money paid by the applicant on june the applicant lodged seven identical claims with the warsaw regional court against the newspapers he requested that the court order the defendant newspapers to publish the advertisements the applicant referred to section of the press act see paragraph below arguing that nothing in the advertisement as proposed could reasonably be construed as being in breach of the law or third parties personal rights or contrary to the editorial policy of the defendants unless they considered that their editorial policy included a duty to protect the interests of gazeta wyborcza its editorinchief and publisher the applicant referred to article of the constitution and to section of the press act the warsaw regional court by judgments dated january may may january and march dismissed his actions against nasz dziennik wprost metropol newsweek and polityka respectively the applicant appealed by judgments of december and june the warsaw court of appeal allowed his appeals and ordered the defendant newspapers wprost and metropol to publish the advertisement concerned no appeal was lodged against those judgments during the appellate proceedings against nasz dziennik the warsaw court of appeal decided on october to make use of article of the code of civil procedure and put a legal question to the supreme court concerning the interpretation of article of the press act the supreme court refused to reply to this question by way of a decision of october czp see relevant domestic law and practice below on march the warsaw court of appeal rejected the applicants appeal against newsweek on formal grounds failure to pay the court fee by a judgment of april the warsaw court of appeal dismissed the applicants appeal against polityka by a judgment of july the warsaw regional court allowed the claim against gazeta polska the editors appealed the parties settled the case before the court of appeal the applicant submits that ultimately the advertisement was not published b the proceedings against rzeczpospolita the present case concerns the proceedings against rzeczpospolita and its editorinchief by a judgment of march the warsaw regional court dismissed the applicants claim it referred to section of the press act noting that the only requirements that paid advertisements to be published in the press had to comply with were the laws and principles of social coexistence zasady współżycia społecznego the editors of rzeczpospolita had been aware of the content of the book publishing the advertisement could have been regarded as endorsing that content which in turn could have been seen as breaching the personal rights of third parties this could have given rise to civil liability on their part not only were the editors allowed to refuse publication of an advertisement in breach of third parties rights they were even obliged to do so the applicant appealed referring to his right to freedom of expression he also argued that the firstinstance court had failed to provide any explanation as to why and how the advertisement breached third parties rights the warsaw court of appeal by a judgment of november allowed his appeal and remitted the case for reexamination the court first held that publication of advertisements was not covered by freedom of expression it further accepted the applicants argument about the lower courts failure to give adequate reasons for its judgment that court had held that the text of the advertisement was in breach of the law and third parties personal rights without adducing any arguments or reasons for that view the court further observed that the lower court had made its assessment with reference to the content of the book concerned this was not correct as under section of the press act lawfulness andor respect for third parties personal rights had to be examined with reference to the content of the advertisement only and not of the advertised service or the merchandise the content of the book was irrelevant in the case at hand by a judgment of january the warsaw regional court dismissed the applicants claim the court was of the view that the advertisement was incompatible with the newspapers editorial profile it further reiterated that the publication of the advertisement could have been understood as an endorsement of the applicants views expressed in the book this circumstance alone was sufficient to justify the refusal to publish the advertisement moreover rzeczpospolita and gazeta wyborcza were competitors in the press market the publication of the advertisement could have given rise to a suspicion that the editors of the former were trying to denigrate the latter in the eyes of the public further the editors were not obliged by law to endorse the dissemination of views and statements which they did not accept the court concluded that the advertisement did not meet the requirements laid down by section of the press act the court further stated referring to the views expressed by the supreme court in its judgments of january given in other cases brought by the applicant and concerning refusals to publish the same advertisement see paragraph below that the principle of commercial and contractual freedom dictated that a publisher was not under a legal obligation to publish all advertisements submitted to it because it did not have a monopoly on the market the applicant appealed reiterating his earlier arguments he expressly relied on article of the convention on february the warsaw court of appeal dismissed his appeal essentially endorsing the view expressed by the regional court the applicants lawyer submitted a cassation appeal against that judgment to the supreme court relying on the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by the constitution and by article of the convention by a judgment of march served on the applicant on june the supreme court dismissed the cassation appeal the court referred to its judgments given in other cases initiated by the applicant czp the nasz dziennik case in which it refused to answer a legal question see paragraph below i csk and the polityka case it observed that the press market was governed by business and commercial freedom it resulted therefrom that publishers of newspapers could not be held to be obliged to publish all advertisements simply at the request of clients the court referred to the courts judgment in the case of appleby and others v the united kingdom no echr vii it shared the courts view that the principles governing the exercise of the freedom of expression were also applicable to commercial speech however it did not necessarily result therefrom that in horizontal relations this freedom could not be limited in compliance with the constitutional principle of proportionality whereas it was true that section paragraph of the press act could not be said to be fully consistent with other provisions of that act it could validly be relied on by publishers wishing to refuse the publication of an advertisement if they were of the view that the advertisement as proposed was not compatible with the newspapers profile the supreme court concluded that the contested judgment was ultimately in conformity with the law ii relevant domestic law and practice article of the constitution provides freedom to express opinions and to acquire and disseminate information shall be ensured to everyone preventive censorship of means of social communication and licensing of the press shall be prohibited article of the constitution reads freedom of the person shall receive legal protection everyone shall respect the freedoms and rights of others no one shall be compelled to do that which is not required by law any limitation upon the exercise of constitutional freedoms and rights may be imposed only by statute and only when necessary in a democratic state for the protection of its security or public order or to protect the natural environment health or public morals or the freedoms and rights of other persons such limitations shall not violate the essence of freedoms and rights section of the press act reads as follows the press may publish paid advertisements and notices press advertisements shall not be in breach of the laws or of the principles of social coexistence advertisements shall be put in such a form as to make it clear that they are not to be identified with the editorial content the publisher and editor shall have the right to refuse the publication of an advertisement if its content or form is incompatible with the editorial profile or character of the newspaper in a decision of october czp the supreme court examined a legal question submitted to it by the warsaw court of appeal in the applicants case against nasz dziennik in its request the court of appeal summarised the difficulties arising in connection with the interpretation of section of the press act on the one hand section provided in paragraph that newspaper publishers had a right to publish advertisements this formulation suggested that they were free to decide on the choice of advertisement to be published on the other hand the provisions of paragraphs and of that section in so far as they defined situations where a publisher could refuse to publish an advertisement suggested that such refusal was possible only where that advertisement as proposed failed to meet the requirements laid down in those provisions otherwise publishers were obliged under the provisions to publish an advertisement as long as it had been duly paid for this conclusion was further strengthened by the fact that under paragraph of section of the act publishers did not bear any legal responsibility for the content of paid advertisements the court of appeal noted in its question that the freedom of expression of the person trying to place an advertisement had to be weighed against the publishers commercial freedom it further observed that if decisive weight was given to the publishers freedom to choose the advertisements to be published a form of unlimited control of content by private commercial entities could result comparable to preventive censorship the supreme court endorsed the reasoning of the requesting court that section of the press act could and indeed did give rise to discrepancies in its judicial interpretation a literal interpretation a contrario indicated that a refusal to publish an advertisement was justified only when one of the four conditions laid down in paragraphs and was not fulfilled had the legislator accepted that publishers were completely free in deciding whether to publish an advertisement or to refuse its publication it would have been redundant to list the requirements that an advertisement had to comply with in order to be published hence the majority of legal writers were of the view which was apparently also shared by the requesting court of appeal that this provision of the press act limited the publishers freedom in respect of commercial advertisements the supreme court expressed the view that it was difficult to accept such an opinion it observed that many arguments could be adduced in support of a contrary opinion however in the circumstances of the case it was not necessary for that court to give a reply to the legal question posed by the court of appeal as such a reply was not necessary for a decision on the merits of the case the outcome of the case pending before the court of appeal hinged only on that courts assessment of whether the advertisement as proposed was in breach of the applicable law not on the clarification of the scope of the publishers duty to publish a paid advertisement the supreme court made similar observations as to the interpretation of section of the press act in its two judgments given on january concerning the applicants cases i csk and the applicants claim to have the advertisement published was rejected in both cases the,,,
52,the applicant was born in and lives in vienna at the time of the events the applicant worked for the association asyl in not which offers legal and social support to asylum seekers and refugees in an amendment to a number of laws concerning the status of foreigners and of asylum seekers and concerning relevant proceedings fremdenrechtspaket was drafted and adopted by parliament the amendments entered into force on january on december the then federal minister for interior affairs lp died unexpectedly of an aneurysm at the age of on january the applicant published a statement on the associations website entitled one less whats coming now eine weniger was kommt danach it continued the good news for the new year lp minister for torture and deportation is dead die gute meldung zum jahresbeginn lp bundesministerin für folter und deportation ist tot after referring to some specific individual stories of asylum seekers the text stated further that mrs p was a desk war criminal just like many others there have been in the atrocious history of this country completely desensitised indifferent to the consequences of their laws and regulations the compliant instrument of a bureaucracy contaminated with racism no decent human is shedding tears over her death lp war eine schreibtischtäterin wie es viele gab in der grausamen geschichte dieses landes völlig abgestumpft gleichgültig gegen die folgen ihrer gesetze und erlässe ein willfähiges werkzeug einer rassistisch verseuchten beamtenschaft kein anständiger mensch weint ihr eine träne nach the applicant concluded the text by suggesting that their goal for the new year was to fight for a new minister who would make good the damage done by lp so that austria could return to being a country welcoming asylum seekers and a place where human rights were respected gp the late ministers husband filed a private prosecution privatanklage for defamation against the applicant and the association on september the vienna regional court landesgericht für strafsachen wien convicted the applicant of defamation in respect of the abovequoted passages of the statement and sentenced him to a fine in the amount of eur half of the fine was suspended for three years it dismissed gps request for recognition of the associations liability for its employees actions the court found that the average reader would understand the relevant passages of the statement to mean that lp had ordered or tolerated the torture pending expulsion or the deportation of detainees and had violated human rights the word torture in particular implied the intentional infliction of physical or psychological suffering an average reader would also place the word deportation deportation in the context of the historical events under the nationalsocialist regime which forcefully deported segregated groups of people to ghettos and camps to subject them to forced labour or extermination the statement in question suggested that lp exercised her political function in a particularly despicable way that she was indifferent to officials criminal abuse of authority in relation to asylum seekers and that her actions were motivated by racist sadistic xenophobic and nationalsocialist attitudes the publication of the statement had triggered considerable reaction from the media and the public the applicant had been criticised as tactless and disrespectful in response thereto on january the applicant published in a daily newspaper a reply in which he stated that his comments had been directed solely towards lp and he apologised to her family members who were not responsible for the late ministers inhumane policies the regional court acknowledged that a criminal charge of defamation was at odds with the right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by the convention it found that the voicing of opinions by refugee associations criticising politicians and their legislative projects represented an important corrective element and that the limits of acceptable criticism were particularly widely drawn in the context of the present case however in the courts opinion the published statement overstepped the limits of acceptable criticism the legislative background to the amendment of the laws governing foreigners and asylum seekers and the fact that criticism was allowed to be shocking still could not justify positioning lp in a nationalsocialist and racist context and suggesting that she had tolerated the intentional physical illtreatment of detainees pending expulsion or deportations such accusations against the then only recently passed away lp together with the acclamation of her death and the call on decent people not to mourn her passing clearly went beyond the limits of acceptable criticism in a democratic society moreover the allegations made by the applicant had not been proven to be true nor had he shown any journalistic diligence in that regard the applicant filed an appeal on points of law and fact and also appealed against the sentence on may the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht wien dismissed his appeal referring to the reasoning of the firstinstance court it conceded that the word deportation nowadays had acquired the additional meaning of expulsion or removal and was not only used in the context of the nationalsocialist regime but also in the context of the forced expulsion of foreigners however the context of the word in which it had been used a desk war criminal just like many others there have been in the atrocious history of this country acted as a reminder of the nationalsocialist history of the country therefore even though the statements at issue were political value judgments politische wertungen the applicant had not produced any proof of a factual basis for his allegations the applicant had further argued that following the caselaw of the european court of human rights and of the domestic courts with regard to article the impugned statement was covered by freedom of expression the court of appeal however found that even such caselaw did not provide carte blanche for the applicant to make comparisons with the nationalsocialist regime without any factual basis that decision was served on the applicants counsel on june on november the applicant lodged a request for the renewal of the criminal proceedings erneuerung des strafverfahrens pursuant to article a of the code of criminal procedure with the aim of having the proceedings reopened and the conviction set aside on october the supreme court dismissed the request it stated that the admittedly broad limits of tolerable criticism in the political discourse did not cover excessive value judgments without any factual basis statements made in even heated political conflicts needed to respect a minimum of decency and moderation in the present case the supreme court found that the evaluation by the courts had rightly led to the conclusion that the text in question justified the limitation of the applicants right to freedom of expression the value judgment suggesting criminal behaviour on the part of lp had no factual basis the courts had not misjudged the considerable public interest in the discussion concerning migration and asylum policy however the applicants statements had not contributed to that public discussion since they were directed at defaming and discrediting the late minister the court further noted that the sanction imposed was in view of the disrespectful statements and their temporal proximity to lps death appropriate and even moderate the supreme courts decision was served on the applicants counsel on november ii relevant domestic law article of the criminal code strafgesetzbuch defines defamation as follows as it may be perceived by a third party anyone who makes an accusation against another of having a contemptible character or attitude or of behaving contrary to honour or morality and of such a nature as to male him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six months or a fine the person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true as regards the offence as defined in paragraph he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to assume that the statement was true article of the criminal code strafgesetzbuch as in force until january read in the case of an offence under sections or of this criminal code committed against a deceased or missing person his or her spouse or close relatives or siblings shall be entitled to ask for prosecution the,,,
53,in and lives in bucharest the applicant was represented by mr cl popescu a lawyer practising in bucharest the government were represented successively by their agents ms c brumar mr v mocanu and ms sm teodoroiu of the romanian ministry of foreign affairs background to the case the applicant is a judge attached to the bucharest court of appeal in march the applicant wrote an article about the president of the court of cassation under the heading nothing about how a comrade prosecutor has become the president of all judges it read to my great grandfather no killed by the communists in when the communist camp was becoming more unbearable the current president of the court of cassation was appointed prosecutor in the town where i was born the town had a steel industry and a shipyard and therefore was crawling with members of the securitate from small informants to the most privileged and smooth torturers i was twelve years old and i was in the sixth grade because she was almost always at work and in order to spend as much time as possible with us my mother used to take me and my younger brother to the parades on august once we were taken to a stadium to see nicolae ceauşescu who had travelled to our town by helicopter i remember that we stood for countless hours under the scorching sun there were many people in shabby clothes all of us were standing upright repeating the slogans next to me a woman was only mouthing the ovations because she was so tired so when i turned my head under the scorching sun i saw a man grabbing her arm and telling her discreetly to follow him only because she had mouthed the words i was no longer interested in seeing the great leader we left and after we had left the stadium well behind i kept asking my mum why meanwhile the president of the court of cassation was a rising prosecutor how did the comrade prosecutor fight to root out the enemies of the socialist order and for the pursuit of the new man naturally with her weapon the case files i started to imagine what could happen in the dungeons from where some came out dishonoured broken and scared and many did not come out alive who was hurting them what did those who got hurt and those who were hurting them looked like where are the marks even today there is no desire to find out afterwards in the seventh grade during my internship in agriculture i saw female detainees on the field where we were harvesting tomatoes they were wearing a thick uniform with a striped skirt and a scarf on their head i wanted to memorise one of their faces the detainee status seemed incompatible to me with being a woman they were crying and asking us to come near them as if we had been their own children other women appeared authoritarian dressed in uniforms fitted with leather belts my mum told me that many of them had been convicted for abortion women chose to kill their unborn because they did not have the means to raise them in addition to this internal turmoil they were being hunted down by the police miliție and the prosecutors how did the comrade prosecutor manage at that time naturally still for the pursuit of the new man for me the world that had already taken shape consisted of severe poverty the silence and terror from the earths surface and the unknown hell from the dungeons from where screams were never heard the prosecutors were somewhere above in an untouchable shining world which made it impossible to see the sky for all those in my world all these comrades usurpers of christ and his law sternly guarded the communist prison the comrade prosecutor has also floated above us omnipresent for fourteen years until when she transformed into a judge that is to say when i was twentysix years old during all this time i did my homework by candlelight the candle glued to the edge of a jarfood was rationed cold water only ran for two hours a day warm water was long gone we shivered with cold indoors we waited at bus stops until we were freezing and afterwards we were lucky if we found room on the buss footboard to go to school now i realise that all this time long as my entire childhood and adolescence has not been wasted because the comrade prosecutor has accomplished so much as to become the president of all judges herself the president of the country appointed her in in a european state where the justice system is continuously being reformed that is to say to the old man a new face that is why the result is and will be an eternal failure the applicants name was in the byline which also stated that she was a judge attached to the bucharest court of appeal the article was printed both in a national newspaper cotidianul and on an internet news site juridicero disciplinary and codeofconduct proceedings against the applicant disciplinary proceedings against the applicant on march the judicial investigation unit inspecția judiciară the ij attached to the superior council of the judiciary consiliul superior al magistraturii the csm opened a preliminary investigation against the applicant on its own motion on the grounds that the article published by her was referring to the professional career of the president of the court of cassation on april the ij produced a note concerning the article published by the applicant and proposed that the note be forwarded to the disciplinary commission for judges comisia de disciplină pentru judecători the cdj attached to the csm to establish whether a disciplinary investigation had to be opened against the applicant for breaching article a of law no concerning conduct of judges and prosecutors affecting their professional honour and dignity the ij held that the article had drawn a parallel between the oppressions of the communist regime and the rise of the president of the court of cassation who had worked as a prosecutor at that time judge lds had been appointed president of the court of cassation in lawfully after she had passed the lawfully required vetting process to ensure that she had not been a member of or had collaborated with the secret services before suggesting that she had behaved inappropriately at the time when she had been a prosecutor without providing specific facts had made it impossible for the ij to verify the allegations the article the applicant had put her name to had introduced the idea that judge lds had carried out her professional duties unlawfully between and when she had worked as a prosecutor the distorted presentation of judge ldss professional activity and the suggestion of questionable moral behaviour on her part had resulted in the president of the court of cassations professional reputation being damaged the applicants personal opinions expressed in the article had constituted behaviour calling into question the honour and professional integrity of judge lds under relevant national and international law free speech was subject to exceptions when a persons right to honour reputation and personal image were affected also when exercising it judges had to behave in such a way as to preserve the dignity of their office and the independence and impartiality of the judiciary by expressing publicly her opinions about the professional activity of a judge the applicant had breached the boundaries of the duty of discretion which had implied moderation and restraint in presenting her opinions the ij took the view that in the applicants case there had been evidence suggesting that the disciplinary offence set out in article a of law no had been committed it considered that the boundaries of the right to freedom of expression had been overstepped and that the applicants assessment of the court of cassations presidents professional activity had been conducted in a manner capable of creating a negative image about the way she had behaved as a prosecutor on april the cdj ordered that a disciplinary investigation be initiated against the applicant for the disciplinary offence set out in article a of law no on may the ij produced a note about the outcome of the disciplinary investigation concerning the applicant and proposed that the note be forwarded to the cdj to establish whether disciplinary proceedings had to be instituted against the applicant by relying on some of the arguments of the note of april see paragraphs above the ij took the view that there was evidence in the case that might suggest that the elements of the disciplinary offence set out in article a of law no had been met in the applicants case on may the cdj closed the proceedings against the applicant in so far as they concerned the commission by the applicant of the alleged disciplinary offence set out in article a of law no however the cdj referred the case to the judges section of the csm secția pentru judecători a consiliului superior al magistraturii the sjcsm for it to determine whether the applicant had breached article of the code of conduct for judges the code it held that article a of law no concerned circumstances where a judge or prosecutor had affected his or her own professional honour and dignity or the reputation of the justice system by his or her own actions and conduct this had not been the applicants case her article had been written in a literary manner had referred to aspects of the communist era which had been well known and had reflected the restrictions imposed on the rights of the people during those times which the applicant had been recalling the article had also contained accurate information concerning the fact that judge lds had worked as a prosecutor and as a judge and that starting from she had been appointed president of the court of cassation the applicant had not used violent or foul language capable of disturbing public opinion and her article had not had a significant media impact however the manner in which the applicants article had been written had created a negative image of how judge lds had carried out her duties as a prosecutor during communism by using the expression comrade prosecutor in the title of the article the applicant had implied that the president of the court of cassation had been at fault for having become the president of all judges even though she had been a prosecutor during the communist regime by contrasting the situation of the people who were poor silent and oppressed with that of the prosecutor lds who was characterised untouchable and rising the applicant had practically held lds guilty for the fact that she had had a superior status because of her position as a prosecutor also from the content of the article it could be understood that the case files processed by lds during communism had been used as a means of oppression in order to root out the enemies of the socialist order and for the pursuit of the new man or to convict women for abortion in addition the applicant stated generically in the article that all these comrades implying also the comrade prosecutor mentioned in the title of the article had been usurpers of christ and his law and had sternly guarded the communist prison lastly the article noted ldss appointment as president of the court of cassation and referred to the fourteen years she had worked as a prosecutor during the communist regime when she has accomplished so much as to become the president of all judges herself the cdj took the view that by writing the article in the abovementioned manner the applicant had brought into question her compliance with the relevant legal provisions concerning the professional conduct of legal professionals by relying on amongst other things article of the code article of the convention the caselaw of the european court of human rights the court and on the applicants statements the cdj held that the applicant had overstepped the limits of expression that had to comply with the duty of discretion thus the balance between an individuals right to freedom of expressions and a democratic states legitimate interest in ensuring that a person holding public office had complied with the scope of article of the convention had been broken the cdj held furthermore that by expressing opinions which could make a reasonable observer that is to say a wellintentioned disinterested and informed person doubt a colleagues professional integrity and morality the applicant had overstepped the limits of freedom of expression in relation to that persons right to personal image honour and reputation therefore there had been evidence suggesting that the applicant had breached article of the code because in the article under her name she had implied that lds had not performed her professional duties lawfully between and when she had been working as a prosecutor the cdj lastly held that the malicious and distorted presentation of ldss professional activity and the suggestion that her behaviour had been questionable without any supporting evidence in that regard had caused unfounded suspicions to be raised about ldss professionalism the personal opinions expressed by the applicant in her article had amounted to conduct that had affected the right to personal image honour and reputation of the judge conduct proceedings against the applicant decision by the sjcsm in a decision of october the sjcsm held that the applicants article had breached article of the code which set out one of the limitations imposed on an officer of the courts right to freedom of expression by relying on similar arguments to the ones relied on by the cdj see paragraphs above the sjcsm held further that the applicants article had been written in a manner that had created a negative image of how judge lds had carried out her duties as a prosecutor during communism the sjcsm dismissed the applicants argument that her article had merely been a literary essay and found that she had overstepped the limits of freedom of expression that had to comply with the duty of discretion thus the balance between her individual right to freedom of expression and a democratic states legitimate interest in ensuring that a person holding public office had complied with the scope of article of the convention had been broken the applicants argument that article of the code could not be read without taking into account the definition of good faith set out in article of law no could not be accepted given that that article defined bad faith and serious negligence and concerned exclusively the exercise of professional functions by judges or prosecutors the sjcsm also reiterated the cdjs finding concerning the applicants conduct see paragraphs above in addition the sjcsm held that in its decision of march declaring unconstitutional the recently passed legislation on lustration the constitutional court had noted that in their opinion submitted to the court the council of the romanian prosecutors association had stated that in accordance with the relevant law in force during communist times civilian prosecutors had been competent to investigate only ordinary offences not political offences and that prosecutors had not only not served the regime but had been the only obstacle against abuses committed by repressive bodies in contrast to the abovementioned point the applicant had referred to the case files processed by lds during that time as being used as a means of oppression in order to root out the enemies of the socialist order and for the pursuit of the new man or to convict women of abortion without presenting any concrete evidence she was therefore practically blaming the president of the court of cassation simply because she had worked as a prosecutor during communism thus she had clearly affected the professional and moral integrity of a fellow judge the applicants challenge against the sjcsm decision on december the applicant challenged the decision before the plenary of the csm she argued that article of the code concerned the expression of an opinion but failed to define the concept in the absence of a definition of this concept it could be reasonably argued that it meant expressing a subjective point of view however in order to affect a persons image honour and reputation such a personal opinion had had to clearly and expressly concern concrete acts and facts capable of compromising the professional integrity or the morality of that person her article had not contained any explicit clear statement concerning the morality and professional integrity of judge lds her essay had contained only several rhetorical questions which had not amounted to a categorical opinion also by using the expression comrade prosecutor she had referred to an undeniable fact within the framework of portraying the communist times relying on international and european instruments concerning judges the applicant argued further that those instruments required special diligence in cases concerning the disciplinary investigation of judges including a careful selection and assessment of strictly objective and essential elements so that any exposure of a judge to unacceptable pressure would be avoided the same requirements had to be complied with in cases of a conduct investigation given that pursuant to domestic law an acknowledgement of a breach of the code amounted to a disciplinary sanction which would prevent her career advancement unlike in other european states the romanian code had not been merely a guide on moral issues but a disguised disciplinary code her conduct which had consisted in her publishing a literary article depicting her personal experiences had been examined in a deficient manner by breaching the highly important objectivity criteria set out in the relevant international instruments thus some segments and expressions from the text had been assessed excessively and had been given subjectively a certain meaning which had been preferred by the investigators also the rules and principles concerning a judges duty of discretion had been misunderstood and had been interpreted very rigidly by relying on arguments that had had no connection to the text the fact that the disciplinary proceedings had been diverted into codeofconduct proceedings supported the argument of the pressure imposed of its own motion by an independent body which had not been created to investigate judges the applicant also argued that her essay had concerned the post of president of the court of cassation and had not referred to a colleague because she had not had any interest in lds as a person under the relevant international rules concerning judges a judge had to be more tolerant and open to questions and criticism since he or she was very exposed to the public that was even more so in cases of judges exercising an official state function the person exercising an official state function was a subject of public interest and therefore it was natural that all aspects concerning that persons past and present career be debated publicly by any person lastly the applicant argued that her essay had been part of a series of other essays that she had already published and had not been a single and isolated work decision by the csms plenary by a decision of january the csms plenary dismissed the applicants challenge it held that the applicants status as an officer of the court had not deprived her of her right to freedom of expression however her conduct consisting of the statements she had made in her article published in the press had breached an officer of the courts duty of discretion thus the balance between an individuals right to freedom of expressions and a democratic states legitimate interest in ensuring that a person holding public office had complied with the scope of article of the convention had been broken an officer of the courts duty of discretion implied moderation and restraint in presenting his or her opinions the applicant had been entitled to express her opinion on some aspects concerning the activity of the justice system however the manner of making some of her statements had broken the abovementioned balance especially since there was no evidence suggesting that under the circumstances the expressions used had represented for her the only way of conveying the information she had intended to present by publishing the article by the manner of presenting the events and the expressions used the applicant had affected the moral and professional integrity of a fellow judge her statements had not been value judgments but had in fact conveyed certain specific points and had been a clear and unequivocal personal opinion concerning the moral and professional integrity of the president of the court of cassation her argument that her article had concerned exclusively the post of president of the court of cassation had been illfounded the opinions expressed in the article had concerned the person holding that post since a distinction could not be made between the post and the person holding it moreover presenting the realities of communist times could have been done in a less intense manner which would not have affected a colleagues professional integrity and honour and with a focus on the problems faced by the justice system the plenary also held that the applicants statements had to be examined in the context of the lack of trust in the justice system that had been apparent for a long time and which had seriously affected its authority and the appearance of impartiality clearly a judge should have known better than anyone the risks of statements which could have a significant impact on the reputation of the system in this context using balanced language with an objective presentation of the systems deficiencies was better than making statements breaching professional conduct about a colleague therefore the applicants argument that her essay had not contained a categorical opinion but only literary rhetorical questions could not be accepted the manner in which the applicant had chosen to express her opinion about the realities of the communist regime in suggesting that a fellow magistrate had had questionable conduct and professional evolution had resulted in unjustified doubts being raised about the morals and professional integrity of the president of the court of cassation lastly the csms plenary concluded that the personal opinions expressed by the applicant in her article had amounted to conduct that had affected the right to personal image honour and reputation of judge ldsthe applicants appeal against the decision by the csms plenary the applicant appealed against the csms plenarys decision before the court of cassation and reiterated the arguments of her challenge of december against the sjcsms decision of october see paragraph above judgment of the court of cassation in a final judgment of november the court of cassation dismissed the applicants appeal as illfounded it held that the applicants article had presented in a distorted way the professional activity of the president of the court of cassation suggesting that she had behaved questionably without presenting supporting evidence the expressions used by the applicant such as comrade prosecutor all these comrades usurpers of christ and his law and have sternly guarded the communist prison may have caused a reasonable observer that is to say a wellintentioned disinterested and informed person to doubt the moral and professional integrity of the person targeted by the article and clearly overstepped the boundaries of the applicants duty of discretion according to the relevant international instruments and the courts caselaw the freedom of expression of officers of the court was exercised mainly under the umbrella of the courts caselaw and of the convention both as regards the duties and responsibilities incumbent on those who serve justice and as regards the limitations imposed on their rights which were necessary to guarantee the authority and impartiality of the justice system as a result the applicants argument that by presenting in an exclusively literary manner her personal life experiences she had not tarnished the dignity of the position of judge or the independence and impartiality of the judiciary could not be accepted because the article had contained clear references to the professional activity and the behaviour of the president of the court of cassation and had made references to the communist period when she had worked as a prosecutor the court held furthermore that the applicants argument that the disciplinary proceedings had been diverted into conduct proceedings on the motion of an independent body which had not been created to investigate alleged misconduct by judges could also not be accepted the rules and regulations concerning the organisation and functions of the csm and its bodies provided expressly for a procedure concerning the examination of alleged breaches of the code which was different from the procedure set out for the examination of alleged disciplinary offences also the manner in which the decisions taken during these separate sets of proceedings could be challenged was different therefore the cdjs decision of may see paragraph above had not represented a diversion of the disciplinary proceedings into codeofconduct proceedings other relevant information other csm and administrative proceedings brought by the applicant on december the applicant asked the csm to remove from her professional file the sjcsms decision of october the csms plenarys decision of january the court of cassations judgment of november and any other information concerning the alleged breach of the code by her in addition she asked the csm to annul its decision to introduce the code she argued that the csms plenarys decision to introduce the code and the code itself had been unconstitutional and therefore any information concerning an alleged breach of the code by her in her professional case file had been unconstitutional on january the csms plenary dismissed the applicants requests as illfounded reasoning that there had been no legal grounds for removing the documents indicated by her from her professional file in addition the decision to introduce the code and the code itself had not been unconstitutional on april the applicant brought administrative proceedings against the csm seeking to have the relevant documents and any other information concerning the alleged breach of the code by her removed from her professional file and the csms decision to introduce the code annulled and article of the code struck down in addition she raised an unconstitutionality objection concerning the decision to introduce the code she argued that amongst other things article of the code was unlawful because it was unclear and lacked precision in so far as the person who was protected by this article was concerned in particular it was unclear whether the protection provided by the article in question concerned a colleague who was working for the same court as the officer of the court under investigation or one who was working for any other court in the country a finding that an officer of the court had breached the code could have negative consequences on his or her career in so far as professional evaluations and career advancement were concerned on september the piteşti court of appeal the court of appeal referred the applicants unconstitutionality objection concerning the csm decision to introduce the code to the constitutional court the constitutional court proceedings appear to be still pending in a judgment of october which was amenable to appeal the court of appeal rejected the administrative proceedings brought by the applicant against the csm as illfounded there is no evidence in the file whether this set of proceedings ended in a final judgment information submitted to the court by the parties the applicants participation in competitions for posts at the court of cassation on february the csm asked the ij to produce a report on the professional integrity of the candidates including the applicant who had been declared eligible to participate in a competition organised from january to may for promotions to the court of cassation on april the ij produced the report concerning the applicant it noted that i following press allegations about unlawful rent reimbursement claims made by the applicant the relevant authorities had stopped paying for her rent and she had initiated court proceedings against the authorities ii the sjcsm had decided to impose a disciplinary penalty on the applicant following a conflict she had had with a colleague in but the decision had not been final at the time of the report iii and that according to the final sjcsm decision of october see paragraph above the applicant had breached article of the code subsequently the ij concluded that the applicant had not met the necessary requirements of conduct duties and integrity to compete for a court of cassation post on january and november the csm informed the government that the applicant had met the lawful conditions for participation in the competition see paragraph above but she had failed to attend the actual exams the outcome of the conduct proceedings against her had not prevented her from applying for promotions according to the relevant legal provisions the sjcsms decision of october had been attached to the applicants professional file had to be taken into account during her professional evaluation and would be effective for three years the applicants professional appraisals for and had not been finalised because of objective administrative reasons on june the csm informed the applicant that a judges possible promotion to the court of cassation was assessed in the light of a candidates last three finalised professional appraisals attached to his or her professional file the rating of a judges activity in each of the appraisals had to be very good for him or her to be eligible to participate in the competition an appraisal reports finding concerning a judges integrity was effective only for the threeyear period under assessment and did not have any effect on subsequent reports given the manner in which the ratings were calculated a codeofconduct penalty could not result on its own in the officer of the court not being given a very good rating in his or her appraisal report since the csm had examined seven cases concerning possible breaches of article of the code by judges and prosecutors in two cases including the applicants case the sjcsm had found that article of the code had been breached while in the remaining five cases it had been decided in final decisions that the aforementioned article had not been breached on november the president of the bucharest court of appeal informed the government that the applicant would not be eligible to apply for promotions to the court of cassation until january regardless of the outcome of her appraisals because in the court of cassation had confirmed the disciplinary penalty imposed on the applicant for the events which had taken place in see paragraph above the court of cassations judgment of april in a final judgment of april published in the official gazette no of february the court of cassation allowed the administrative proceedings brought by judge gb who was attached to a county court who had been found to have breached article of the code following a public statement concerning the moral integrity of lds who had been the president of the court of cassation at the time of the statement against the csm seeking to have article of the code struck down and an order that the judgment be published in the official gazette the court held that the article in question was unlawful because it was unclear and had lacked precision in so far as the person who was protected by this article was concerned in particular it was unclear whether the protection provided by the article in question concerned a colleague who was working for the same court as the judge under investigation or who was working for any other court in the country a finding that an officer of the court had breached the code could have had negative consequences on his or her career in so far as the professional evaluations and career advancement were concerned in a final judgment of december the court of cassation allowed the proceedings brought by judge gb seeking to have the final sjcsm decision finding her responsible for breaching article of the code annulled with reference to the final judgment of april see paragraph above information concerning the governments former agent on january the government asked the court for an extension of the initial timelimit set for the submission of their observations on the admissibility and merits of the applicants case in a letter which was signed on ms brumars behalf the court granted the requested extension and the government eventually submitted their observations to the court on april ms brumar was replaced from the post of government agent on february on february following an enquiry submitted by the applicants

54,the first applicant company axel springer se is a publishing house operated in the legal form of a societas europea registered in berlin the second applicant company rtl television gmb h is a broadcasting company set up as a private limited company registered in cologne on june the defendant s then aged was arrested the public prosecutors office charged him with killing his parents dismembering their bodies burning some of the parts flushing others down the toilet and disposing of the rest by putting them in barrels s confessed to the police several german newspapers reported on the case some published pictures of s which mostly showed him at a much younger age the public prosecutors office obtained a psychiatric expert opinion in october the expert concluded that s was suffering from a schizoid personality disorder at the time when he had committed the offence the trial against s began on january at the potsdam regional court photographers working for the applicant companies attended the hearings to take still photographs and make videorecordings of the defendant prior to the start of the hearing the presiding judge informed the photojournalists orally that the defendants face would have to be made unidentifiable in the usual manner before any images of him were published according to the applicant companies the presiding judge had indicated at the beginning of the hearing on january that anyone who failed to comply with this order no longer needed to show himself at the regional court of potsdam and apply for permission to take photos of future proceedings the applicant companies submitted a copy of an email of a journalist who attended the hearing confirming the alleged statement of the presiding judge the government contested the applicant companies assertions that the presiding judge had threatened not only to bar journalists from taking photographs during the proceedings against the defendant but also from future proceedings before the potsdam regional court the government submitted that according to the presiding judge no such statement had been made s repeated his confession on the first day of the hearing by a letter of january the second applicant company asked the president of the regional court to change the presiding judges oral order it pointed out inter alia that several unpixelated pictures of s had been published in different newspapers before by a letter of the same date the president replied that he had forwarded the letter to the presiding judge for lack of competence on january the presiding judge supplemented his order and provided his reasons in writing the only media representatives who were permitted to take photographs and make videorecordings of s were those who had previously registered with the court and given an assurance that prior to the publication or forwarding of the material the face of s would be disguised by a technical process for example by pixelisation so that it would only be possible to use the images in such a form journalists were barred from further reporting on the case if they failed to comply with the order the presiding judge stated in his reasons that he had to balance the public interest in being informed and the personality rights of s he acknowledged that the crime at issue was very different from usual crimes and that permitting only pictures that disguised s impaired the publics ability to be informed however he held that the order was justified in view of the need to protect the personality rights of s he reasoned that it was unlikely that the case had caused a sensation throughout germany no nationwide television channel besides the second applicant had shown any interest in reporting on it he stressed the importance of the presumption of innocence finding that reporting on s in a way which identified him could have a pillory effect consequently according to the presiding judge the personality rights of s who had never been in the public eye or sought to contact the media and who had expressly requested that his identity be concealed outweighed the public interest in being informed furthermore the order had already proved to be necessary as there had been individual violations of the judges instructions following the first day of the hearing on january the presiding judge sent the supplemented written order to a number of journalists including some who worked for the applicant companies on january the applicant companies filed an objection gegenvorstellung requesting the suspension of the judicial order banning the publication of images enabling identification during the proceedings against s für die dauer des prozesses gegen s the applicant companies stressed the fact that s had confessed to the crime on the first day of the hearing on february the presiding judge upheld the order he held that the implications of the confession and its credibility could only be assessed at the end of the hearing further hearings took place on and january and on february on february the regional court delivered its verdict sentencing the defendant to prison on two counts of murder on february the

two their agents ms k behr and mr hj behrens of the federal ministry of justice the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows background and scope of the case upon the reunification of germany the judges and public prosecutors who had worked in the former german democratic republic were given the opportunity to apply to be integrated into the judiciary of the new länder background checks were performed on all candidates including with the federal commissioner responsible for examining the documents of the state security service of the former gdr bundesbeauftragter für die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr the federal commissioner some judges and public prosecutors who had collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security were integrated into the brandenburg judiciary because their collaboration was deemed not to have been so severe that it called into question their suitability for office in total less than half of the nearly three hundred judges and slightly more than half of the approximately two hundred public prosecutors who had worked in brandenburg in november were integrated into the judiciary of the land of brandenburg in reunified germany in and a member of parliament of the land of brandenburg submitted several questions to the brandenburg government concerning the collaboration of certain members of the brandenburg judiciary with the ministry of state security of the former gdr the minister of justice of the land of brandenburg stated that there were thirteen judges and one public prosecutor for whom there were indications that they had collaborated with the ministry of state security nine of those judges were serving in ordinary courts while four were serving in specialised courts the minister stated that the indications as to their collaborative involvement had been known when the decisions to integrate them into the judiciary of the land of brandenburg or their lifetime appointment had been taken the minister of justice subsequently declared that nine of the thirteen judges had performed their military service with the felix dzerzhinsky guards regiment affiliated with the ministry of state security while the four others had been secret informants informelle mitarbeiter as had the public prosecutor the background to the case and its procedural history notably the proceedings for interim measures before the domestic courts by which the applicant sought to obtain certain information on the thirteen judges and the public prosecutor are described in detail in the courts decision on the applicants previous application see saure v germany dec no august that application which had been lodged on december against the decisions taken by the domestic courts in the proceedings for interim measures was considered premature by the court and declared inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remedies because the applicants constitutional complaint concerning the main proceedings was still pending before the federal constitutional court ibid the present application was lodged in respect of the main proceedings following the rejection of that constitutional complaint proceedings at issue on august the applicant lodged an application for disclosure of the following information against the land of brandenburg with the potsdam administrative court which corresponded verbatim to the request he had made and continued to pursue in the then ongoing proceedings for interim measures see saure cited above no i what incriminating findings are available against the thirteen judges and the public prosecutor who are still serving at presentii what are the names of the thirteen judges where are they currently servingiii what is the name of the public prosecutor where is he currently servingiv which of the thirteen judges are currently dealing with or have dealt with in the last twentyone years proceedings concerning wrongful acts committed by the gdr verfahren zur aufarbeitung von ddrunrecht andor with restitution proceedings under the property act restitutionsverfahren nach dem vermögensgesetz andor gdr rehabilitation proceedings ddr rehabilitierungsverfahren by a decision of october the berlin brandenburg administrative court of appeal in the proceedings for interim measures brought by the applicant see saure cited above no ordered that the following information be disclosedi how many of the nine judges serving in ordinary courts are currently serving in civil or criminal courts and at what level of jurisdictionii in which specialised courts are the other four judges serving and at what level of jurisdictioniii how many of the thirteen judges concerned have over the past twentyone years dealt with proceedings concerning restitution of property under the property act or proceedings governed by the criminal rehabilitation act strafrechtliches rehabilitierungsgesetz it dismissed the remainder of the applicants appeal on december the brandenburg ministry of justice disclosed the following information of the nine judges serving in ordinary courts four were serving at a district court four served in a regional court and one served in a court of appeal four judges dealt with civil cases four dealt with criminal cases and one dealt with both civil and criminal matters the four judges serving in specialised courts dealt with administrative law labour law and social law and were all serving at courts of first instance subsequently this disclosure was supplemented by a statement that of these four judges two were serving at administrative courts one sat in a labour court and one sat in a social court six of the thirteen judges had previously been involved in restitution proceedings under the property act or proceedings governed by the criminal rehabilitation act in the main proceedings before the potsdam administrative court leading to the present application both parties subsequently declared part of the matter resolved notably in respect of part of the applicants fourth question resulting in the discontinuation of the proceedings in this regard the applicants request for disclosure as presented to the administrative court at the time of its judgment of december read as followsi what incriminating findings are available against the thirteen judges and the public prosecutor who are still serving at presentii what are the names of the thirteen judges where are they currently servingiii what is the name of the public prosecutor where is he currently servingiv which of the thirteen judges concerned are currently dealing with or have previously dealt with proceedings concerning wrongful acts committed by the gdr verfahren zur aufarbeitung von ddrunrecht the administrative court dismissed the application for disclosure it reproduced the reasoning of the administrative court of appeals decision of october in its entirety in so far as that court had dismissed the applicants appeal see paragraph above endorsed it and added some considerations as to the balancing exercise it had performed itself as to the first question of the applicants information request the administrative court considered that he was not entitled to disclosure of the information sought that is to say incriminating findings in respect of the thirteen judges and one public prosecutor who were currently serving in the brandenburg judiciary and for whom there were indications that they had previously collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security firstly while the prerequisites for a request under section of the brandenburg press act see paragraph below were met he could not base a request on that provision because the provisions of the stasi records act gesetz über die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen deutschen demokratischen republik were lex specialis where the disclosure sought concerned records of the state security service of the former gdr first sentence of section and first sentence of section of the stasi records act see paragraph below this conclusion was confirmed by section of the stasi records act according to which personal information transmitted by the federal commissioner could as a rule only be used for the purposes for which it had been transmitted see paragraph below in the present case this purpose was assessing whether the individuals concerned could be integrated into the brandenburg judiciary there was no exemption from that rule that would allow disclosure of such information to the press secondly the applicant could not rely on sections and of the stasi records act see paragraph below irrespective of whether the requirements of those provisions were met as such a request would be directed against the federal commissioner rather than the land of brandenburg thirdly the applicant had failed to prove that he was entitled to disclosure of the information under the brandenburg information act brandenburgisches akteneinsichts und informationsgesetz see paragraph below or article of the constitution of the land of brandenburg see paragraph below in any event the provisions of the stasi records act were also lex specialis in relation to claims under these provisions and prevented disclosure fourthly the applicant could not rely on the first sentence of article of the basic law see paragraph below as the right to freedom of information informationsfreiheit only gave a right to obtain information from sources that were intended to be generally accessible that was not the case with regard to the information sought by the applicant in so far as the applicant submitted that the law had changed and files held by the authorities were generally accessible following the entry into force of the federal freedom of information act informationsfreiheitsgesetz des bundes the court noted that the scope of the right to freedom of information under the basic law remained unaffected by this development a request based on the federal freedom of information act was in any event ruled out as the provisions of the stasi records act were lex specialis lastly the applicant was not entitled to disclosure of the requested information based on the freedom of the press guaranteed by the second sentence of article of the basic law which he had not even invoked since the scope of that right did not extend to the opening up of a source of information which was not generally accessible eröffnung einer informationsquelle as to the first part of the applicants second and third question regarding the names of the judges and public prosecutor the administrative court found that he was not entitled to disclosure of the requested information either the prerequisites for a request under section of the brandenburg press act were met but the respondent was entitled to refuse disclosure of the information in accordance with section of that act see paragraph below disclosure of the names would affect the right to protection of personality rights allgemeines persönlichkeitsrecht of the individuals concerned and their interests outweighed the interests of the applicant as a journalist and the public in disclosure of the names of the judges and public prosecutor for whom there were indications that they had previously collaborated with the ministry of state security of the former gdr despite the significance of the requested disclosure for the work of the press in a democratic society reiterating that there was no general rule that priority be accorded in the event of a conflict between the aforementioned constitutional rights the administrative court considered as regards the interests of the applicant as a journalist and the public in disclosure of the impugned information that a free and independent press was of particular significance in a democratic society to effectively exercise that role the press had to have in principle unlimited access to information including by obtaining access to sources of information that were not generally accessible in order to inform others the media first had to be informed themselves to that end they needed to have access to the internal workings of administrations and the processes taking place there it was in general for the press to evaluate and decide what it regarded as being information of public interest making use of the requested information was the editorial responsibility of the respective media outlet alone in which context the press could in general be trusted to be aware of its responsibility and to comply with the principles of the press code of conduct and the guidelines issued in that regard the mere possibility that a publication would violate personality rights was not sufficient for refusing the disclosure of information to the press it was evident that there was a public interest in disclosure of the names of the judges and public prosecutor for whom there were indications that they had previously collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security on the other hand the administrative court considered that disclosure would interfere with the right of the judges and public prosecutor to informational selfdetermination that is to say their authority to themselves decide when and within which boundaries facts and circumstances of their personal lives were to enter the public domain and would have severe consequences they would be stigmatised their work would be closely watched by the public and there was a risk that their current and past decisions would be subject to public criticism solely because they had previously collaborated with the ministry of state security of the former gdr their reputation could be harmed and they could possibly face hostile behaviour both in their professional and personal life as the matter concerned only fourteen people and the applicant worked as a journalist for a newspaper with a large circulation the potential publication of the individuals names could be expected to have a considerable impact moreover even though the individuals concerned held particularly important positions they had never sought public attention and had kept a low profile since being integrated into the brandenburg judiciary after the reunification of germany the information request did not concern professional conduct in relation to their current functions furthermore the potential collaboration with the ministry of state security of the former gdr which the persons concerned had not concealed when their applications had been assessed had occurred more than twenty years earlier and they had undergone background checks by the committees for the selection of judges and public prosecutors these committees had examined applications on a casebycase basis assessing the nature and scope of the collaboration with the ministry of state security the severity of the harm that could have been caused the reasons for the commencement and discontinuation of the collaboration the age of the person concerned as well as the intended function within the judiciary in accordance with the relevant guidelines persons whose collaboration with the gdr ministry of state security had exceeded the official duties imposed on them had not been appointed to the brandenburg judiciary whether or not it was reasonable that an individual be part of public service had been determined based on his or her function within the gdr ministry of state security and his or her conduct after the end of the collaboration in the select cases in which judges and public prosecutors had been integrated into the brandenburg judiciary despite indications or evidence of their prior collaboration with the gdr ministry of state security such collaboration had been determined as not to have been so severe that it opposed their integration into the brandenburg judiciary that decision taken by the land of brandenburg more than twenty years earlier placed the land as the employer under an obligation not to disclose their identity at least if there was no professional misconduct as to the second part of his second and third question regarding where the judges and public prosecutor were serving the administrative court found that the applicant was not entitled to disclosure of more information than what he had already received it essentially relied on the consideration that depending on where the individuals concerned served it was likely that they would be identified even if the information were disclosed in an anonymised form given the small number of judges and public prosecutors working in certain places this would notably be the case if the public prosecutor were employed at the brandenburg prosecutor generals office in view of the information released so far and the wording of the applicants information request the public prosecutor was male and there were only eight male public prosecutors at that office who could be concerned against this background the applicant was not entitled to know whether the individual concerned worked at the prosecutor generals office or at one of the four public prosecutors offices in brandenburg for similar considerations it was not possible to disclose where the judges concerned were currently serving while ensuring their anonymity if they served at one of the courts with a small number of judges it was likely that they would be identified also bearing in mind additional aspects which could lead to their identification such as their age or whether they had been citizens of the gdr as regards the applicants fourth question as presented to the administrative court at the time of its judgment that is limited to the question of which of the thirteen judges concerned had previously dealt with or were currently dealing with proceedings concerning wrongful acts committed by the gdr see paragraph above the administrative court endorsed the reasoning of the administrative court of appeal in its decision of october see paragraph above which had found that this request was too vague as it was not possible to determine on which types of proceedings the applicant sought to obtain information the administrative court added that the applicant was not entitled to receive the requested information under article of the convention either lastly there were no indications that his procedural rights including the right to a fair trial had been infringed by the fact that the judges concerned were serving in the brandenburg judiciary contrary to his allegation to that effect on january the applicant lodged a request for leave to appeal by an order of september the berlin brandenburg administrative court of appeal dismissed the applicants request for leave to appeal it rejected his submissions expressing doubts as to the correctness of the administrative courts judgment which related to the alleged wrongful application of domestic law the court of appeals decision was served on the applicants counsel on september in his constitutional complaint of october the applicant alleged a violation of his rights under the first and second sentence of article of the basic law his right to be heard and article of the convention by an order of december the federal constitutional court declined to accept the applicants constitutional complaint for adjudication no bv r without providing reasons the decision was served on the applicants counsel on december events outside the scope of the proceedings at issue on an undisclosed date the applicant turned to the federal commissioner he requested access to the records held and to be allowed to consult its files documenting the processing of the requests by the brandenburg ministry of justice no further information on the outcome of these requests was provided by the parties following another query by the applicant the authorities of the land of brandenburg provided him with the following information in july since december one judge had dealt with proceedings concerning restitution under the property act or proceedings governed by the criminal rehabilitation act three of the thirteen judges concerned had in the meantime retired relevant legal framework and practice article of the basic law reads in so far as relevant as follows article every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech writing and pictures and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources freedom of the press and freedom of reporting by means of broadcasts and films shall be guaranteed there shall be no censorship these rights shall find their limits in the

follows every person shall have the right under law to inspect files and other official documents maintained by the authorities and administrative institutions of the land and the municipalities provided that there are no overriding public or private interests to the contrary the relevant provisions of the brandenburg information act akteneinsichts und informationszugangsgesetz des landes

interests under sections and or other legal provisions contain sectorspecific regulations applicable to an unlimited group of persons section the obligation to comply with statutory confidentiality obligations to maintain professional secrecy or to protect special official secrets that are not based on statutory regulations shall remain unaffected section subject to the second sentence and subsections and an application to consult records shall be refused if this involves the disclosure of personal data unless the party directly affected has consented to the disclosure of the data or the disclosure is permitted by another legal provision the right to consult records may be granted in so far as on account of the particular circumstances of an individual case and in the light of the purpose of assuring participation in political processes the interest of the person filing the request in obtaining disclosure outweighs the interest of the person affected in having this information kept confidential section shall apply mutatis mutandis section of the brandenburg press act brandenburgisches pressegesetz provides in so far as relevant as follows the authorities are under an obligation to disclose to representatives of the press information which serves the fulfilment of their public duties disclosure of information may be refused if and in so far as the proper conduct of pending proceedings may be frustrated or jeopardised regulations concerning the secrecy of such information preclude it an overriding public interest or private interests meriting protection would be violated or the scope of the information being sought exceeds what can reasonably be expected the provisions of the stasi records act gesetz über die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen deutschen demokratischen republik read in so far as relevant as follows section the federal commissioner shall register store manage and use the records of the state security service in accordance with this act section governmental and nongovernmental bodies shall have access to the records and may only use them in accordance with this act if persons concerned third parties close relatives of missing or deceased persons employees or beneficiaries of the state security service voluntarily and of their own accord make records available that provide information regarding themselves these records may also be used for the purposes for which they have been made available section personal information transmitted in accordance with sections to and may only be processed and used for the purposes for which it has been transmitted it may only be used for other purposes if the requirements pursuant to sections to and are met the consent of the federal commissioner shall be required if pursuant to the second sentence of subsection personal information regarding persons concerned or third parties is to be processed or used for another purpose subsections and shall apply mutatis mutandis to personal information in the records which pursuant to section shall remain with public bodies section the provisions of this act shall take precedence over provisions concerning the permissibility of transmitting personal data set out in other acts sections to and of the act do not concern information requests by the press sections to of the act concern use of the records for political and historical analysis as well as in the press broadcast media and film and specify the circumstances under which the federal commissioner may make certain records available for these purposes according to the government in administrative practice the stasi records act does not in general rule out the disclosure of personal information by the bodies which have requested such information where this concerns for example a summary of the contents of the records this type of disclosure may under certain circumstances still be covered by the original purpose pursued by the transmission of the records in practice the body requesting such information for example a municipal representative body informs the public of the results achieved by the background checks for its institution and also states in a summary manner its assessment of the records the question of whether or not such a statement of position is permissible primarily concerns the legal relationship between the requesting body and the persons regarding whom a background check was performed with employers having a duty of care towards their employees under section of the courts constitution act

56,in may the applicants wrote a letter to the international supervisor for bd to the president of the assembly of bd and to the governor of bd concerning the appointment of a director of the bd public radio station they referred in particular to msʼs candidacy for that position ms was the entertainment editor at the bd public radio at the material time the relevant part of the letter reads as follows we acknowledge and appreciate your support and the effort you put in creating a multiethnic radio unfortunately it appears that there was a major oversight at the very beginning of this important venture the panel for the selection of the director of the radio was created in contravention of the statute of brčko district it is composed of three serb members one croat and one bosniac thus yet again the statute which requires proportional representation of the three constituent peoples in public institutions was disregarded unfortunately nothing has been done to correct this the unofficial information we received to the effect that ms ms was proposed for the position of the radio director by the serb members of the panel although the former director was bosniac confirms the above this proposal is unacceptable all the more so because it concerns a person who lacks the professional and moral qualities for such a position according to the information we receivedin an interview published in nin discussing the destruction of mosques in brčko ms ms said that muslims were not people that they did not possess culture and that accordingly destroying mosques could not be seen as a destruction of cultural monuments on the radios premises she made a point of removing from the wall and tore to pieces the calendar with the schedule of religious services during the month of ramadanon the radios premises she covered the coat of arms of bosnia and herzegovina with the coat of arms of the republika srpskaas the editor of the entertainment programme she banned broadcasting of sevdalinka arguing that that type of song had no cultural or musical value we firmly believe that the abovedescribed acts absolutely disqualify ms ms as a candidate for the position of the director of the multiethnic radio and television of brčko district we hope that you will act accordingly in the absence of any action on your part we will be forced to contact the media as well as the other competent national and international bodies shortly thereafter the letter was published in three different daily newspapers on may ms initiated civil defamation proceedings against the applicants and claimed compensation of convertible marks bam ms submitted that she had learned about the content of the letter shorlty after it had been sent by the defendants but that she did not know who gave it to the media after the letter was published the governor of bd annulled the proceedings for the appointment of a director of the public radio station on september the bd court of first instance the court of first instance rejected the claim it held that the applicants could not be liable for the alleged defamation because they had not published the letter in the media the relevant part of the judgment reads as follows from the defendants letter it is clear that it was privately sent to the governor to the president of the assembly and to the supervisor for brčko districtand it was not sent to the media the aim of the letter was not dissemination of unverified information to public but bringing the attention of the competent authorities to certain issues and to enable them to draw certain conclusions on verification of that information having examined the articles published in the media the court concludes that none of them was published by the defendants in this case ms appealed against that judgment to the bd appellate court the appellate court on may the appellate court quashed the judgment of september and decided to hold a new hearing on july after having examined several witnesses including the two employees of the bd public radio from whom the applicants received the information presented in their letter the appellate court found that the contested letter contained some valuejudgments but also the statements of facts which had been untrue and damaging to msʼs reputation it held that for the liability for defamation to be established under section of the defamation act it was irrelevant that the applicants did not publish the letter the appellate court ordered the applicants to inform the international supervisor for bd the president of the assembly of bd and the bds governor about the retraction of their statements within days in default of which they had to pay bam in damage to ms together with default interest at the statutory rate from july they were further ordered to publish the judgment at their own expense on november ms filed a request for the enforcement of the above judgment to the court of first instance she proposed inter alia that the court send the judgment of july for publication at the applicants expense on december the court of first instance issued a writ of execution on december the applicants paid bam approximately euros eur by way of the enforcement of the judgment of july on march the court of first instance closed the enforcement proceedings in the meantime on october the applicants complained about the violation of their right to freedom of expression to the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina the constitutional court on may the constitutional court held that the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression was necessary in a democratic society and concluded that there had been no violation of article iih of the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina and article of the convention the relevant part of the decision reads as follows at the outset the constitutional court notes that the appellants did not deny that their liability for defamation was based on the defamation act and that therefore the interference with the right to freedom of expression protected by article of the european convention was prescribed by law the impugned judgment was delievered in a civil defamation proceedings initiated by the plaintiff against the appellantsaccordingly the interference pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation or rights of others what remains to be determined is whether the interference complained of was necessary in a democratic society the constitutional court considers that the appellate court established without doubt that the impugned factual statements about ms were false and that the appellants were liable for defamation from the submissions of the two witnesses from whom the appellants received the information presented in the letter concerning the part of the letter in which it was stated that ms made a point of removing from the wall and tore to pieces the calendar with the schedule of religious services during the month of ramadan and as the editor of the entertainment programme she banned broadcasting of sevdalinka arguing that that type of song had no cultural or musical value the appellate court established that there was an evident inconsistency between that what had been said to the appellants and that what they had reported in the letter furthermore the statement from the impugned letter that ms gave an interview concerning the destruction of mosques was refuted by another witness who submitted that a subsequent verification had revealed that ms had not been the author of the said interview finally the appellants failed to prove the veracity of the allegations that ms covered the coat of arms of bosnia and herzegovina with the coat of arms of the republika srpska in view of the above the constitutional court considers that in the present case the right of the appellants to report irregularities in the conduct of an official to a body competent to deal with such complaints can not be premised on ascertaining manifestly untrue facts which go beyond the limit of acceptable criticism of civil servants accordingly the court considers that the appellate court correctly concluded that there was a pressing social need in the present case for the interference with the appellants right to freedom of expression furthermore the constitutional court notes that the appellate court awarded nonpecuniary damage to ms because her reputation was affected by the untrue statements made in the impugned letter the constitutional court has already stated in its previous jurisprudence that a persons reputation forms part of her personal identity and psychological integrity the appellantsfailed to verify the impugned statements beforehand as was their duty the appeal court established that the appellants had damaged mss reputation by making untrue allegations which caused her mental anguish when deciding on the claim in respect of nonpecuniary damage and its amount the appellate court took into account the purpose of those damages as well as that it should not favour aspirations that are incompatible with its nature and social purpose the constitutional court considers that a measure imposed on the appellants in the present case was proportionate to the aim pursued the court further considers that the appellate court did not go beyond its discretionary power in deciding on the claim in respect of nonpecuniary damage the constitutional court finds that the reasons the appellate court gave were relevant and sufficient within the meaning of article of the european convention in view of the above the constitutional court considers that the interference with the appellants right to freedom of expression was necessary in a democratic society and that therefore there has been no violation of article iih of the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina and article of the european convention on september the constitutional courts decision was served on the applicants ii relevant domestic lawa constitution of bosnia and herzegovina the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina annex to the general framework

57,its seat in vienna and was represented by zöchbauer frauenberger rechtsanwälte a law firm practising in vienna the government were represented by their agent mr h tichy ambassador head of the international law department at the federal ministry for european and international affairs the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows the applicant company is the media owner of the daily newspaper österreich on july österreich reported on a meeting that took place in july between nh then a candidate for the office of federal president of austria and the german daily newspaper bild the article stated that during that meeting nh had been confronted with a photograph from showing nhs office manager büroleiter rs together with the latters brother hs and gk at an event identified as being part of the rightwing scene see paragraph below statements made by nh in reaction to the political past of his office manager were reported the article in question appeared at a delicate point during the presidential elections in austria on july the constitutional court had declared unconstitutional a runoff ballot between nh the candidate of the freedom party of austria freiheitliche partei österreich or fpö and avd b an independent candidate supported by the greens die grünen because of inconsistencies in the counting of the votes see constitutional court judgment no wi of july the difference in ballots cast for the two candidates amounted to only around votes a second repeated runoff ballot was planned for october public interest in the two candidates and the election process was immense at the time the report printed in österreich which was illustrated by inter alia the abovementioned photograph read as follows interview with bild fuss about nh in germany fp freedom party candidates office manager appears in a photo with neo nazi gknewspaper bild caused an unpleasant situation for fpö candidate nhberlin nh the candidate for federal president designated by the freedom party had intended to launch a charm offensive by means of giving several international interviews the german newspaper bild thwarted his plans though nhs staff member was present at the interview because after the talk the bild journalists showed a photograph to nh depicting convicted neo nazis gk and hs and the latters brother rs hs and rs carry batons schlagstöcke gk gives the radical rightwing kühnen salute the nazi salute with extended thumb index and middle finger the matter is piquant pikant because today rs works as the office manager of nh in this capacity he was also present at the bild interview but initially the editors did not notice that at all rs was under and does not have a criminal record nh defends himself yes this is rs i know the photo my staff member never did anything wrong he has never been indicted or convicted one should not rs how long ago did that take place years ago use something like that against someone bild quoted h as saying specifically the photograph is of a meeting in rs was not yet eighteen years old he does not have a criminal record was never convicted or reported to the police says a spokesperson of nh rather rs was perceived as a follower mitläufer of the rightwing scene of that time nh stands by his staff member he does not only retain him as his office manager if he is elected federal president he also wants to take rs with him to the hofburg the official residence and workplace of the federal president of austria on july hs brought proceedings under section of the copyright act see paragraph below requesting that the applicant company be prohibited from publishing pictures of him without his consent in the event that any accompanying text stated that he was a convicted neo nazi andor made statements of equivalent meaning in addition he lodged an application for the issuance of an interim injunction einstweilige verfügung to that effect arguing that his conviction of twenty years earlier had long been expunged he referred to section of the criminal record deletion act tilgungsgesetz see paragraph below according to which all negative consequences that were connected to that conviction ceased to exist he did not dispute that he had been convicted in under the national socialist prohibition act verbotsgesetz the prohibition act but he had been released on parole in he argued that he had reintegrated in society had founded a family and had taken a regular job he stated that by spending several years in prison he had paid for his actions which he had committed during a longclosed phase of his life he had behaved well ever since was no longer a public figure and was certainly not a person of interest within the context of the report he did not even know nh overall he did not have to accept the statement that he was a convicted neo nazi in its submissions in reply klagebeantwortung the applicant company argued that the criminal proceedings against hs had been subject to countless reports by domestic as well as international media in the s the impugned statement that he was a convicted neo nazi was undisputedly true it furthermore submitted that the plaintiff was one of the most important former austrian neo nazis and that the circumstances that had led to his conviction were of historical importance zeitgeschichtlich bedeutend thus the plaintiff was an absolute person of contemporary history absolute person der zeitgeschichte furthermore he had not ceased his respective political activities after his release from prison but was still active in the neo nazi scene by way of proving that statement the applicant company quoted a wikipedia entry about hs as well as an article by the documentation archive of the austrian resistance dokumentationsarchiv des oesterreichischen widerstandes according to which the plaintiff hs had attended two public events with gk in namely an event in carinthia organised by the freedom party of austria and an event in leipzig organized by die freien kräfte leipzig where both hs and gk had allegedly given speeches on the prohibition act there was a public interest in knowing about the political circles in which nh a presidential candidate moved and the impugned report had broached the issue of how the freedom party of austria dealt with rightwing extremism it was therefore covered by article of the convention hs disputed the allegation that he had engaged in any activities in the neo nazi scene after his conviction he argued that the event in carinthia in had served the purpose of commemorating war veterans and had been attended by several members of different political parties as regards the event in leipzig in the same year he denied that he had made the comments that had been mentioned in the articles quoted by the applicant company he had only expressed his personal experiences at an event organised by the national democratic party of germany nationaldemokratische partei deutschland or npd a recognised political party by a decision of august the vienna commercial court handelsgericht wien in provisional proceedings provisorialverfahren dismissed hss application for the issuance of an interim injunction the court essentially argued that the public interest in receiving information on nhs circles including his staff members and the interest of the applicant company in publication outweighed the interest of hs in the observance of confidentiality moreover the assertion made in the article in respect of hs namely that he was a convicted neo nazi was true by a decision of september the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht wien dismissed an appeal lodged by hs essentially endorsing the reasoning of the lower court however following a further appeal by hs the supreme court oberster gerichtshof in a decision of january case no ob g prohibited the applicant company from publishing pictures of hs without his consent if at the same time he is called a convicted neo nazi in the accompanying report andor statements of equivalent meaning are made about him there and gave the following reasoning the supreme court has already approved in case no ob s see paragraph below in respect of another company which is also a part of the defendants media company the prohibition of the publication of the plaintiffs hss image without his consent if the accompanying text describes him as a neo nazi leader and does not state at the same time that he has already served his prison sentence and has behaved well since in the case at hand the defendant published an article in its periodical publication österreich on july in which the claimant hs is referred to as a convicted neo nazi a photograph accompanying this article shows the claimant next to the convicted gk among other persons this court can not uphold the lowerinstance judgments holding that decision no ob s had been complied with despite the fact that the plaintiff was described in the article as a convicted neo nazi but at the same time in the accompanying text it was stated that the neo nazi meeting depicted in the picture had taken place in the supreme court has clarified that any balancing of interests performed when assessing the legality of photojournalistic coverage concerning a convicted person after his or her release on parole must consider among other things the connection between the contents of the report in question and the accompanying picture as well as the completeness and correctness of the accompanying text decision no ob t the contents of the article impugned in this case however are not concerned with the claimant but with his brother and with a candidate for the election of the federal president therefore there was no objective justification at all for the reference to the previous conviction of the claimant as a neo nazi subsequently in the main proceedings the vienna commercial court by judgment of april ordered the applicant company to refrain from now on from publishing pictures of hs without his consent if at the same time he is called a convicted neo nazi in the accompanying report andor statements of equivalent meaning are made about him therein at the same time it dismissed the claim lodged by hs for euros eur plus interest and costs by way of compensation for nonpecuniary damage and ordered the applicant company to reimburse hs for the costs of the proceedings in its reasoning the court essentially noted referring to the reasoning of the supreme court in the provisional proceedings see paragraph above that a balancing of the clearly infringed interests of the claimant against the public interest in the publication that gave rise to the instant proceedings apparently does not have to be carried out the claim lodged by hs for compensation for nonpecuniary damage had to be dismissed given the fact that a particular injury that is to say an injury exceeding the usual measure über das übliche maß hinausgehende kränkung could not have occurred for the very reason that the facts in question are indisputably true the vienna court of appeal did not grant the related appeal lodged by the applicant company dismissing it by a judgment of september it essentially stated that according to the legal view held by the supreme court there had been no objective justification for the reference to the conviction of the claimant as a neo nazi in the impugned article because the contents of the article had not concerned the claimant but his brother and a candidate in the election for the federal president therefore it was unnecessary to balance the individual interests of the claimant against the public interest in being informed about the political environment in which the office manager of the presidential candidate moved it ordered the applicant company to reimburse hs for the costs of the proceedings by a decision of december case no ob s the supreme court rejected an extraordinary appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant company it referred to its reasoning in the provisional proceedings see paragraph above and added citing the case of österreichischer rundfunk v austria no december that there was no temporal connection between the photograph taken in hss criminal conviction in and the applicant company calling him a convicted neo nazi in the impugned article of relevant domestic legal framework and practice section of the copyright act urheberrechtsgesetz prohibits any public exhibition andor dissemination of images where the legitimate interests of the person in question would be violated it reads as follows in its relevant parts protection of ones image section images of persons shall neither be exhibited publicly nor disseminated in any other manner by which they are made accessible to the public where the legitimate interests of the person in question or in the event that they have died without having authorised or ordered publication of a close relative would be injured in assessing whether legitimate interests are violated not only the picture alone has to be considered but also the accompanying text in its overall context see supreme court cases no ob t and no ob w in its decision of october case no ob s see paragraph above regarding a different article published by the applicant company that had contained a photograph of hs with the accompanying caption neo nazi leader the supreme court held that the picture as such was connected with events of contemporary historical significance however the publication of photographs that together with the accompanying text recalled crimes committed long ago by the person depicted would generally disproportionately impair his or her advancement owing to the pillorying effect prangerwirkung that would arise therefrom according to the supreme court this applied all the more if the person concerned in the instant case hs in had already served his or her prison sentence and had been socially reintegrated for years and for those reasons had a legitimate interest in the public not being reminded of his or her past the supreme court found that the lower courts had taken into account the public interest in the publication of the photograph as they had not generally prohibited it a legitimate interest in such publication could not however justify creating the incorrect impression that hs who had been fully rehabilitated and was not any longer in the public eye was still active as a neo nazi leader starting with its judgment of september case no ob the supreme court has consistently held that section of the copyright act has to be interpreted in the light of section a of the media act mediengesetz this provision specifies in which cases the publication of images of victims suspects or offenders is to be permitted by giving details of the criteria for the balancing of interests to be performed accordingly the austrian courts have to assess by way of a first step whether there is a public interest in publication and which legitimate interests of the person concerned run counter to publication subsequently the legitimate interests of the person concerned must be balanced against the public interest if any in the publication of that persons image publication is permitted only if the public interest in publication is the overriding interest such overriding public interest in publication may exist for instance on account of the persons position in society or of some other connection of that person with public life section a of the media act provides that the legitimate interests of the person concerned will in any event be harmed if the publication of an article or photograph may disproportionately prejudice the advancement of the person concerned sections to of the criminal record deletion act tilgungsgesetz read as follows in their relevant parts expunging of criminal convictions section save for cases where it is excluded judicial convictions will be expunged getilgt ex lege at the expiry of the applicable period with the expunging of a conviction all negative consequences that are connected by law to that conviction cease to exist unless they consist of the loss of special rights on the basis of election award or appointment if a conviction has been expunged from the criminal record the convicted person will henceforth be deemed to be judicially innocent unbescholten unless this is countered by another as yet unexpunged conviction heshe is not obliged to mention the expunged

58,the applicant is a registered association which has its seat in vienna its aim is to research and study past and present transfers of ownership of agricultural and forest land in order to reach conclusions as to the impact of such transfers on society the applicant association also gives opinions on draft laws falling within its field of interest in essence agricultural and forest land transactions require approval by local and regional authorities the latter are called regional real property transactions commissions landes grundverkehrskommissionen the aim of this requirement laid down in the real property transactions acts of the länder is to preserve land for agricultural use and forestry and in some of the regions including tyrol to avoid the proliferation of second homes the applicant association states that it is sent all decisions issued by the regional real property transactions commissions with the exception of the one for tyrol in the decisions it receives the names of parties and other sensitive data are usually anonymised on april the association asked the tyrol real property transactions commission the commission to provide by mail all decisions issued since january in anonymised form the costs thereof to be reimbursed by letter of july the commission replied that it could not comply with the request owing to lack of time and personnel on july the applicant association submitted a further request this time requesting the provision by mail of all decisions issued since january in anonymised form in the event of refusal of the application it demanded a formal decision in accordance with the tyrol access to information act tiroler auskunftspflichtgesetz the information act the applicant association argued that since the commissions decisions concerned civil rights within the meaning of article of the convention the decisions should be either publicly announced or made public by other appropriate means in its decision of october the commission rejected the request holding that the transmission of anonymised copies of its decisions did not constitute information within the meaning of section of the information act which defines information as existing knowledge on matters known to the authority at the time it provides the information moreover even if the request were to fall within the scope of that provision the information act stated that pursuant to section subparagraph c there was no duty to provide the information if doing so would require so many resources that the functioning of the authority would be affected the decision stated that complaints could be lodged with the constitutional court verfassungsgerichtshof and the administrative court verwaltungsgerichtshof the applicant association complained to both the constitutional court and the administrative court it relied on article of the convention in its submissions in reply to the applicant associations complaint to the constitutional court and the administrative court the commission maintained that its decisions did not constitute information within the meaning of the information act it argued that a decision contained the facts of the case and the legal conclusions the authority had drawn from them legal arguments could be discussed and decisions could be challenged and set aside if the legal conclusions were found to be wrong therefore giving someone access to a decision was comparable to giving someone legal advice as opposed to providing information as defined in the information act on september the administrative court declared that it did not have jurisdiction to deal with the case and rejected the applicant associations complaint the administrative court held that it was only competent to deal with complaints against decisions regarding transfers of building plots and not with complaints brought against the commissions decisions on transfers of agricultural or forest land as the applicant association had not claimed to have been party to the transfer of a building plot it could not base its complaint on that status neither did the information act contain any rule stating that complaints about decisions by the commission pursuant to the information act were to be lodged with the administrative court therefore the matter was excluded from the administrative courts jurisdiction consequently the statement in the commissions decision that a complaint could be lodged with the administrative court was not correct on february the constitutional court declined to deal with the case for lack of prospects of success from the perspective of constitutional law and also because the matter was not excluded from the administrative courts jurisdiction the decision was served on the associations representative on april after the government had been notified of the present application the applicant association relying on the governments argument in respect of exhaustion of domestic remedies see paragraph below lodged an application under article of the federal constitution seeking a ruling from the constitutional court on the negative conflict of jurisdiction between it and the administrative court on december the constitutional court issued a decision stating that it was competent to rule on the applicant associations complaint against the commissions decision of october consequently it set aside its own decision of february and awarded the applicant association reimbursement of the costs of the proceedings in a further decision of december the constitutional court ruled on the merits of the applicant associations complaint referring to the courts caselaw and its own caselaw it held in particular that whilst the right to receive information enshrined in article of the convention prohibited states from restricting the receipt of information that others wished to or might be willing to impart it did not by contrast impose a positive obligation on states to collect and disseminate information of their own motion the constitutional court added that in accordance with its established caselaw article did not require the state to grant access to information or to make information available of its own motion consequently the commissions refusal to transmit anonymised copies of all decisions issued during a specific period of time to the applicant association did not constitute an interference with the latters right under article of the convention as to the applicant associations argument that the commissions decision was arbitrary as it had failed to provide reasons the constitutional court referred to the explanatory report on the information act and endorsed the commissions view that the applicant associations request was not merely a question of obtaining information about one or more specific issues but would require the commission to compile of its own motion all decisions issued over a period of some years to anonymise them and to send paper copies thereof to the applicant association the commission had therefore rightly taken the view that the applicant associations request did not fall within the scope of section of the information act moreover the commission had also dealt with the merits of the request in that it had concluded that the provision of information could be refused pursuant to section subparagraph c of the information act as it would require investigations calculations or preparations considerably impinging on the fulfilment of its other tasks lastly the constitutional court observed that the applicant association could be implicitly relying also on article of the convention it noted that neither the courts caselaw in respect of public access to court decisions nor its own caselaw guaranteed the right to obtain anonymised copies of all decisions issued by the commission over a lengthy period according to the constitutional courts caselaw access had to be given to the judgments delivered by the highest courts which dealt with cases raising important legal issues however this did not apply to all the commissions decisions ii relevant domestic law and practicea the information act the information act regional law gazette regulates the duty of the authority to provide information section provides as follows the authority of the land municipalities municipal associations and any other selfgoverning bodies regulated by regional law are under an obligation to provide anyone with information about their sphere of competence unless provided otherwise in section information is the notification of existing knowledge on matters known to the authority at the time it provides the information section in so far as relevant provides as follows anyone may require authorities of the land municipalities municipal associations and any other selfgoverning bodies regulated by regional law to provide information orally in writing or by phone telex or telegraph section in so far as relevant provides as follows no information shall be provided if the provision of such information is contradictory to a statutory duty of confidentiality there is no duty to provide information ifc the provision of information would require investigations calculations or preparations considerably impinging on the proper fulfilment of the authoritys other tasks b the tyrol real property transactions act the aim of the tyrol real property transactions act as in force at the material time regional law gazette as amended by regional law gazette was to preserve land for agricultural and forestry use and to avoid the proliferation of second homes contracts concerning the transfer of ownership and certain other rights relating to agricultural or forest land therefore required approval by local real property transactions authorities appeals against their decisions could be lodged with the commission either by the parties if they considered the decision had violated their rights or by the regional real property transactions referee grundverkehrsreferent if he considered that the decision ran contrary to the public interest a complaint could be lodged with the constitutional court against decisions of the commission relating to the transfer of agricultural and forest land if approval was declined the transfer of land was null and void the regional real property transactions commission was composed of nine members and substitute members who were appointed for five years and were not bound in the exercise of their functions by any instructions as a rule the commission held oral hearings in public an annual report on the situation of real property transfers in tyrol published by the regional government includes a report containing general information on the commissions activities it can be seen from these reports that in the period from to between and appeals per year were lodged with the commission the majority of which concerned transfers of agricultural and forest land it can also be seen that the commission issued decisions in decisions in decisions in decisions in decisions in and decisions in the,,,
59,the applicant company is a limited liability company established under austrian law with its registered office in innsbruck it publishes bezirksblatt lokalausgabe hall rum the bezirksblatt a weekly newspaper distributed free of charge in a region of tyrol one edition of the newspaper had copies circulated in january approximately copies of an anonymous letter were sent out many of them to members of the supervisory board of the tourism association for hall and wattens two towns in tyrol the letter written in the form of a survey concerned cm and jm referred to as mm on account of the initial letter of their surname cm was at the time a practising lawyer and chairman of the tourism association for hall and wattens when the article was published elections for the post of chairman of the tourism association were underway and cm was again standing as a candidate for the post his brother jm also a practising lawyer had been active in politics in hall for many years and was at the material time the member of the city council responsible for public finance he was also chairman of the supervisory board of stadtwerke hall the towns electricity water and heating supplier the survey part of the letter read in the course of our mm survey i would like to ask you the following questions would you buy a car from this man would you stake your money on a promise made by this man does this man have the necessary personal professional qualifications has this man ever built anything properly is this man honest with his own family would you allow this man to execute your will if you have answered one of these questions with no please ask yourself why you want to leave this man in his current position we being entrepreneurs will decide at the next tourism association meeting with our votes it is our promise our money our qualification our association and our heritage l a journalist working for the applicant companys newspaper was informed of the anonymous letter he telephoned cm and jm who commented on it claiming it to be part of a political campaign against them a few minutes later cm telephoned the journalist back and asked him whether he was planning to publish the letter when l confirmed that he was cm said that he did not agree to its publication and that he would take legal action if it were published in the january issue of the bezirksblatt the applicant company published an article entitled anonymous campaign against mm the subheading read mm or cms and jms full surname are the target of a not at all bittersweet campaign the article contained the story of the anonymous letter and cms and jms replies to the accusations made in it it reported that both of them had stated that the letter had attempted to harm their political activities and had considered the accusations to be a personal insult the article contained photos of cm and jm and a reproduction of the letter containing the questions set out above relying on section of the media act cm and jm brought proceedings against the applicant company for defamation requesting compensation and publication of the judgment the applicant company argued that its conduct did not amount to defamation as the article had only quoted someone elses statements and had duly distanced itself from the contents of the letter moreover the information had been a matter of public interest on march the innsbruck regional court found in favour of the claimants and ordered the applicant company to publish the judgment and to pay eur in compensation to each of them the regional court held that the article itself merely commented on the letter in an objective manner and did not agree with its offensive content furthermore the nature of the offices held by the claimants meant that they were often in the local media but had so far not been the subject of any negative campaign however the anonymous letter which had been included in the article fulfilled the actus reus of defamation as it accused cm and jm of dishonesty and other disreputable character traits relating to both their professional and private lives both had experienced negative repercussions as a result of the article in their professional activities as lawyers in that they had repeatedly been confronted with the allegations made in the anonymous letter the regional court referring to the applicant companys argument that it had only quoted a statement made by someone else noted that section of the media act only permitted quoting the statement of a third person if the quotation was truthful and there was an overriding public interest in its publication this rule would even apply if the identity of the third person having made the statement was unknown in any case the court held that it was required to balance the public interest in disseminating information about the statements quoted against the claimants interest in protecting their reputation it accepted that the local public had an interest in knowing about a campaign against the chairman of the tourism association and a local politician however public interest did not justify reproduction of the anonymous letter in the article the applicant company could have provided information on the campaign against cm and jm without printing the defamatory letter in that connection the court observed that by printing the letter the applicant had also made its entire content known to a far greater number of people than the letter itself had reached the applicant company appealed and lodged a plea of nullity relying on the media act in particular on the socalled law on quotations developed under section of that act it asserted that the regional court had wrongly considered there to be no overriding public interest in publishing the anonymous letter in particular the article and the letter related to the tourism association which was a public law corporation and the applicants were both public figures in local politics the innsbruck court of appeal dismissed the appeal on august it held that the law on quotations was not applicable in the present case it was not possible to claim for damages under article of the media act in respect of quotations in the media where the identity of the third person making the offensive statements was known in such cases the person concerned could seek compensation from the person who had made the offensive statements in the first place as in the present case the person who had made the offensive statements had remained anonymous the applicant company could not rely on section of the media act furthermore the court of appeal confirming the regional courts view found that in any event there was no overriding public interest in publication of the anonymous letter the judgment was served on the applicants counsel on january ii relevant domestic law and practice section of the media act provides for the strict liability of the publisher in cases of defamation the victim can thus claim damages from the publisher section in so far as material reads as follows where a medium publishes statements which constitute the actus reus of disparagement insult derision or defamation the victim shall have a claim against the owner of the medium publisher for damages for the injury suffered the right referred to in paragraph above shall not apply in the case of defamationa where the statements published are true orb where there was an overriding public interest in publication and the requisite journalistic diligence having been observed there were sufficient reasons to believe that the statement was true where a truthful quotation of a statement made by a third person is concerned and there was an overriding public interest in knowing about the statement quoted for the purpose of section of the media act defamation is to be understood as defined in article of the criminal code strafgesetzbuch which reads as follows anybody who in such a way that it may be noticed by a third person attributes to another a contemptible characteristic or sentiment or accuses him of behaviour contrary to honour or morality and such as to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six months or a fine anyone who commits this offence in a printed document by broadcasting or otherwise in such a way as to make the defamation accessible to a broad section of the public shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine the person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true in the case of the offence defined in paragraph he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to believe that the statement was true the,,,

disclosure of confidential information to a journalist in flagrant breach of his terms of employment although the mo u did not specifically refer to article it had its essence in mind given the terms in which it was drafted and the manner in which it was reasonable to assume that it had been given effect journalistic privilege did not preclude newspapers from voluntarily disclosing the identity of a source on may the judge refused the application he acknowledged that there was a reasonable inference that mgn had assisted the police with its investigation in the hope that its actions would avoid prosecutions at a higher level however he concluded that the applicant had failed to establish any breach of article he accepted the prosecution submission that the mo u had been drafted with the essence of article in mind and that disclosure had been justified under article he further noted that journalistic privilege did not preclude a newspaper from voluntarily disclosing the identity of a source submission of no case to answer at the close of the prosecution case the applicant sought a ruling from the judge that there was no case to answer on the basis that the four essential elements of the offence had not been made out see paragraph below on may the judge refused the application he found that in respect of each element of the offence there was evidence on which it would be open to a jury to be sure that this element was made out he considered that the fact that the applicant had chosen to have cheques for the first twentyseven transactions made out to his son who transferred the equivalent amount into the applicants bank account was capable of giving rise to the inference that the applicant knew very well that what he was doing was wrong and in breach of duty as to whether the applicant had a reasonable excuse or justification for his action the judge found it open to the jury to conclude that he did not having regard to the number of stories involved the length of time over which information was divulged the amount of money involved and the fact that the applicant had not taken up any matters which featured in the stories through official channels despite his claims to have been concerned for reasons of public interest in respect of the seriousness test the judge took the view that a jury could conclude that the necessary harm to the public interest had been established by the very fact of a prison officer having been in a longstanding relationship with a journalist and in breach of his duty repeatedly divulging information about the prison for money conviction and sentence on june the applicant was convicted by the jury the following day he was sentenced to twenty months imprisonment in his sentencing remarks the judge accepted that the applicant had had genuine concerns about the manner in which the prison was being run this he considered had been in part a motivating factor for his actions the judge continued that said in my judgment that does not tell the whole story on a number of occasions as you yourself conceded in evidence you disclosed information when the public interest had nothing at all to do with what you were imparting the judge considered that the applicant had been motivated by money and by an intense dislike of the prison governor he further pointed out that the applicant had been a tradeunion representative and could have used official channels to disseminate information had public interest been his sole concern as to the harm caused by his actions the judge referred to the suspicion that had fallen on other innocent members of staff since the identity of the person leaking stories was unknown he also highlighted the damage to prisoners who had been demonised in the tabloid stories as well as the resulting potential for enmity from other inmates and inmates general mistrust of prison staff because of the leaks finally the fact that for a lengthy period of time and on numerous occasions the applicant had acted in flagrant breach of rules which the judge was satisfied he knew very well prohibited such contacts with the press represented a very serious breach of trust in sentencing him to a term of imprisonment the judge emphasised the scope and scale of the offending in the case the court of appeal the applicant sought leave to appeal against conviction and sentence his application for leave to appeal against sentence was refused on september on september he was granted leave to appeal his conviction in his written argument prior to the appeal hearing he advanced two grounds of appeal first he argued that the trial judge had erred in failing to stay the prosecution as an abuse of process see paragraphs above disclosure of his name as a journalistic source had breached article because mgn had been acting under pressure and because the disclosure process had not been prescribed by law as it had lacked the necessary safeguards second he argued that the judge should have acceded to his submission of no case to answer see paragraphs above he contended that his misconduct did not meet the criminal threshold but amounted rather to a disciplinary offence and the appropriate article compliant sanction would therefore have been disciplinary proceedings not a criminal prosecution he added that the criminal prosecution of a disciplinary offence offended the principle of legal certainty and thus violated article of the convention on october the court of appeal dismissed the appeal in its judgment it listed the stories for which the applicants information was said to have been the source which it noted ranged from general stories in which individuals generally remained anonymous to specific or personal stories in which prisoners or staff were named or identifiable the court noted at the outset that all of the caselaw of the european court of human rights cited in argument was concerned with the compulsory disclosure of journalistic sources or materials it found no evidential basis for the applicants suggestion that the police had exerted any improper pressure on mgn to disclose information in particular the comments of the trial judge regarding the newspapers hope that their assistance would avoid prosecution at a higher level see paragraph above merely recorded the motivation of the newspapers it did not amount to a finding that the police had sought to impose any pressure on them indeed the court said all the evidence suggested the reverse it explained the police made no threat or promise express or implied about the bringing of a prosecution against the company or companies or their top management the police were seeking voluntary disclosure under the terms of the mo u clause of which made clear that mgn retained the right to invoke article grounds for refusing disclosure mgn was a large organisation with access to inhouse and external legal advice it was inconceivable that mgn did not give careful consideration to whether to make disclosure to the police in the context of the publicity which operation elveden and the leveson inquiry were attracting the police were entitled to assume that the disclosure which was proffered was as a result of a considered and informed decision with the benefit of full and accurate legal advice the court concluded that the disclosure had not been procured by any improper pressure or coercion but had been truly voluntary there had therefore been no misconduct by the police in receiving or acting upon the information the court further rejected the argument that voluntary disclosure was a breach of the applicants article right as a journalistic source to have his anonymity maintained it considered that there was room for doubt whether the applicants article rights were engaged at all in these circumstances referring to council of europe recommendations see paragraphs below it noted that while the right of journalists to withhold journalistic material was an important article right there was no concomitant obligation on journalists to do so the court also noted that the edition of the editors code of practice described a journalists obligation to protect confidential sources of information as a moral obligation see paragraph below in the event the court did not find it necessary to decide the point since even if such a right existed it was not unqualified assuming in the applicants favour that article was engaged the court was satisfied that the use of the material in his prosecution in the circumstances of his case was compatible with article the freedom of expression which potentially fell within article was the provision of information in return for the corrupt acceptance of money by him as a public official over a prolonged period which amounted to the serious criminal offence of misconduct in public office revelation of the applicants wrongdoing was necessary and proportionate for the important public interest of prosecuting a crime which existed in this context to maintain the integrity and efficacy of the prison service and the publics confidence in it the court then turned to examine the second ground of appeal that the trial judge should have acceded to his nocasetoanswer submission it observed that while the challenge before the trial court had been that the prosecution case had been insufficient to be left to the jury in respect of all four elements of the offence see paragraph above on appeal the argument had been confined to the second and third elements see paragraph below only as to the seriousness test the third element the court agreed with the findings of the trial judge see paragraph above it considered that the prosecution evidence was capable of meeting the high threshold of criminality because of the harm to the public interest caused by the applicants conduct in this respect the court referred to the extent of the applicants corrupt activity taking payments of over gbp for a period of some five years was conduct that the jury had been entitled to conclude was not justified in the public interest it was also conduct that caused significant public harm because corruption of a prison officer on this scale undermined public confidence in the prison service the court further referred to the impact of the leaks from an unknown source on trust and morale among and between prisoners and staff and the deterrent effect on staff and prisoners reporting incidents as regards the second element of the test the applicants argument was that what he had done had been in accordance with the freedom of expression protected by article and it could not therefore amount to a breach of duty the court disposed of this argument on the basis that the applicants conduct amounting to the serious offence of misconduct in public office was not protected by article lastly the court dealt briefly with the article point see paragraph in fine above which it noted had not been pursued in oral argument it concluded that there was no lack of certainty in the seriousness element of the offence of misconduct in public office it had recently been clearly articulated and explained in attorney generals reference no of and r v chapman and others see paragraphs below in the latter case it had been made clear that the level of seriousness which had to be reached was defined by recognised criteria on which the jury were to be directed the seriousness test was therefore sufficiently clear to enable a person with appropriate legal advice if necessary to regulate his behaviour and foresee whether such behaviour was capable of amounting to misconduct in public office the supreme court the applicant applied for leave to appeal to the supreme court relying on articles and of the convention on january the court of appeal refused to certify a point of law of general public importance and refused leave to appeal relevant legal framework and practicedomestic law and practicemisconduct in public office the elements of the offence misconduct in public office is a commonlaw offence not defined in statute it carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment the leading modern case defining the offence is attorney generals reference no of ewca crim in which the court of appeal at paragraph stated that the elements of the offence were a public officer acting as such wilfully neglects to perform his duty andor wilfully misconducts himself to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the publics trust in the office holder without reasonable excuse or justification as regards the seriousness test the court explained the threshold is a high one requiring conduct so far below acceptable standards as to amount to an abuse of the publics trust in the office holder a mistake even a serious one will not suffice the motive with which a public officer acts may be relevant to the decision whether the publics trust is abused by the conduct the element of culpability must be of such a degree that the misconduct impugned is calculated to injure the public interest so as to call for condemnation and punishment it will normally be necessary to consider the likely consequences of the breach in deciding whether the conduct falls so far below the standard of conduct to be expected of the officer as to constitute the offence the conduct can not be considered in a vacuum the consequences likely to follow from it will often influence the decision as to whether the conduct amounted to an abuse of the publics trust in the officer a default where the consequences are likely to be trivial may not possess the criminal quality required a similar default where the damage to the public or members of the public is likely to be great may do so the consequences of some conduct such as corrupt conduct may be obvious the likely consequences of other conduct of public officers will be less clear but it is impossible to gauge the seriousness of the defaulting conduct without considering the circumstances in which the conduct occurs and its likely consequences in the light of operation elveden and the resulting criminal investigations the director of public prosecutions issued cps guidelines for prosecutors on assessing the public interest in cases affecting the media on september the guidance specifically referred to article of the convention and emphasised that prosecutors were required to take the right to freedom of expression including the right to receive and impart information into account when taking decisions on whether to prosecute in march the court of appeal considered the ambit of the offence in the case of r v chapman and others ewca crim where one of the issues before the court was whether the trial judges direction concerning the threshold of seriousness had been correct the court referred to attorney generals reference no of see paragraph above and noted that it had not been suggested that this formulation of the law was in any way inaccurate it considered that there were two ways in which the jury might be assisted to assess seriousness the first was to refer them to the need for them to reach a judgment that the misconduct was worthy of condemnation and punishment the second was to refer them to the requirement that the misconduct had to be judged by them as having had the effect of harming the public interest on the latter the court went on to explain in our view in the context of provision of information to the media and thus the public that is the way in which the jury should judge the seriousness of the misconduct in determining whether it amounts to an abuse of the publics trust in the office holder the jury must in our view judge the misconduct by considering objectively whether the provision of the information by the office holder in deliberate breach of his duty had the effect of harming the public interest if it did not then although there may have been a breach or indeed an abuse of trust by the office holder visàvis his employers or commanding officer there was no abuse of the publics trust in the office holder as the misconduct had not had the effect of harming the public interest no criminal offence would have been committed in the context of a case involving the media and the ability to report information provided in breach of duty and in breach of trust by a public officer the harm to the public interest is in our view the major determinant in establishing whether the conduct can amount to an abuse of the publics trust and thus a criminal offence for example the public interest can be sufficiently harmed if either the information disclosed itself damages the public interest as may be the case in a leak of budget information or the manner in which the information is provided or obtained damages the public interest as may be the case if the public office holder is paid to provide the information in breach of duty the law commission project the law commission was set up for the purpose of promoting the reform of the law in it began a project on the offence of misconduct in public office its reform objectives were to decide whether the offence of misconduct in public office should be abolished retained restated or amended it published an issues paper on january launching the first phase of the consultation process appendix c to the paper is entitled misconduct in public office and the echr it identified the definition of the seriousness test as being one of the main difficulties from the perspective of article of the convention the paper continued c this question was the main focus of the recent court of appeal decision in chapman here the seriousness test was compared to the test in gross negligence manslaughter which also has difficulties in terms of circularity and uncertainty the court felt that it is not helpful for a jury to be told that the breach of duty must be so serious as to amount to a criminal act and sought to solve this difficulty by applying another method of determining whether the conduct was so serious it held that the jury must be referred to the requirement that the misconduct must be judged by them as having the effect of harming the public interest unfortunately the concept of public interest is not one with consensus as to its meaning and therefore may not be a much clearer basis for the test the law commission concluded in so far as relevant that the seriousness test was illdefined and vague and that since it was a core element of the offence the law might be incompatible with article of the convention paragraph c in the second phase of the consultation process the law commission published consultation paper no of september reforming misconduct in public office and invited responses it explained that in the light of the responses received it intended to decide on its final recommendations and present them to government at paragraph of the paper the law commission noted that numerous problems had been identified including an abuse of the publics trust is crucial in acting as a threshold element of the offence but is so vague that it is difficult for investigators prosecutors and juries to apply the paper continued paragraph the lord chief justice lord thomas reiterated recently in the case of chapman that the legal position is that an abuse of the publics trust is one that has the effect of harming the public interest however it remains unclear what role if any factors such as consequences and impropriety of motive will play in the assessment of harm to the public interest we consider that the difficulties currently experienced with the definition of seriousness in the offence are unlikely to be resolved by the courts without a more fundamental review of this element of the offence there are two problems with this element first the jury is being asked to make a circular assessment of whether an individuals breach of duty is serious enough to be criminal it is criminal because it is serious it is serious because it is criminal secondly this may be compounded by the fact the jury is being asked to do so without any clear indication of what could amount to serious and therefore criminal misconduct the lack of comprehensive guidance as to what makes misconduct serious causes difficulties for investigators prosecutors judges and juries it is particularly difficult in terms of making decisions as to where the line should be drawn between disciplinary and criminal proceedings the law commissions final report and recommendations were published on december in its report it repeated its concerns as to the difficulties a jury may have in applying the seriousness criterion overall as regards the commonlaw offence it concluded in summary we consider the following to be the main concerns it is not clear in all cases whether a person might be subject to the offence as the category of public office is not defined with sufficient precision this creates problems in practice including erroneous charging decisions and successful appeals and may offend article of the european convention on human rights the fault element that must be proved appears to vary depending on the circumstances of the case creating additional complexity and leading to costly appeals the seriousness threshold that the offence amounts to an abuse of the publics trust is highly subjective and difficult to apply this has led to concern that the offence is being pursued in some circumstances that are not sufficiently blameworthy so as to justify criminal consequences there is a general lack of definition in the scope and subject matter of the offence which has led to its application in contentious contexts the law commission accordingly recommended the abolition of the commonlaw offence and its replacement with two statutory offences corruption in public office and breach of duty in public office duties related to employment in the prison service rule of the prison rules provides no officer shall make directly or indirectly any unauthorised communication to a representative of the press or any other person concerning matters which have become known to him in the course of his duty article of the civil service code provides civil servants must not misuse their official position or information acquired in the course of their official duties to further their private interest or those of others they should not receive benefits of any kind from a third party which might reasonably be seen to compromise their personal judgment or integrity protection of journalistic sources clause of the editors code of practice of the independent press standards organisation is entitled confidential sources and provides journalists have a moral obligation to protect confidential sources of information international law and practicecouncil of europe recommendation no r recommendation no r on the right of journalists not to disclose their sources of information was adopted by the committee of ministers of the council of europe on march it sets out in an appendix principles concerning the right of journalists not to disclose their sources of information principle provides that domestic law should provide for explicit and clear protection of the right of journalists not to disclose information identifying a source in accordance with article of the convention pursuant to principle the right of journalists not to disclose information identifying a source must not be subject to other restrictions than those mentioned in article of the convention according to principle journalists should be informed by the competent authorities of their right not to disclose information identifying a source as well as the limits of this right before a disclosure is requested council of europe recommendation recommendation of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on the protection of journalists sources was adopted on january paragraph provides public authorities must not demand the disclosure of information identifying a source unless the requirements of article paragraph of the convention are met and unless it can be convincingly established that reasonable alternative measures to disclosure do not exist or have been exhausted the legitimate interest in the disclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in the nondisclosure and an overriding requirement of the need for disclosure is proved at paragraph the assembly welcomes the fact that journalists have expressed in professional codes of conduct their obligation not to disclose their sources of information when they receive information confidentially it explains that this professional ethical standard ensures that sources may rely on confidentiality and decide to provide journalists with information which may be of public concern it invites journalists and their organisations to ensure through selfregulation that sources are not disclosed the,,,
61,the applicant was born in and lives in góis a background of the proceedings at the relevant time the applicant was a chief corporal in the national republican guard guarda nacional republicana working at the góis territorial post on november the applicant sent an email to the general inspectorate of internal administration inspecção geral da administração interna on the subject suspected misuse of money in which he made reference to an alleged misuse of money by commander mc of the arganil territorial post in accordance with what he had heard in a conversation with colleagues at the arganil territorial post he asked the general inspectorate to investigate the alleged facts stating as follows in the month of december the coimbra national republican guard territorial group distributed money to the territorial posts of its area of command for the christmas dinner the only members of the military in arganil who attended the dinner were the commander of the post and corporal m the total amount of money that had been given to the military from the territorial post to pay for the dinner was paid to the restaurants manager in exchange for a receipt it seems that the commander has since then been going with his family to the mentioned restaurant where the cost of his meals is deducted from the money that was not spent on the above dinner note i have just become aware of this matter through rumours within the military of the mentioned post who claim that they have not reported the situation for fear of reprisals and because of that fear of reprisals i ask you for secrecy during the investigation because i am also a member of the military on an unknown date the general inspectorate of internal administration forwarded the email to the general command of the national republican guard comando geral da guarda nacional republicana and to the lousã public prosecutors office ministério público on an unknown date the lousã public prosecutors office opened an investigation into the applicants allegations on february the lousã public prosecutors office discontinued the proceedings on the grounds that following investigations by the criminal investigation police policía judiciária it had found no evidence of the criminal offence denounced by the applicant the general inspectorate of internal administration also conducted an inquiry into the applicants allegations on june the inquiry was discontinued the general command of the national republican guard also started an internal inquiry into the allegations on december on december commander mc was heard in that respect he then became aware of the email of november and its content on february the inquiry was converted into disciplinary proceedings against commander mc at the request of the official in charge of the inquiry on the grounds that the management of the cafeteria of the arganil territorial post showed signs of lack of transparency which required further investigation on july the disciplinary proceedings against commander mc were discontinued on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to take disciplinary action the decision to discontinue the disciplinary proceedings also took into account the decision of the lousã public prosecutors office to discontinue the criminal proceedings against commander mcb criminal proceedings against the applicant on april commander mc lodged a criminal complaint before the lousã public prosecutors office accusing the applicant of defamation he alleged that the applicants email had disseminated injurious statements about him on july the public prosecutor brought charges acusação against the applicant for aggravated defamation on the grounds that the statements made in his email called into question commander mcs honesty honour and professional reputation which the applicant had intentionally attacked on september commander mc lodged a claim for damages against the applicant in the amount of euros eur in a judgment of january the lousã criminal court convicted the applicant of aggravated defamation and sentenced him to eighty dayfines totalling eur euros the applicant was also ordered to pay eur in damages to commander mc the court described its findings of fact and the manner in which it had assessed the evidence and held as follows since the existence of such a rumor has not been proved in any way the court is fully convinced that the defendants intention was to undermine the honour of the offended party once he knew that this was just a rumour and that therefore he was making an allegation that was not true the allegation made in the defendants complaint by its content put into question the offended partys honesty honour and professional reputation as commander of a territorial post of the national republican guard which was well known to the defendant the defendant has therefore acted in a free voluntary and conscious way with the achieved aim of attacking the offended partys honour and personal and professional reputation the disclosure of irregular situations has to be seen as a duty as the performance of an obligation when it falls within the competence and responsibilities of the whistleblower and when it does not go beyond the facts which were effectively observed whistleblowing can not be used as a basis to cast suspicion which can not be supported by any factual element in the instant case the defendant accuses the offended party of facts which are objectively dishonorable without having any evidence to substantiate them indeed by submitting that the offended party and his family were using the existing credit to have dinner at the mentioned restaurant the defendant knew that he was accusing the offended party of a dishonorable deed all the more because he knew that the offended party was in charge of the national republican guards arganil territorial post he further knew that the allegation was inconsistent with the truth and that he could easily have clarified its authenticity with the restaurant owner through such conduct the defendant acted of his own free will and in the knowledge that his actions were not allowed on an unknown date the applicant appealed against the judgment to the coimbra court of appeal in particular he contested the established facts as in his opinion he had not acted with the intention of attacking commander mcs honour and reputation on september the coimbra court of appeal upheld the firstinstance courts decision it considered that there were no reasons to change the facts established by the firstinstance court and as such no reasons to reach a different conclusion with regard to the applicants guilt and conviction c disciplinary proceedings against the applicant on august the general command of the national republican guard instituted disciplinary proceedings against the applicant on february the official in charge of the inquiry within the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant submitted a final report in which he concluded that the applicant had breached his duties the relevant passage of the report reads as follows the defendant breached the duty of loyalty as being on duty and being part of the góis territorial post in the quality of deputy commander of the post he did not inform his hierarchical superiors in clear disregard of the functional hierarchy principles of the acts allegedly committed in the report it was also taken into account that the applicants allegations had been investigated by different authorities all of which had discontinued their investigations additionally it had regard to the fact that the applicant had been convicted by the domestic courts in the criminal proceedings against him the report further analysed the existence of a fine which commander mc had imposed on the applicant before the latter had sent the impugned email however the official responsible for the report considered that fact to be innocuous and irrelevant on march at the request of the official responsible for the disciplinary proceedings the general command imposed on the applicant a disciplinary sanction consisting of suspension from duty for six days its enforcement being suspended for a period of twelve months according to the material submitted in the case file it seems that the applicant did not lodge an appeal against the disciplinary sanction with the minister of home affairs ii relevant domestic lawa relevant provisions of the portuguese criminal code article anyone who when addressing a third party accuses another

throughout the country as he is the main suspect in a case of breaking and entering at the headquarters of the psd in suceava sa aged is suspected of being one of the organisers of the burglary of the local headquarters of the governing party committed at the end of last year the night before christmas eve was marked by bad luck for the psd in suceava as thieves visited their headquarters on the morning of december some of the members of this party arrived at the headquarters located in the centre of suceava and noticed that the headquarters had been ravaged after checking inside they realised there had been a burglary and that the thieves had stolen two televisions and approximately rol while searching for valuables the thieves vandalised the offices breaking all the doors and yanking the televisions from the electric sockets following an investigation by the suceava police the main suspect was identified as sa who has been missing from his place of residence since that date sa see photo fled in order to avoid criminal investigation for the offence of aggravated theft and so a general search has been instituted and his photograph has been sent to judicial service police officers throughout the country in a case where someone tries to avoid getting nicked pârnaie by fleeing despite being sought by the police a countywide search is launched if the person is not found within ninety days the police launch a national search in a case where there is information that the person has left the country an international arrest warrant is issued and the arrest of the fugitive is only a matter of time following the publication of the article the father of sa sent a letter to the newspaper which read as follows to the editor of monitorul de suceava the undersigned ad found out from your newspaper that there was a national and local search order for my son as for the offence of aggravated theft regarding the content of the article i can tell you that at the time my son was neither in the country nor in suceava county as he was in italy the employees of the suceava county police inspectorate promptly informed me that there had been a mistake and that the general search for my son had been called off the document confirming this information is available to the public from the suceava judicial service my wish would be to have the article retracted this letter was published in the newspaper on august b firstinstance proceedings on september sa lodged with the suceava district court a criminal complaint against the applicant for the offence of defamation as prescribed at the time by article of the romanian criminal code after explaining that at the time of the theft he was in italy and thus it was impossible for him to have participated in the alleged offence he mentioned that once his father had found out about the article he had written to the newspaper asking that it be retracted the letter was published unedited but nothing else was done since then sa considered that the article contained serious allegations which considerably affected his public image causing him personal suffering he therefore requested that those responsible be convicted and ordered to pay him nonpecuniary damages in the amount of rol in his defence the applicant submitted that the information concerning the general search for sa as well as the photograph of sa were given to him on august by the suceava judicial service and thus there had been no reason for him to doubt it he contended that at the time of the publication the general search order issued in respect of sa was valid he further argued that he did publish a retraction in the newspaper namely the letter of sas father on october the head of the police department of suceava informed the firstinstance court that in response to your letter in which you enquire whether on august a general search order was outstanding against sa i wish to inform you that on december by order no of the general inspectorate of the romanian police a general search order was issued in respect of this person as he was attempting to avoid criminal investigation while under suspicion of theft the measure was revoked by order no s of the general inspectorate of the romanian police on september after clarification of sas situation on november the court acquitted the applicant of the charge of defamation however it ordered the applicant to pay jointly with the newspaper the sum of rol to sa the relevant excerpts from the judgment read as follows taking into account the fact that the applicant obtained information concerning the suspect from the judicial office within the general police inspectorate he can not be found to have deliberately mens rea defamed the plaintiff under the civil limb of the action defamation concerns public communication of a distorted negative image of a person which is likely to cause him or her personal suffering and damage to reputation leading to changes such as social embarrassment and injury to selfesteem the firstinstance court considers that publishing the article in the newspaper caused damage to the standing of the civil party moreover it must be noted that although the civil partys father notified the newspaper that the facts published about his son were false the newspaper did not publish a retraction of the article written by the defendant c appeal proceedings by a final judgment of january the suceava county court rejected an appeal by the applicant and upheld the firstinstance courts judgment the court stated in its reasoning the following even though there is no mens rea as far as the offence of defamation provided for in article of the criminal code is concerned given the source of information at the date of the publishing of the article the defendants obligation to pay compensation to the civil party can not be set aside this is because following the discovery of the error he did not publish a retraction in order to try to rectify it the article caused nonpecuniary damage to the civil party which can be repaired only in the manner established by the firstinstance court ii relevant domestic law the relevant

the committee of ministers under the terms of article b of the statute of the council of europe recommends that member states in consultation with private sector actors and civil society develop and promote coherent strategies to protect freedom of expression access to information and other human rights and fundamental freedoms in relation to search engines in line with the convention for the

engine providers to carry out the following actions enhance transparency regarding the way in which access to information is provided in order to ensure access to and pluralism and diversity of information and services in particular the criteria according to which search results are selected ranked or removed review search ranking and indexing of content which although in the public space is not intended for mass communication or for mass communication in aggregate this could include listing content sufficiently low in search results so as to strike a balance between the accessibility of the content in question and the intentions or wishes of its producer for example having different accessibility levels to content which is published seeking broad dissemination as compared to content which is merely available in a public space default settings should be conceived taking account of this objective iii filtering and deindexing context and challenges a prerequisite for the existence of effective search engines is the freedom to crawl and index the information available on the internet the filtering and blocking of internet content by search engine providers entails the risk of violation of freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention in respect to the rights of providers and users to distribute and access information search engine providers should not be obliged to monitor their networks and services proactively in order to detect possibly illegal content nor should they conduct any ex ante filtering or blocking activity unless mandated by court order or by a competent authority however there may be legitimate requests to remove specific sources from their index for example in cases where other rights outweigh the right to freedom of expression and information the right to information can not be understood as extending the access to content beyond the intention of the person who exercises her or his freedom of expression in many countries search engine providers deindex or filter specific websites at the request of public authorities or private parties in order to comply with legal obligations or at their own initiative for example in cases not related to the content of websites but to technical dangers such as malware any such deindexing or filtering should be transparent narrowly tailored and reviewed regularly subject to compliance with due process requirements action member states should ensure that any law policy or individual request on deindexing or filtering is enacted with full respect for relevant legal provisions the right to freedom of expression and the right to seek receive and impart information the principles of due process and access to independent and accountable redress mechanisms should also be respected

court of justice of the european union cjeu was called upon to interpret directive ec it found that the activity of an internet search engine was to be classified as the processing of personal data within the meaning of directive ec and held that such processing of personal data by the operator of a search engine was liable to affect significantly the fundamental rights to privacy and to the protection of personal data as guaranteed under articles and of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union oj c when a search by means of that engine was carried out on the basis of an individuals name since such processing enabled any internet user to obtain through the list of search results thus attained a structured overview of the information relating to that individual that could be found on the internet and thereby to establish a more or less detailed profile of him or her furthermore the effect of such interference on the rights of a data subject would be heightened on account of the important role played by the internet and search engines in modern society which rendered the information contained in such a list of results ubiquitous in the light of the potential seriousness of that interference it could not be justified merely by the economic interest of the operator the cjeu held that a fair balance had to be sought between the legitimate interest of internet users in having access to such information and the data subjects fundamental rights it deemed that a data subjects fundamental rights as a general rule overrode the interests of internet users but that that balance might however depend on i the nature of the information in question and its sensitivity as regards the data subjects private life and ii the interest of the public in having that information the cjeu held that in certain cases the operator of a search engine was obliged to remove from the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of a persons name any and all links to internet pages published by third parties and containing information relating to that person even when the publication of that information on the internet pages in question

member states may have different approaches as to the public availability of information about offenders and their offences specific legal provisions may exist which have an impact on the availability of such information over time dpas will handle such cases in accordance with the relevant national principles and approaches as a rule dpas are more likely to consider the delisting of search results

64,the applicant was born in and lives in helsinki the applicant is a photographer and journalist for the weekly magazine suomen kuvalehti on september he was sent by his employer to take photographs of the demonstration which was being held in protest against the ongoing asia europe meeting asem in helsinki the demonstration was an exceptionally large one in the finnish context and all media followed it closely before the demonstration took place on august the helsinki police department was alerted by the finnish security intelligence that the upcoming smash asem demonstration would be a hostile one and would not aim to highlight any clear political message the police department did not manage to establish contact with the organisers of the demonstration the demonstration was to start at pm on september a separate area was reserved for the representatives of the media so that they could freely and safely observe the situation and take photographs on the demonstration place at the start of the demonstration bottles stones and jars filled with paint were thrown at public and policemen some demonstrators kicked and hit police officers the police announced several times over loudspeakers that a peaceful demonstration was allowed on the spot but that the crowd was not allowed to demonstrate by marching the crowd tried to break through the police defence line relying on all the information in their possession the police decided to interrupt the demonstration which had now turned violent the police announced over loudspeakers that the demonstration was stopped and that the crowd should leave the scene this announcement was repeated several times hundreds of people then left voluntarily after the escalation of violence the police considered that the event had turned into a riot and decided to seal off the demonstration area first only a few people were allowed to leave the area then the police established several exit routes and people were allowed to leave when leaving they were asked to show id and their belongings were checked however the core group of around people remained in one of the demonstration spots including the applicant and a former member of parliament all of whom had been asked to leave the scene failing which they would be arrested according to the applicant he thought that this request only applied to the demonstrators he claims that sometime later he indicated to the police that he was a representative of the media he further claims that he was wearing his press badge and that a police officer accepted this after having called his colleague the applicant decided to stay until the situation was over a short time later the police arrested the demonstrators when leaving the scene the applicant was also arrested the police

been in the sealedoff area had been able to leave the scene without consequences just before the applicant was arrested the court found it further established that the police orders had been clear and that they had clearly concerned everybody the court balanced the article right against other interests finding that the police had had the right to ask the applicant among others including the former member of parliament to leave the scene the interference with the applicants right to exercise his freedom of expression had thus been based on law and it had fulfilled the legitimate aim of preventing disorder the interference had been necessary in a democratic society in order to put an end to a violent situation however relying on chapter section of the penal code no penalty was imposed as the offence was excusable the court found that the applicant who as a journalist was confronted with contradictory expectations stemming from obligations imposed on the one hand by the police and on the other by his employer by letter dated january the applicant appealed to the helsinki court of appeal hovioikeus hovrätten claiming that the district court should have dismissed the charges against him he argued that his arrest and the fact that he was found guilty were against the constitution and article of the convention the applicant was a journalist and that he had not participated in the demonstration or caused any disorder the district court had not reasoned why his arrest and conviction were necessary in a democratic society and had thereby failed to justify the

written after the applicant had approached the newspaper with criticism of the new army disciplinary statute adopted by the lithuanian seimas almost unanimously a couple of months previously in the article the applicant argued that the new disciplinary statute restricted a servicemans defence rights when he was the subject of disciplinary proceedings in particular the statute was vague on servicemens right to acquaint themselves with the substance of any internal investigation report against them the applicant also claimed that during disciplinary proceedings a serviceman had only a limited opportunity to have recourse to legal representation which in his view was particularly harmful since few servicemen had the proper legal knowledge to defend themselves in person the article further stated that the applicant discontented with the new statute had conveyed his observations and suggestions to the president of the republic asking the latter to veto the statute according to presidential office sources the president took account of the applicants proposals but decided to promulgate the statute anyway the chairman of the committee of national security of the seimas commented that the committee had received numerous suggestions in connection with the text of the statute all of which had been given serious consideration before the statute was adopted on march the

investigation into the actions of the applicant was terminated on march it was established that the applicant had had prior permission from his superiors to address the state president however he had not obtained permission to contact the newspaper the army investigator nevertheless considered that as cited in the article war without constitutional rights the applicant had been expressing only his own personal opinion and had not disseminated any official information consequently article of lms applied pursuant to which soldiers had a right to express their opinions unless there was a conflict with their duties as soldiers or with military discipline no disciplinary penalties were imposed on the applicant on may the applicants superiors concluded that the applicant had failed to perform his duties as a legal advisor namely he had recommended the commanding officer of his battalion to grant childcare leave to another soldier rv in breach of applicable legal norms the army imposed upon the applicant a disciplinary penalty drausminę nuobaudą namely a reprimand papeikimąon appeal against this penalty on april the supreme administrative court held that the applicant had acted lawfully and

the vilnius regional administrative court asking it to quash the decision of july and to reinstate him into professional military service the applicant also claimed that he had been discriminated against because he had defended another serviceman see paragraph above and because of his views as expressed in the publication in kauno diena in breach of article of the convention the applicant asserted that there were hundreds of soldiers in the lithuanian army who did not have speciality codes allowing them to serve until years of age however they continued to serve in the army until the expiry of their military service contracts even though they had already reached retirement age the applicant thus requested the court on the basis of article of the law on administrative proceedings

legal specialist all officers with lawyers duties were given the code of legal specialist but the applicant a noncommissioned officer had not been given a legal specialist code this meant that at that time he had no legal specialist code at all the administrative courts found that under the applicable legislation the applicant was obliged before he could bring a court action to exhaust other nonjudicial remedies namely to lodge an appeal with the minister of defence the applicant then appealed to the minister of defence against his discharge from the army on august the ministry of defence

soldier from the military notwithstanding whether or not his military service contract had expired yet ruling of march in case no a the court further observed that article of lms gave the minister of defence discretion to extend in the interests of the military the professional military service of a soldier who had reached the age when he or she should be discharged however this was a matter of discretion and placed no obligation on the minister the court did not address the applicants argument that four other servicemen of his unit had been allowed to continue military service despite having reached the age of discharge nor did it reply to the applicants request for the military service records of those four servicemen in the meantime the applicant also lodged a complaint with the ombudsman challenging his discharge from the army on november the ombudsman refused to examine the complaint on the ground that an identical complaint was being examined by the administrative courts and the law did not allow the ombudsman to deal with such complaints on november the applicant appealed to the supreme administrative court reiterating his arguments of unlawful dismissal and discrimination his appeal statement indicates that he reiterated his request that his superiors in the grand duke vaidotas battalion be ordered to produce certain documents from the military service records of the four servicemen mentioned above who he stated had continued serving in the same unit as the applicant despite having reached retirement age the applicant asserted that discrimination would be easy to prove if the court would help him to obtain the military service records of those four servicemen as regards the military specialist codes he noted that in august he had been granted specialist code on the basis of the military code system established by the minister of defence in thus allowing him to serve until the age of after the minister of defence amended the military code system in the applicant was given military specialist code when in the minister of defence again changed the system of military specialist codes and the applicant was transferred to the post of legal specialist no specialist code was assigned to him the applicant observed that officers who had legal posts had been given the code of legal specialist but that he as a noncommissioned officer did not have such a code above all at present no specialist code at all had been granted to him šiuo metu iš viso man nėra suteiktas joks specialisto kodas lastly the applicant strongly asserted that the lower court had erred in interpreting and applying article and other provisions of lms by a decision of may the supreme administrative court dismissed the appeal in setting out the reasons it observed that pursuant to article of lms a serviceman had to be dismissed from military service once his contract had expired or he had reached the age of discharge unless the duration of his military service had been extended in the applicants case as a noncommissioned officer the age of discharge for him was the court also emphasised that that legal norm was imperative and applied to contracts which were still valid and not to those which had already expired teisės norma skirta reglamentuoti teisinius santykius dėl galiojančios o ne pasibaigusios karo tarnybos sutarties nutraukimo this interpretation also followed from article of lms which provided that a contract could be annulled ahead of time in cases provided for in article of that law moreover the possibility of the applicants military service contract being rescinded had also been mentioned in the contract itself see paragraph above taking into account the imperative nature of article it was the army commands duty and not a right to rescind a contract once the conditions mentioned in that provision had been met furthermore article of lms provided only discretion for and not an obligation on the minister of defence to extend a servicemans military service the supreme administrative court also noted that according to his duties the applicant did not fall into the sphere regulated by article and of the law that is he did not have military specialist status moreover exceptional extension of term of service under article had not been applied to him consequently the facts of the case fully matched the circumstances listed in articles and of the law the firstinstance courts decision was thus fully upheld the appellate court did not address the applicants request for the supplementary documents to be obtained nor did the court deal with the allegation of discrimination against the applicant because of his service status in addition to the administrative proceedings concerning his discharge from military service the applicant also instituted another set of somewhat linked proceedings concerning his dismissal from vaidotas battalion which formally preceded the discharge from military service he reiterated the arguments expressed in the earlier proceedings in relation to freedom of expression the applicant merely mentioned that he had been persecuted for his opinions because of the legal decision he had issued which was favourable towards another serviceman see paragraph above it also appears from the summary of the applicants complaints in the record of the court decision of july see the next paragraph that this time the applicant had made no reference to the publication in kauno diena but insisted that he had been discriminated against because of his social status as a noncommissioned officer visàvis the commissioned officers on july the vilnius regional administrative court dismissed the applicants claim fully upholding the reasoning that in accordance with articles and of lms the army was under an obligation to discharge him from the military because of his age the court also noted that the qualifications required for a legal post had been established by the minister of defence on june one of the obligatory requirements was universitylevel higher education in law aukštasis universitetinis teisinis išsilavinimas accordingly the applicant was not qualified to be appointed to a legal post because in he had graduated from šiauliai college of law and management from the programme of higherlevel nonuniversity law studies aukštųjų neuniversitetinių teisės studijų programa as regards the alleged discrimination against noncommissioned officers visàvis commissioned officers the court observed that different requirements were applicable to soldiers of different ranks to reflect their experience and qualifications as had been established in article of lms similarly by a ruling of october no the government had approved the regulations on military service tarnybos statutas point of which established that all lithuanian military officers are in command of soldiers and noncommissioned officers visi karininkai yra kareivių ir puskarininkių ir liktinių viršininkai given that legal acts established different social status for officers and noncommissioned officers the same requirements could not apply to both the court thus held that the applicants argument that he had a right to serve until years of age and was not to be discharged from the army was based only on his own ideas and erroneous interpretation of the law lastly the court dismissed the applicants claim that he had been persecuted for his opinions having concluded that that claim was based only on the applicants own suppositions and guesses the applicant appealed arguing that he had been persecuted because of his opinion on whether to grant childcare leave to another soldier it appears from the transcript of the hearing of his complaints in the appellate court decision that the applicant did not mention the publication in the kauno diena newspaper on may the supreme administrative court dismissed the appeal noting that the applicants claim had already been decided in another administrative case by a decision of may see paragraphs and above the court confirmed that article of lms provided for two alternatives when a soldier had to be discharged from the army when his contract expired or emphasised by the appellate court when he reached the age stipulated in article of that law accordingly once a serviceman reached the retirement age the army had an obligation and not a right to discharge him the court also noted that it was free to assess evidence to establish the circumstances of the case however the applicant had not provided any evidence confirming that he had been persecuted for the opinion he had given on the grant of childcare leave to another soldier the applicant has been receiving a military pension since july b the four servicemen who served in the same grand duke vaidotas battalion as the applicant it appears from the parties explanations and the documents presented that the situation of the four servicemen whom the applicant had

was valid until october at the age of he was honourably retired from the army in december on the basis of articles and of lms having reached the statutory age which is for a major however it appears

applicant to desist from labelling abortions such as those performed by dr q aggravated murder on february the karlsruhe court of appeal granted the sought injunction the court held that the applicants website led it to be understood that abortions performed by dr q constituted aggravated murder while the term aggravated murder did not have to be understood in a merely legal sense but

court of khabarovsk the district court complaining that the police authorities had failed to provide him with the information he had requested and requesting for access relying on the information act

magazine entitled fakty i mity in the magazine published an article signed anna tarczynska written by the journalist msz it concerned allegations of unlawful dealings between the lódź public prosecutors office and various criminals involved in drug trafficking its opening paragraphs read as follows an elite group of prosecutors trusted by minister z the then minister of justice are suppressing the truth about a colleague of theirs involved in drug trafficking we presume that the minister is not a drug addict even though he sometimes does look bizarre we also presume that the prosecutors said to be his most trusted collaborators are not junkies why then do they tolerate among themselves a wellknown prosecutor in łódź who is involved in drug trafficking thats how the state creates an army of janissaries the woman in question will now do whatever they want knowing what they can accuse her of on the other hand they might be afraid that she will go public with some charges because it is obvious that she did not consume almost one kilogram of amphetamines herself some time ago gossip was going around the town that the prosecutors amuse themselves at their parties by taking amphetamines an officer of the central investigation office centralne biuro śledcze explains to us but the woman is the most important person in the story prosecutor anna currently works in the investigation division of the łódź regional prosecutors office as recently as april she was hailed in the media and at receptions as a spokesperson of the appellate prosecutors office shortly after prosecutor b became the chief of the latter she disappeared from public view and someone else replaced her the real reason for her disappearance from the public scene was fully understandable for a narrow circle of insiders namely prosecutors who knew the details of investigations concerning a wellknown case involving the disappearance of drugs stored as physical evidence by the prosecution the article went on to describe a drugtrafficking transaction on an unspecified date in a street in łódź referring to statements by two anonymous witnesses charged with drug trafficking referred to as witness no and witness no they stated that they had handed over the drugs to mk who at the material time had been married to prosecutor anna the beauty of it was that at the transaction scene mk had his own security mk came to the scene in a blue renault clio driven by a woman it turns out that it was prosecutor anna who being present in the car throughout the transaction provided a guarantee of security for her former husband in the meantime mk disappeared even though we do not believe that he had been kindly forewarned that he would be arrested the fact remains that prosecutor m stayed the proceedings against his colleagues husband prosecutor anna is unreachable even though the secretariat in the investigation division told us repeatedly that she was in her office she never picked up the phone subsequently the prosecutor described in the article as prosecutor anna brought a civil claim against the applicant company and against rk its president and editorinchief of the magazine she claimed protection of personal rights within the meaning of articles and of the civil code by a judgment of september the łódź regional court allowed the claim and ordered the applicant company jointly with the magazines editorinchief to publish an apology in the magazine it was to be published once and was to read as follows the editors of fakty i mity apologise to ms atk prosecutor at the łodź regional prosecutors office for breaching her personal rights through publishing in its issue no in october untrue information namely that she had links with criminal circles involved in drug trafficking for slandering her with allegations of aiding and abetting drug dealing and for suggesting that criminal proceedings had been instituted against her they were also ordered to pay polish zlotys pln to the claimant as compensation for the breach of her personal rights the court established that the claimant had married mk in the marriage had been in difficulties since approximately her former husband was a businessman he had experienced considerable financial problems since at least the de facto breakdown of their marital life had occurred in the claimant did not know anything about her husbands professional activities the family had one car used essentially by the claimants former husband for business purposes however he often drove their daughter to school and the claimant to the office so that they did not have to use public transport in he left poland the parties divorced in the impugned article referred to the claimant as prosecutor anna and referred to her function as the prosecutors office spokesperson the court was of the view that it made her identity obvious to any reader familiar with legal circles in łódź it was furthermore stated in the article that on an unspecified date she had accompanied her former husband to a meeting held somewhere in a street in łódź a certain sw remanded in custody at the time of publication of the article had told ms ohb a researcher for the magazine about that transaction in which he had been involved together with pt a suspect in another set in criminal proceedings pt was also remanded in custody at the time of publication pt had been the claimants former husbands business partner since approximately he had never met the claimant but had known that she was a prosecutor the journalist msz who wrote the article using a pseudonym had failed to take into consideration the fact that sw was remanded in custody and that he had therefore had an interest in blackening the prosecutors name since she had been involved in certain cases against him his statements should therefore not have been taken at face value ms ohb had met sw in prison posing as a relative however neither the journalist nor the editor had taken any steps with a view to contacting pt in order to obtain information from him that would have corroborated sws allegations the court found that the author had failed to make reasonable efforts to contact the claimant before publication the efforts on the part of the researcher and the journalist to get in touch with her had been completely inadequate all the more so given that they were seasoned professionals the journalist maintained that he tried to call the claimant at her office at least fifty times but the evidence available to the court did not support his statement it was further noted that other journalists had managed to contact her via her office which cast doubt on the veracity of his statement no reasonable grounds had been adduced to demonstrate that it had not been possible for the defendants to get in touch with a wellknown prosecutor working at a publicly known address namely that of the prosecutors offices the court noted that the claimant had acted as a prosecutor in certain criminal cases against sw and pt in criminal proceedings against them in which they had been convicted of drug trafficking they had told the court that they had sold g of amphetamines to the prosecutors former husband in the presence of an unknown blonde woman who was allegedly waiting in the car the criminal court noted that sw had told the court that the claimants former husband had informed him at the time of the transaction that the woman with him was his wife the civil court observed that the identity of that woman had never been corroborated by any other evidence when questioned before the civil court sw stated that he had seen the woman for a matter of seconds and remembered that she was blonde but did not recognise the claimant the court further observed that the claimants former husband against whom criminal proceedings were pending at that time had gone into hiding and it had been impossible to establish his whereabouts in order to make him testify in the case the court found having heard three witnesses from the claimants professional working environment that the impugned article made her identity obvious to anyone working in prosecutors offices and to the police in łódź the article had given rise to numerous comments and conversations it was regarded as an attempt to blacken the claimants name and to slander her motivated by the wish to damage her reputation and call into question her moral standing and professional principles it was noted that she had been attacked by a criminal who had provided information to the journalists concerning his own criminal case after the article was published many people did not know how to behave towards the claimant or what to think of her an embarrassing silence descended when she joined in conversations the claimant had suffered serious stress and had felt seriously wronged by the impugned article the court concluded that the article breached the claimants personal rights blackened her reputation and exposed her to difficulties and disrepute in her professional and social life it lacked objectivity and was onesided its tone was unduly sensationalist and it presented mere conjecture as hard facts the court reiterated that a person exercising a public office should accept that his or her activities were to be assessed by the public opinion and had to accept public criticism it noted that freedom of expression could not be understood as arbitrariness it referred to the provisions of section of the press act which obliged journalists to present true facts to the public the court further relied on numerous judgments of the supreme court by which that court had stressed that journalists were obliged to exercise particular diligence when gathering material and publishing articles such diligence was called for inter alia as regards the obligation to check the veracity of information obtained from third parties in the present case such diligence had not been exercised while it was true that the claimants former husband had purchased amphetamines from sw and pt no evidence had been presented to the court to show that the claimant had been present at the scene let alone acting as security for the transaction the court observed taking due note of the financial statements of the applicant company for that it was in a good financial position and that pln in damages was therefore an appropriate award in the circumstances of the present case the court questioned the journalist msz the researcher ms ohb pt sw and three other witnesses as to the impact that the article had had in the claimants professional environment the court referred to a note and an email from the prosecutors office listing the people who had tried to contact the claimant by phone and to the list of phone calls made to her office the applicant company appealed referring inter alia to article of the convention it submitted that the firstinstance court had erred in holding that the impugned article breached the claimants personal rights given that the defendant had been motivated by the desire to protect socially justified interests that the court had refused to take evidence from the files of two criminal cases with a view to establishing that the claimant had been present at the scene of the transaction and that the court had been arbitrary in establishing that the claimant had not known either what her former husband did for a living or the purpose of the meeting in the street that the information contained in the article had made it possible for readers to identify the claimant and that she had been ostracised by her colleagues as a result of the article by a judgment of december the łódź court of appeal dismissed the appeal it shared the conclusions of the lower court as to the applicant companys failure to act with the diligence which could and should be expected of journalists it stressed that the journalist and the researcher had failed to seek information that could have countered their version of events or dispelled doubts as to the facts it endorsed the lower courts conclusion that the transaction itself had indeed taken place but that the claimants alleged involvement in it had been presented in a tendentious and unreliable manner the court referred to article of the convention and held that the interference was necessary as the applicant company had breached the claimants rights through its insinuations which were not based to any reasonable degree on the available evidence on january the supreme court dismissed the applicants company cassation appeal it observed that the impugned article concerned an event which had indeed occurred namely a drugtrafficking transaction between the claimants former husband and pt and sw however the allegations that the claimant had knowingly participated in that transaction as well as insinuations that she was a drug addict and that she had been passing on drugs on her fellow prosecutors were in the light of the evidence gathered in the case entirely unfounded her rights had been thereby breached the supreme court referred to its own caselaw to the effect that journalists were obliged to be diligent when gathering material for the purposes of their articles but that at the same time they had a right to draw their own conclusions from material thus gathered i ck the press act obliged them to comply with the obligation of diligence by contacting persons about whom they wished to write prior to the publication of such material i csk such an obligation was all the more important in the present case because given the claimants prosecutorial function in cases against pt and sw the testimony of the latter could not be accepted uncritically the journalists had failed to try to contact the claimant had accepted sws statements in an undiscriminating manner and had failed to contact pt prior to publishing the article the supreme court acknowledged that shocking or even insulting publications were also covered by the protection of article of the convention however this protection was not absolute it could be limited by the legitimate aims listed in paragraph of this provision journalists making allegations about individuals were obliged to show that there was sufficient factual basis for their assertions here it referred to cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no echr xi not only should statements of fact be consistent with the material gathered for the purposes of the press articles but value judgments should also have a sound factual basis here it cited dąbrowski v poland no december these principles were equally applicable to situations where the administration of justice or judges or prosecutors were criticised by the press citing barfod v denmark february series a no prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no and lešník v slovakia no echr iv the supreme court reiterated that informing the general public of improper conduct on the part of public prosecutors served the general interest but the guarantees enshrined in article could be successfully relied on only where journalists had reliable and precise information at their disposal that could justify levelling such serious charges against public officials no such factual information had been put forward by the defendants in the present case the courts had not therefore

69,in and lives in viviers he was represented by mr c meyer a lawyer practising in strasbourg the luxembourg government the government were represented successively represented by an ad hoc agent mr christophe schiltz head of the legal department of the secretariat general at the ministry of foreign affairs and subsequently by their agent mr david weis of the permanent representation of luxembourg to the council of europe the background to the case the applicant was employed by the company pricewaterhouse coopers pw c which provides auditing tax advice and management consultancy services pw cs activity consists in particular in drawing up tax declarations in the name and on behalf of its customers and in requesting advance tax rulings from the tax authorities these rulings which concern the application of fiscal law to future operations are known as advance tax agreements atas tax rulings or tax rescripts they are referred to below as tax rescripts the applicant submits that while employed by pw c he coordinated a fiveperson team and held a post which was not minor but on the contrary was at the heart of pw cs activity which consisted in obtaining the best possible treatment for its clients from the luxembourg tax authorities this description is challenged by the government which relying on the findings that the trial court in the present case would reach submit that at the relevant time the applicant carried out the tasks of an administrative employee and that his duties consisted in gathering centralising scanning saving and dispatching tax declarations to the clients concerned between and several hundred tax rescripts and tax declarations prepared by pw c were published in various media outlets these publications draw attention to a practice over the period from to of highly advantageous tax agreements concluded between pw c on behalf of multinational companies and the luxembourg tax authorities an internal investigation by pw c established that on october the day before he left pw c following his resignation an auditor ad had copied pages of confidential documents including pages of tax documents corresponding to folders of tax rescripts he had handed these over to a journalist ep in the summer of at the latters request a second internal investigation by pw c led to the applicants identification following the medias disclosures about certain of the tax rescripts copied by ad the applicant had contacted ep in may offering to hand over other documents the journalist eventually agreed to this offer and the sixteen documents specifically fourteen tax declarations and two covering letters were handed over between october and december some of these documents were used by the journalist in a second television programme cash investigation broadcast on june a year after the first broadcast on and november the sixteen documents were also put online by an association of journalists known as the international consortium of investigative journalists icij its authors described this publication as luxleaks it appears from press articles that the luxleaks affair led to a difficult year for pw c but that once this period had passed the company experienced a growth in turnover which was accompanied by a significant increase in its workforcethe criminal proceedings brought in the case on a complaint by pw c ad the applicant and ep were charged by an investigating judge and committed for trial before the luxembourg district court by the investigating court the firstinstance judgment on june the luxembourg district court ruling on major offences convicted ad and the applicant of theft from ones employer vol domestique fraudulent access to a system for the processing or automatic transmission of data betrayal of commercial secrets breach of professional confidence and laundering and possession blanchimentdétention ad was sentenced to a twelvemonth prison term suspended in its entirety and to a fine of euros eur the applicant was sentenced to a ninemonth prison term suspended in its entirety and a fine of eur in addition they were ordered to pay a symbolic sum of one euro to pw c as civillaw compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage pw c having limited its claim as the civil party to that amount ep was acquitted on the grounds that he had not taken part for the purposes of the law as a coperpetrator or accomplice in the applicants betrayal of commercial secrets or breach of professional confidence judgment of the court of appeal ad and the applicant lodged criminallaw and civillaw appeals against the above judgment the public prosecutor lodged a criminallaw appeal against the same judgment in respect of the ad the applicant and ep on march the court of appeal of the grand duchy of luxembourg delivered its judgment before analysing the merits of the case the court of appeal noted that the applicants public accusations through communication of the tax declarations of multinational companies were related to the practice initially criticised by ad of issuing tax rescripts that were advantageous to these multinational companies in the same context it also stated that under the caselaw of the european court of human rights the lawfulness or illegality of the disclosed act or conduct is not a criterion in decided whether to grant whistleblower status since the disclosed information might even concern a particular shortcoming or questionable practices as to the merits the court of appeal decided for various reasons related to the domestic criminal law not to examine certain charges brought against ad or the applicant namely breaching commercial secrecy or accordingly laundering and possession or laundering and possession of the proceeds of computerrelated fraud it ruled that in the light of the domestic criminal law alone the firstinstance court had been correct in finding that ad and the applicant had committed the offences of theft from ones employer fraudulent or retained access to a data processing or automatic transmission system breach of professional confidence and laundering and possession of the proceeds of theft from ones employer it held that contrary to the findings of the firstinstance court ep ought to have been regarded as complicit in the breach of professional confidence committed by the applicant and in the laundering and possession of the proceeds of theft from ones employer also committed by him the court of appeal then examined whether or not these offences which had been established and were in principle to be considered as proven could be held to be justified under article of the convention it explained that under luxembourg law the acceptance of whistleblowing as a defence derived from article of the convention had the effect of neutralising the illegal nature of the breach of the law it specified that it was the statutory element of the offence which was necessarily committed through the disclosure in good faith and in a proportionate and appropriate manner of information in the general interest which was thus neutralised and led to the defendants acquittal with regard to ep it held that he was to be recognised as enjoying the defence of having acted as a responsible journalist derived by the court from article of the convention in consequence it confirmed on this ground eps full acquittal with regard to ad and the applicant it applied the courts caselaw on the protection of whistleblowers referring in particular to guja v moldova gc no echr it reiterated that this caselaw made protection of whistleblowers subject to compliance with six conditions which it then analysed its reasoning may be summarised as follows analysis of the first four guja criteria the court of appeal noted in application of this caselaw that the revelations were in the public interest the first criterion in that they had opened the way for a public debate in europe and luxembourg about the taxation of multinational companies fiscal transparency the practice of tax rescripts and tax fairness in general it added that following the luxleaks disclosures the european commission had presented a range of measures against tax evasion and an action plan for fair and effective corporate taxation in the european union the court of appeal also held that the information disclosed had been authentic the second criterion with regard to the third criterion namely that disclosing the information to the public could only be considered as a last resort where it was clearly impracticable to do otherwise the court of appeal considered that having regard to the circumstances of the case informing the public through the media had been the only realistic alternative in order to raise the alert it accepted that the fourth criterion that of good faith had been met in the applicants case in the case of ad it held that this criterion had been complied with in the summer of when he handed over the documents which he had taken in october to ep in contrast it held that ad had not complied with this criterion when taking possession of the documents given that he had not yet intended at that point to make them public analysis of the fifth guja criterion the court of appeal then analysed the criterion which required the public interest in obtaining the information to be balanced against the harm suffered by the employer as a result of the information revealed the fifth criterion in so far as the applicant argued that pw c had not suffered any harm pointing out that the company had even announced an increase in its turnover and number of employees the court of appeal after reviewing the courts various judgments in this area noted as follows the european court does not analyse the harm sustained in specific terms but considers that the harm caused to the employer may result from damage to its image loss of confidence and in general from the impact that the report may have had on the public the higher the public profile of the case and thus of the information that the employer wished to keep secret the more the publics confidence is shaken it also stated there is accordingly no need to ascertain whether as a result of ads and the applicants disclosures pw cs turnover has decreased or whether clients have complained brought civilliability proceedings or closed their accounts with pw cthe court of appeal notes that the fact of disclosing documents subject to business and professional secrecy has certainly caused harm to pw c specifically nonpecuniary harm as a victim of criminal offences resulting from the damage to its reputation and the loss of client confidence with regard to the security procedures in place in the company furthermore and more specifically in the context of the information provided concerning the applicant it pointed out that in the present case pw c has been associated with a practice of tax evasion if not with a taxoptimisation procedure described as unacceptable it has been the victim of criminal offences and has necessarily suffered harm it went on to weigh up the public interest on the one hand against pw cs interests on the other and found with regard to ad that the public interest clearly outweighed any harm that may have been sustained by pw c and its clients it therefore held that this criterion had been complied with in respect of ad in contrast in the applicants case the court of appeal held that the disclosure of the documents had caused pw c harm that was greater than the general interest with the result that the fifth criterion had not been fulfilled it found that the defence argument that the applicant should be granted whistleblower status could not be accepted for the following reasons the documents handed over by the applicant to the journalist did not contribute to the public debate on the luxembourg practice of tax rescripts trigger a debate on tax evasion or provide essential new and previously unknown information in reaching this conclusion it relied on the following arguments in contrast to the documents disclosed by ad the documents selected by the applicant were not administrative rulings and did not illustrate the application of the tax rescripts system they were simple tax declarations that is unilateral statements by taxpayers concerning their financial situation which did not permit the tax authorities attitude towards them to be ascertained thus these documents did not reveal any information about the tax optimisation technique and were of limited relevance nor had they been selected by the applicant in order to provide additional information about the tax rescripts already in the possession of ep for example in order to illustrate how these tax rescripts were reflected in the corresponding tax declarations they had been selected solely on the basis of how wellknown the relevant taxpayer was when the applicant appropriated the documents and transmitted them to the journalist the practice of tax rescripts had already been disclosed through the documents which were transmitted by ad and publicised on the occasion of the first cash investigation programme the applicant had been aware of this circumstance thus there had been no compelling reason for the applicant to commit a fresh violation of the law by appropriating and disclosing confidential documents the documents had been used by ep to prepare as part of the second cash investigation programme a section on tax evasion and the billions we are missing rather than on the practice of tax rescripts the documents were used to illustrate tax evasion by two groups of multinational companies a and am explored in the report according to ep in the case of company a the tax declarations had allowed him to illustrate that the group had declared a significant turnover in luxembourg without however engaging in the corresponding commercial activity in that country the journalist criticised the following procedure with regard to company am he reported that this group had transferred eur million to a subsidiary governed by luxembourg law in order to repay the interest on a loan that it had granted to this subsidiary the subsidiary was able to deduct the amount in question which was then transferred to another company in the same group located in dubai where it enjoyed full tax exemption the court of appeal considered that the information in relation to the two groups of companies could admittedly be regarded as alarming and scandalous but that it did not constitute essential or fundamentally new information thus it concluded that the tax returns handed over by the applicant merely confirmed the result of the journalistic investigation carried out by eps team and that as such they were certainly useful to the journalist but did not however provide any previously unknown cardinal information capable of relaunching or contributing to the debate on tax evasion analysis of the sixth guja criterion with regard to the sixth criterion concerning the proportionality of the penalty the court of appeal made a distinction between the two defendants it held that ad who was entitled to rely on the defence of whistleblowing with regard to the offence of handing over the documents to the journalist ep in the summer of was to be absolved of any criticism with regard to those events and thus acquitted of the offence of a breach of professional secrecy with regard to those of his actions that were not covered by this defence namely those concerning the appropriation of documents in october the court of appeal reduced the prison sentence to six months suspended in its entirety and upheld the fine of eur with regard to the applicant the court of appeal held that there had been a plurality of offences so that under the domestic criminal law the most severe penalty could be doubled namely a prison term of between three months and five years and a fine of eur to noting also that the applicant could not benefit from the defence of having acted as a whistleblower it decided nonetheless to have regard as an extenuating circumstance to the motive honourable in his view which had driven him to act and to the disinterested nature of his acts in consequence it decided not to impose a prison term and to maintain the fine of eur the court of appeal upheld the civillaw judgment ordering ad and the applicant to pay the symbolic sum of one euro as compensation for the nonpecuniary damage sustained by pw c the court of cassations judgments in respect of ad and the applicant ad and the applicant appealed on points of law against the court of appeals judgment the court of cassations judgment in respect of the applicant in a judgment no criminal division of january the court of cassation dismissed the applicants appeal on points of law the applicant had submitted a legal argument alleging a violation by the court of appeal of article of the convention stating inter alia the court of appeal has misrepresented the facts and the caselaw of the european court of human rights and interpreted in a tendentious manner the limited relevance of the documents handed over to ep leading it to find that the harm suffered by the employer was greater than the general interest and to reject the defence of whistleblowing given its conclusion that the criterion of the proportionality of the harm caused in relation to the general interest was not fulfilled in the discussion of the argument the applicant had emphasised by way of example that the appendices to the tax returns filed by group a see paragraph above referred to annual general meetings which had an average duration of one minute which sufficed to demonstrate a total lack of genuine substance in luxembourg he stressed that the tax returns that he had communicated made it possible to verify the economic reality of the entity set up in luxembourg and thus to analyse the practice of using tax rescripts in response to this argument the court of cassation held inter alia assessment of the facts which must underlie a decision as to whether a defendant can benefit from the defence of whistleblower status falls within the sovereign domain of the judges invested with jurisdiction over the merits and is not subject to review by the court of cassation provided that this assessment is not deduced from reasons that are insufficient or contradictory in the present case the appellate courts based their assessment on the nature of the documents removed by the applicant the use of those documents in the context of a television programme on tax evasion the statements made by the applicant and by ep concerning the relevance of the documents in question and concluded that the tax returns removed by the applicant while they had undoubtedly been useful to the journalist ep did not however provide any cardinal information hitherto unknown that was capable of relaunching or contributing to the debate on tax evasion contrary to the applicants argument the factual findings reached by the appellate courts are not contradictory the appellate courts assessment was thus based on reasons that were adequate and free from contradiction the court of cassations judgment in respect of ad in contrast the appeal on points of law lodged by ad was granted by the court of cassation in its judgment no criminal division of january it quashed the court of appeals judgment on the grounds that whistleblower status ought in principle to be granted concerning all offences for which a person who had availed himself or herself of the right guaranteed by article of the convention was prosecuted failing which the protection that ought to arise from whistleblower status would be rendered ineffective the court of cassation thus held that the court of appeal had infringed article of the convention by refusing to allow ad to rely on the defence of whistleblowing regarding the appropriation of the documents handed over in october given that it had accepted this defence with regard to the handing over of these documents to the journalist ep in the summer of d the court of appeals remittal judgment with regard to ad in a judgment of may the court of appeal held that following the court of cassations judgment ad ought to be acquitted on the basis of article of the convention of all the offences committed with regard to the documents handed over to ep in the summer of including the offences related to the appropriation of these documents in october the court of appeal decided however that the first appellate judgment had become final and thus remained valid in respect of ad concerning these same offences in so far as they related to the internal training documents that he had also appropriated in october when appropriating the tax documents that were subsequently transmitted to ep in this connection it limited itself to suspending the pronouncement of the sentence this judgment was accepted by the parties and consequently became final relevant legal framework and practicerelevant domestic law the various offences with which the applicant was charged are provided for in the criminal code thus the provisions on theft from ones employer vol domestique read as follows article anyone who fraudulently

legislation measures procedures and remedies in order to enable trade secret owners to prevent or obtain redress for the unlawful acquisition use and disclosure of trade secrets however recital of this directive indicates that these measures procedures and remedies should not restrict whistleblowing activity it further specifies that the protection of trade secrets should not extend to cases in which disclosure of a trade secret serves the public interest insofar as directly relevant misconduct wrongdoing or illegal activity is revealed this should not be seen as preventing the competent

and invited the member states of the council of europe which are also members of the european union to adopt its provisions adding that there was nothing to prevent them from protecting those reporting on breaches or abuses of their national law according to the same principles as to the council of europe member states which are not members of the eu the parliamentary assembly invited them to revise their relevant legislation in this area or pass new laws that draw on the proposal for a european directive in question in the second text the parliamentary assembly reiterated its invitation to the committee of ministers to begin preparations for negotiating a binding legal instrument in the form of a council of europe convention which should draw on the abovementioned european directive taking due account of the clarifications and additions proposed in resolution in its reply adopted on april the committee of minsters reiterated with regard to the assemblys recommendation that a legally binding instrument be drawn up the position set out in its reply to assembly recommendation it considered that given the complexity of the subject and the range of solutions adopted by the member states to protect whistleblowers the negotiation of a binding instrument such as a convention would be time consuming and there would be no certainty as to its outcome and that it was at this stage more appropriate to encourage states fully to implement the recommendations which have been adopted by the committee of ministers or other bodies the,,,

october lt the partner of fp became aware of the comments feeling directly and personally insulted by comments that she described as racist associating her forename which sounded north african with the policy of fp she immediately went to the hairdressing salon run by sb whom she knew personally sb who was unaware of the public nature of the applicants facebook account deleted his comment just after lt left as he subsequently confirmed when he was interviewed by the gendarmes on october lt wrote to the nîmes public prosecutor to lodge a criminal complaint against the applicant sb and lr on account of the offending comments posted on the applicants facebook page with her letter she attached screen shots as evidence of the offending comments on october the applicant posted a message on the wall of his facebook account asking users to be careful with the content of their comments but did not do anything about the comments already posted lt was interviewed by the gendarmes on december she stated that she had discovered the comments on october when she was in the office of her partner an mep and first deputy to the mayor of nîmes she explained that their relationship was public knowledge and that the racist comments on the applicants publicly accessible facebook page included one associating her north africansounding forename with that of her partner and his policies she stated that after she had discovered the posts she had immediately gone to the hairdressing salon run by sb to express her indignation according to her sb had been very surprised and had clearly not been aware of the public nature of this facebook page but he had confirmed he was talking about her when he said thanks f and kisses to l she added that she had then been accompanied to the town hall by the prefects wife who was just passing by and who had seen how annoyed she was on the way there she had logged onto facebook again to find that sbs comment had already been removed the investigation into the applicants facebook account revealed on the same day that the comments by lr were still there while those posted by sb had indeed disappeared for his part lr was identified as being an employee of nîmes town council when interviewed by the gendarmes on january he explained that he worked as an assistant in the applicants election campaign and denied that his comments had been racist or an incitement to racial hatred explaining that he had never intended to direct his comments against lt he explained that in the meantime he had deleted the comments in which fp could have recognised himself or have been recognised by others during his interview of january sb told the gendarmes that he had been unaware that the applicants facebook page was publicly accessible and had deleted his comments immediately after lt had come to see him at his hairdressing salon he added that he had informed the applicant later that day of his altercation with lt on january the applicant was also interviewed by the investigators recalling that he had been a candidate in nîmes standing against fp lts partner he explained that he had been unable to monitor the large number of comments posted each week on the wall of his facebook account he indicated in particular that he had not written the impugned comments himself he had not had the time to delete the comment by sb who had already done so he had only become aware of lrs comments when he was summoned to the gendarmerie and he was prepared to delete them if the courts so requested he consulted his facebook wall every day but did not often read the comments which were too numerous given that he had more than friends who could post comments hours a day and that he preferred to post content to inform his readers lt whom he knew only by her partners surname had not been mentioned by name and he had not been aware of her forename until she filed a complaint lt had once personally taken him to task at a polling station she should have telephoned him to ask him to delete these comments which would have obviated the need for a criminal complaint but her aim had clearly been to destabilise his candidature as he was standing against her partner instead lt had gone to the hairdressing salon of sb whom she knew to insult and threaten him in front of witnesses lastly he knew lr and sb activists in his party who did not hold any office in it referring to his foreign origins he added that he had never displayed any racism or discrimination against anyone and that he did not perceive any call to murder or violence in the disputed remarks which he considered to be within the limits of any citizens freedom of expression he emphasised that he had removed public access to his facebook wall a few days before this interview in order to limit access only to those who chose to be his friends and to avoid any further incidents that were not of his making after the interview the investigators were able to confirm that the applicants facebook page was indeed no longer accessible to the public the applicant together with sb and lr were summoned to appear before nîmes criminal court in connection with the publication of the comments in question on the wall of his facebook account to answer charges of incitement to hatred or violence against a group and in particular lt on account of their origin or the fact of belonging or not belonging to a specific ethnicity nation race or religion the summons referred to section first paragraph section eighth paragraph and section of the law of july and section of law no of july in a judgment of february the nîmes criminal court found the applicant sb and lr guilty as charged and ordered each of them to pay a fine of euros eur the applicant was convicted under section first paragraph and section eighth paragraph of the law of july and section of law no of july sb and the applicant were also ordered jointly to pay eur to lt as civil party in compensation for nonpecuniary damage however the court did not see fit to order the sanction of electoral disqualification that had been called for by the public prosecutor in its judgment the court began by finding that the various offending comments had specifically defined the group concerned namely muslims to equate that group with drug dealers and prostitutes who reign supreme riff raff who sell drugs all day long or those responsible for throwing stones at cars belonging to white people was clearly likely on account of both the meaning and scope of the comments to arouse a strong feeling of rejection or hostility towards people who belonged or were assumed to belong to the muslim community it further took the view that lt could be regarded as having been provoked by the impugned comments in view of the references to her partner and the wording thanks f and kisses to l which had had the effect of portraying them both as being responsible for the alleged transformation of nîmes into algiers and to arouse hatred or violence against them as regards the applicant the court observed that it could be inferred from section of the law of july as interpreted by the constitutional council in its decision of september that the criminal liability of the producer of a website intended for communication to the general public including access to messages posted by its users would only be engaged in respect of such messages if it could be established that the producer had been aware of their content before they were posted or if not if he or she failed to act promptly to delete the messages at issue upon becoming aware of them it dismissed the applicants arguments according to which he had not had time to read the comments and that he had not been aware of the comments by sb and lr on the grounds that first comments could only be posted on his wall after he had given access to his friends of which there were at october and that he was responsible for checking the content of the posts second he must have been aware that his page was likely to attract comments with a political and thus essential polemical content and that he should have been all the more careful to monitor them the court concluded that having set up an electronic public communication service on his own initiative for the purpose of exchanging opinions and having left the offending comments which had remained visible as of december according to the investigators the applicant had failed to act promptly to put an end to their dissemination and was therefore guilty in his capacity as principal the applicant and sb appealed sb subsequently withdrew his appeal in a judgment of october the nîmes court of appeal upheld the applicants conviction reducing the fine to eur it further ordered him to pay lt eur in costs for the appeal proceedings in its reasoning the court of appeal held that the criminal court had been correct in finding that the comments clearly defined the group of people concerned namely muslims and that to associate the muslim community with crime and insecurity in the city of nîmes was likely to arouse a strong feeling of rejection or hostility towards that group noting that the legislation cited in the proceedings concerned discrimination against a person or group of persons it found as follows the expression kisses to leila referring to lt and her connection with fp deputy mayor of nîmes who is described in the posts as having contributed to the abandonment of the town of nîmes to the muslims and thus to insecurity is such as to associate her with the transformation of the town and thus to arouse hatred or violence against her on the basis of these elements the two posts in question constitute incitement to hatred or violence against a person namely fps partner lt on account of a presumption because of her forename that she belonged to a muslim community referring further to the provisions of section of the law of july and to the facts of the case the court of appeal noted that there was no evidence that the applicant had been informed of the content of the comments before they were posted but that in his capacity as an elected member of the front national and a public figure he had knowingly made his facebook wall public and had therefore authorised his friends to post comments on it the court continued its reasoning as follows by thus acting voluntarily he became responsible for the content of the comments posted his status as a political figure required him to be all the more vigilant he can not claim not to have been aware of the comments posted on his website on october especially as he stated during the investigation that he consulted it every day he did not however remove the comments which were subsequently deleted by s b himself alerted by the latter to the reaction of the civil party he did not delete lrs comment either and the latter was still present on his website when consulted by the investigators on december he can not be regarded as the court below rightly found as having promptly put an end to the dissemination of the offending comments he legitimised his position by explaining that such comments appeared to him to be compatible with freedom of expression the fact they were left on his wall was thus deliberate on his part in the light of these elements the court below was right to find the defendant guilty as charged and the judgment is upheld in respect of his conviction the applicant appealed to the court of cassation relying in particular on article of the convention in a single ground of appeal he argued that for the offence to be made out the comments had to contain encouragement or incitement to discrimination hatred or violence and not merely give rise to a strong feeling of rejection or hostility towards a group or person that the mere fear of a risk of racism could not deprive citizens of the freedom to express their views on the consequences of immigration in certain towns or neighbourhoods the comments having specifically deplored the transformation of the town of nîmes by immigrants of north african origin and of the muslim faith that the summons to appear before the court had been unlawful and lastly that the impugned remarks had in no way been directed at lt personally and had been distorted by the court of appeal in a judgment of march the court of cassation dismissed his appeal in particular with regard to article of the convention stating as follows first the offence of incitement is established where as in the present case the court finds that by both their meaning and their scope the impugned texts may arouse a feeling of rejection or hostility hatred or violence towards a group or an individual on account of a particular religion second since the abovementioned text falls within the restrictions provided for in paragraph of article of the european convention on human rights the principle of freedom of expression enshrined in paragraph of that article can not be relied upon relevant legal frameworkdomestic law law of july the relevant provisions in force at the material time read as follows section anyone who by uttering speeches cries or threats in a public place or assembly or by means of a written or printed text drawing engraving painting emblem image or any other written spoken or pictorial item sold or distributed offered for sale or exhibited in a public place or assembly or by means of a placard or notice exhibited in a place where it can be seen by the public or by any electronic means of communication to the public has directly incited the perpetrator or perpetrators to commit a serious crime or major offence crime or délit and if the incitement has been acted upon shall be punished as an accomplice in the said offence this provision shall also be applicable where the incitement has been followed only by an attempt to commit a serious crime crime under article of the criminal code section paragraphs and anyone who by one of the means referred to in section has incited discrimination hatred or violence against a person or group on account of their origin or because they belong or do not belong to a given ethnicity nation race or religion shall be liable to a oneyear prison term and a fine of euros or only one of those two sanctions where a conviction is secured for one of the offences provided for in the two preceding paragraphs the court may further ordero the deprivation of the rights listed in paragraphs o and o of article of the criminal code for a maximum of five years save where the offenders liability is engaged under section and the first paragraph of section hereof or under the first three paragraphs of section of law no of july on audiovisual communicationo the display or dissemination of the decision pursuant to article of the criminal code section for the offences délits provided for in the sixth and eighth paragraphs of section section bis the second paragraph of section and the third paragraph of section the limitation period prescribed by section shall be one year section of law no of july on audiovisual communication the relevant provisions as in force at the material time read as follows where one of the offences provided for in chapter iv of the freedom of the press act of july is committed by an electronic means of public communication the publication director or in the situation provided for in the second paragraph of section hereof the codirector shall be prosecuted as the principal when the content of the impugned message has been fixed prior to its communication to the public in the absence thereof the author and failing which the producer shall be prosecuted as principal where charges are brought against the publication director or codirector the author shall be prosecuted as an accomplice any person to whom article of the criminal code is applicable may also be prosecuted as an accomplice where the offence stems from the content of a message addressed by an internet user to an electronic public communication service and made available by that service to the public in a forum of personal contributions identified as such the publication director or codirector may not be held criminally liable as principal if it is established that he or she had no effective knowledge of the message before it was posted on line or if upon becoming aware thereof he or she acted promptly to ensure the deletion of the said message in a decision of september no qpc the constitutional council declared section of law no of july on audiovisual communication to be compliant with the constitution subject to the following consideration consequently taking into account on the one hand the specific liability applicable to the publication director under the first and last paragraphs of section and on the other the characteristics of the internet which as the relevant rules and techniques now stand allow the author of a message disseminated on the internet to preserve his or her anonymity the provisions under review could not without establishing an irrebuttable presumption of criminal liability in breach of the aforementioned constitutional requirements be interpreted as allowing the creator or administrator of an online public communication site enabling messages from internet users to be accessed by the public to be held criminally liable as a producer solely on account of the content of a message of which he or she was unaware before it was posted online subject to that reservation the provisions under review are not contrary to article of the declaration of subsequently in a judgment of october appeal no the criminal division of the court of cassation ruled as follows it can be inferred from section of the law of july that the criminal liability of the producer of an online public communication site enabling messages from internet users to be accessed by the public will only be engaged on account of the content of such messages where it is established that he or she had been aware thereof before they were posted online or that if that were not the case he or she refrained from acting promptly to remove them upon becoming aware thereof however in so deciding without ascertaining whether in his capacity as producer mr x had been aware of the content of the offending message before it was posted online or whether if that were not the case he had refrained from acting promptly to withdraw it as soon as he became aware thereof the court of appeal did not correctly apply section of the amended law of july on audiovisual communication in the light of the abovementioned reservation of the constitutional council the court of cassation had also developed caselaw on the concept of producer adopting this characterisation for a person who had taken the initiative of creating an electronic communication service for the exchange of opinions on predefined topics court of cassation criminal division december bull crim no court of cassation criminal division february bull crim no concerning the liability as producer of the managing director of a company operating a website on account of the dissemination of a number of texts on a discussion forum and court of cassation criminal division february bull crim no concerning the liability as producer of the chair of an association for the dissemination of contentious statements on the latters blog this definition of producer was accepted by the constitutional council which in its decision of september see paragraph above observed it follows from these provisions as interpreted by the court of cassation in its judgments of february that a person who has taken the initiative of creating an online communication service for the exchange of opinions on predefined topics may be prosecuted in his or her capacity as producer furthermore the court of cassation has ruled that the use of the internet is covered by the phrase any electronic means of public communication court of cassation criminal division may bull crim no and court of cassation criminal division may bull crim no while developing caselaw on the concept of publicity which is established when the addressees are not linked to each other by a community of interest and the offending remarks are disseminated via a website accessible to the public court of cassation criminal division february appeal no and march appeal no the court of cassation has thus held that insults posted on the wall of a defendants facebook account which were accessible only to individuals approved by the defendant constituted private and not public insults court of cassation criminal division april appeal no as regards the offence délit of incitement to hatred or violence the court of cassation has consistently held that the comments in question must be such as to arouse immediate reactions from the reader against the persons targeted of rejection or even hatred and violence court of cassation criminal division may bull crim no or that the judges must find that both by its meaning and its scope the text at issue may either arouse a feeling of hostility or rejection or incite the public to hatred or violence against a specific person or group court of cassation criminal division july bull crim no court of cassation criminal division may appeal no court of cassation criminal division may appeal no court of cassation criminal division january appeal no and court of cassation criminal division february appeal nos and comments may also give rise to sanctions if their meaning is implicit court of cassation criminal division july bull crim no furthermore law no of june on the combat against hateful content on the internet and which was the subject of constitutional council decision no dc of june declaring numerous provisions to be unconstitutional created an online hate observatory its mission is to monitor and analyse developments in this area by involving operators in particular of social networks such as facebook associations authorities and researchers concerned with the combat against and prevention of such acts working groups have been tasked with reflecting on the concept of hateful content improving knowledge of this phenomenon analysing the mechanisms of dissemination and the means of combating it and lastly ensuring prevention education and support for internet users the said law also led to the creation of a national unit for combating online hate within the paris tribunal judiciaire which started operating in january it exercises jurisdiction based on the complexity of the procedure or the extent of the breach of public order which may stem in particular from the high media profile or particular sensitivity of a given case circular of november on the combat against online hate crim e international instruments internet communication the relevant texts adopted by the council of europes committee of ministers and the united nations can be found in paragraphs to of the judgment in delfi as v estonia gc no echr hate speech united nationsa human rights council in his report submitted in accordance with human rights council resolution a september the special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression mr frank la rue made the following observations while some of the above concepts may overlap the special rapporteur considers the following elements to be essential when determining whether an expression constitutes incitement to hatred real and imminent danger of violence resulting from the expression intent of the speaker to incite discrimination hostility or violence and careful consideration by the judiciary of the context in which hatred was expressed given that international law prohibits some forms of speech for their consequences and not for their content as such because what is deeply offensive in one community may not be so in another accordingly any contextual assessment must include consideration of various factors including the existence of patterns of tension between religious or racial communities discrimination against the targeted group the tone and content of the speech the person inciting hatred and the means of disseminating the expression of hate for example a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of facebook users does not carry the same weight as a statement published on a mainstream website similarly artistic expression should be considered with reference to its artistic value and context given that art may be used to provoke strong feelings without the intention of inciting violence discrimination or hostility moreover while states are required to prohibit by law any advocacy of national racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence under article of the covenant there is no requirement to criminalize such expression the special rapporteur underscores that only serious and extreme instances of incitement to hatred which would cross the sevenpart threshold should be criminalized in other cases the special rapporteur is of the view that states should adopt civil laws with the application of diverse remedies including procedural remedies for example access to justice and ensuring effectiveness of domestic institutions and substantive remedies for example reparations that are adequate prompt and proportionate to the gravity of the expression which may include restoring reputation preventing recurrence and providing financial compensation in addition while some types of expression may raise concerns in terms of tolerance civility and respect for others there are instances in which neither criminal nor civil sanctions are justified the special rapporteur wishes to reiterate that the right to freedom of expression includes forms of expression that are offensive disturbing and shocking indeed since not all types of inflammatory hateful or offensive speech amount to incitement the two should not be conflatedb committee on the elimination of racial discrimination general recommendation no of september on combating racist hate speech provides guidelines on the requirements of the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination the aim being to help the states parties to fulfil their obligations it is indicated in particular as follows racist hate speech addressed in committee practice has included all the specific speech forms referred to in article directed against groups recognized in article of the convention which forbids discrimination on grounds of race colour descent or national or ethnic origin such as indigenous peoples descentbased groups and immigrants or noncitizens including migrant domestic workers refugees and asylum seekers as well as speech directed against women members of these and other vulnerable groups in the light of the principle of intersectionality and bearing in mind that criticism of religious leaders or commentary on religious doctrine or tenets of faith should not be prohibited or punished the committees attention has also been engaged by hate speech targeting persons belonging to certain ethnic groups who profess or practice a religion different from the majority including expressions of islamophobia anti semitism and other similar manifestations of hatred against ethnoreligious groups as well as extreme manifestations of hatred such as incitement to genocide and to terrorism stereotyping and stigmatization of members of protected groups has also been the subject of expressions of concern and recommendations adopted by the committee racist hate speech can take many forms and is not confined to explicitly racial remarks as is the case with discrimination under article speech attacking particular racial or ethnic groups may employ indirect language in order to disguise its targets and objectives in line with their obligations under the convention states parties should give due attention to all manifestations of racist hate speech and take effective measures to combat them the principles articulated in the present recommendation apply to racist hate speech whether emanating from individuals or groups in whatever forms it manifests itself orally or in print or disseminated through electronic media including the internet and social networking sites as well as nonverbal forms of expression such as the display of racist symbols images and behaviour at public gatherings including sporting events on the qualification of dissemination and incitement as offences punishable by law the committee considers that the following contextual factors should be taken into account the content and form of speech whether the speech is provocative and direct in what form it is constructed and disseminated and the style in which it is delivered the economic social and political climate prevalent at the time the speech was made and disseminated including the existence of patterns of discrimination against ethnic and other groups including indigenous peoples discourses which in one context are innocuous or neutral may take on a dangerous significance in another in its indicators on genocide the committee emphasized the relevance of locality in appraising the meaning and potential effects of racist hate speech the position or status of the speaker in society and the audience to which the speech is directed the committee consistently draws attention to the role of politicians and other public opinionformers in contributing to the creation of a negative climate towards groups protected by the convention and has encouraged such persons and bodies to adopt positive approaches directed to the promotion of intercultural understanding and harmony the committee is aware of the special importance of freedom of speech in political matters and also that its exercise carries with it special duties and responsibilities the reach of the speech including the nature of the audience and the means of transmission whether the speech was disseminated through mainstream media or the internet and the frequency and extent of the communication in particular when repetition suggests the existence of a deliberate strategy to engender hostility towards ethnic and racial groups the objectives of the speech speech protecting or defending the human rights of individuals and groups should not be subject to criminal or other sanctions informed ethical and objective media including social media and the internet have an essential role in promoting responsibility in the dissemination of ideas and opinions in addition to putting in place appropriate legislation for the media in line with international standards states parties should encourage the public and private media to adopt codes of professional ethics and press codes that incorporate respect for the principles of the convention and other fundamental human rights standards the council of europea the committee of ministers the annex to recommendation no r of the council of europes committee of ministers on hate speech adopted on october provides in particular as follows scope the principles set out hereafter apply to hate speech in particular hate speech disseminated through the media for the purposes of the application of these principles the term hate speech shall be understood as covering all forms of expression which spread incite promote or justify racial hatred xenophobia anti semitism or other forms of hatred based on intolerance including intolerance expressed by aggressive nationalism and ethnocentrism discrimination and hostility against minorities migrants and people of immigrant origin principle the governments of the member states public authorities and public institutions at the national regional and local levels as well as officials have a special responsibility to refrain from statements in particular to the media which may reasonably be understood as hate speech or as speech likely to produce the effect of legitimising spreading or promoting racial hatred xenophobia anti semitism or other forms of discrimination or hatred based on intolerance such statements should be prohibited and publicly disavowed whenever they occur principle national law and practice should allow the courts to bear in mind that specific instances of hate speech may be so insulting to individuals or groups as not to enjoy the level of protection afforded by article of the european convention on human rights to other forms of expression this is the case where hate speech is aimed at the destruction of the rights and freedoms laid down in the convention or at their limitation to a greater extent than provided therein principle national law and practice should allow the competent prosecution authorities to give special attention as far as their discretion permits to cases involving hate speech in this regard these authorities should in particular give careful consideration to the suspects right to freedom of expression given that the imposition of criminal sanctions generally constitutes a serious interference with that freedom the competent courts should when imposing criminal sanctions on persons convicted of hate speech offences ensure strict respect for the principle of proportionality principle national law and practice in the area of hate speech should take due account of the role of the media in communicating information and ideas which expose analyse and explain specific instances of hate speech and the underlying phenomenon in general as well as the right of the public to receive such information and ideas to this end national law and practice should distinguish clearly between the responsibility of the author of expressions of hate speech on the one hand and any responsibility of the media and media professionals contributing to their dissemination as part of their mission to communicate information and ideas on matters of public interest on the other handb european commission against racism and intolerance ecri the relevant passages of ecris general policy recommendation no on combating hate speech adopted on december reads as follows the european commission against racism and intolerance ecritaking note of the differing ways in which hate speech has been defined and is understood at the national and international level as well as of the different forms that it can take considering that hate speech is to be understood for the purpose of the present general policy recommendation as the advocacy promotion or incitement in any form of the denigration hatred or vilification of a person or group of persons as well as any harassment insult negative stereotyping stigmatization or threat in respect of such a person or group of persons and the justification of all the preceding types of expression on the ground of race colour descent national or ethnic origin age disability language religion or belief sex gender gender identity sexual orientation and other personal characteristics or status recognising also that forms of expression that offend shock or disturb will not on that account alone amount to hate speech and that action against the use of hate speech should serve to protect individuals and groups of persons rather than particular beliefs ideologies or religions recognising that the use of hate speech can reflect or promote the unjustified assumption that the user is in some way superior to a person or a group of persons that is or are targeted by it recognising that the use of hate speech may be intended to incite or reasonably expected to have the effect of inciting others to commit acts of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those who are targeted by it and that this is an especially serious form of such speech recognising that the use of hate speech appears to be increasing especially through electronic forms of communication which magnify its impact but that its exact extent remains unclear because of the lack of systematic reporting and collection of data on its occurrence and that this needs to be remedied particularly through the provision of appropriate support for those targeted or affected by it aware that ignorance and insufficient media literacy as well as alienation discrimination indoctrination and marginalisation can be exploited to encourage the use of hate speech without the real character and consequences of such speech being fully appreciated stressing the importance of education in undermining the misconceptions and misinformation that form the basis of hate speech and of the need for such education to be directed in particular to the young recognising that an important means of tackling hate speech is through confronting and condemning it directly by counterspeech that clearly shows its destructive and unacceptable character recognising that politicians religious and community leaders and others in public life have a particularly important responsibility in this regard because of their capacity to exercise influence over a wide audience conscious of the particular contribution that all forms of media whether online or offline can play both in disseminating and combating hate speech recommends that the governments of member states take appropriate and effective action against the use in a public context of hate speech which is intended or can reasonably be expected to incite acts of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those targeted by it through the use of the criminal law provided that no other less restrictive measure would be effective and the right to freedom of expression and opinion is respected and accordinglya ensure that the offences are clearly defined and take due account of the need for a criminal sanction to be appliedb ensure that the scope of these offences is defined in a manner that permits their application to keep pace with technological developmentsc ensure that prosecutions for these offences are brought on a nondiscriminatory basis and are not used in order to suppress criticism of official policies political opposition or religious beliefsd ensure the effective participation of those targeted by hate speech in the relevant proceedingse provide penalties for these offences that take account both of the serious consequences of hate speech and the need for a proportionate responsef monitor the effectiveness of the investigation of complaints and the prosecution of offenders with a view to enhancing both of these in its explanatory memorandum ecri provides the following clarifications the recommendation further recognises that in some instances a particular feature of the use of hate speech is that it may be intended to incite or can reasonably be expected to have the effect of inciting others to commit acts of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those targeted by it as the definition above makes clear the element of incitement entails there being either a clear intention to bring about the commission of acts of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination or an imminent risk of such acts occurring as a consequence of the particular hate speech used intent to incite might be established where there is an unambiguous call by the person using hate speech for others to commit the relevant acts or it might be inferred from the strength of the language used and other relevant circumstances such as the previous conduct of the speaker however the existence of intent may not always be easy to demonstrate particularly where remarks are ostensibly concerned with supposed facts or coded language is being used european union law and caselaw of the court of

appeal had described the applicant as a calm respectful person who spent most of his time writing his memoirs the judge inferred that although it is unclear what the word memoirs entails it is quite possible that mr bidart might be tempted to publish his memoirs and make statements on the offences of which he was convicted nor did the judgment go into further detail on that point it explained however that during the adversarial proceedings mr bidart was reminded that the prosecution had requested the prohibition only of writings or statements connected with the offences of which he had been convicted that judgment was upheld by judgment of the paris court of appeal on august stating that the obligation in question merely prohibited commenting on or condoning the offences committed

72,the applicant company is a limited liability company and is the owner of the greek television channel alpha on january alpha broadcast a television show named jungle ζούγκλα in which three videos that had been filmed with a hidden camera were broadcast in the first video ac then a member of the hellenic parliament and chairman of the interparty committee on electronic gambling was shown entering a gambling arcade and playing on two machines the second video showed a meeting between ac and associates of the television host of jungle mt during which the first video was shown to ac the third video showed a meeting between ac and mt in the latters office on january the videos were shown again during a television show named yellow press κίτρινος τύπος presented by the same television host on may the national radio and television council εθνικό συμβούλιο ραδιοτηλεόρασης following an invitation to the applicant company held a hearing in which the applicant company was represented by its attorneys as can be seen from the minutes of the meeting the applicant companys attorneys acknowledged the use of hidden camera in the abovementioned incidents they argued that such use had been justified owing to ac being a public figure and that it had served the public interest as proven by the fact that the report had resulted in acs being dismissed from the parliamentary group of the political party for which he had been elected as parliamentary deputy in their view that had been the result not only of acs gambling activities but also of the fact that he had tried to negotiate with the applicant companys reporters to present the incident differently the applicant companys attorneys further argued that the use of a hidden camera had been exceptional and had been resorted to following the receipt of information that could not have been verified otherwise as nobody would have believed the journalists allegations if they had reported on the issue without broadcasting the images it can also be seen from the minutes that the members of the national radio and television council expressed their disagreement regarding the use of a hidden camera arguing that if anyone were able to use a hidden camera by claiming that there was an overriding public interest in doing so then all citizens especially if they were public figures would be exposed to the possibility of being subject to pressure and extortion they furthermore stressed that nobody would ever forbid journalists to report on a certain issue however the means used raised an issue as the use of hidden camera could be accepted only in respect of a national security issue or for the prevention of a serious crime or other similar situations they also noted that there were two separate issues in the instant case on the one hand the use of a hidden camera and on the other hand the entrapment of ac by its decision the national radio and television council ordered the applicant company to pay one hundred thousand euros eur for each of the two television shows during which the abovementioned videos were shown as well as to broadcast on three days in a row on its main news show the content of that decision the decision included a short description of the three videos a citation of the relevant legislation and the conclusion that the use of hidden camera in that case had not been in accordance with the relevant law it further stated that the sanctions had been imposed following an assessment of the gravity of the offence of the number of viewers of the two television shows of the size of the investment that had been made by the applicant company and the fact that the television channel had been repeatedly fined in the past for the same offence on june the decision of the national radio and television council was communicated to the minister of press and media who after examining its legality issued decision no e confirming its content on april the applicant company lodged an application for annulment αίτηση ακύρωσης against the decisions of the national radio and television council and the minister of press and media with the supreme administrative court συμβούλιο της επικρατείας on the grounds that the abovementioned decision had violated articles and of the greek constitution as well as article of the convention ac lodged a thirdparty intervention requesting from the supreme administrative court to dismiss the application for annulment on january the president of the supreme administrative court referred the case to the plenary supreme administrative court owing to its high importance the hearing before the plenary supreme administrative court took place on june by its judgment no published on april and finalised on may δημοσίευση και καθαρογραφή the supreme administrative court dismissed the application for annulment in its legal assessment the majority of the supreme administrative court firstly referred to the constitutional provisions providing the right to impart and receive information and then emphasised that this right is subject to limitations whose legitimate aim is the protection of the rights of others and the observance of the rule of law on condition that those limitations are proportionate it additionally referred to the courts caselaw in respect of article and on article with specific reference to caselaw concerning the protection of a persons image see von hannover v germany no echr vi schüssel v austria dec no february and sciacca v italy no echr i it continued by noting that under article of the constitution the state has the legal duty to exercise control over the radio and television in order to ensure respect for human values and that sanctions imposed by the national radio and television council served that purpose the supreme administrative court laid down the conditions under which it is legitimate to broadcast an image that has been filmed with the method of hidden camera by making a distinction between reporting on specific news whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret means and the broadcasting of the relevant secretly recorded image according to that reasoning recording by secret means an image which has as its main or only subject a specific person constitutes in principle a violation of that persons right to his own image which is protected by articles of the constitution and of the convention as a specific aspect of the right to respect for ones private life consequently the broadcasting on television of news whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret means can not in principle be considered as constituting the legitimate exercise of the right to impart information given that the disseminated news has been received under circumstances which constitute a violation of an individuals right to his own image nevertheless in certain cases it may be considered justified to broadcast such news on account of its contribution to a debate of general interest and taking into account the secretly recorded persons position or standing however even when broadcasting of the news is considered a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information this does not automatically render legitimate the broadcasting of the relevant secretly recorded images as that constitutes a much more intense έντονος limitation of the constitutionally protected right of that person to his own image than the simple transmission of news in the domestic courts view broadcasting of a secretly recorded image can only be justified if the legitimate for the reasons mentioned above broadcasting of such news is completely impossible or particularly difficult without broadcasting the image that was recorded by hidden means and which constitutes the source of the news by applying the abovementioned principles to the circumstances of the case the supreme administrative court dismissed the applicant companys argument that it had legitimately transmitted the news concerning ac in view of acs capacity as a public figure the domestic court stressed that from the text of the decision and from the minutes of the meeting of the national radio and television council it derived that the sanction was imposed to the applicant company solely and exclusively on account of the broadcast of the images that had been recorded by hidden means and not on account of the transmission of the news whose source had been the secretly recorded images as far as the broadcasting of the images was concerned the applicant company had not disputed that the images had been recorded by secret means and had not claimed that broadcasting of the news was absolutely impossible or extremely difficult without broadcasting the relevant images therefore the applicant companys allegation that it had broadcast the impugned images for reasons of journalistic interest and of public interest was dismissed on the basis of the abovementioned reasoning the supreme administrative court ruled that the decision of the national radio and television council had been fully reasoned and dismissed the applicant companys application for annulment a concurring more specific ειδικότερη opinion was joined to the majority opinion the seven judges considered that the recording of a person without his knowledge and the use of it for the broadcasting of news constituted a direct violation of that persons right to dignity as it reduces him to an instrument for others to achieving goals that are irrelevant to him given that pursuant to articles and of the constitution the protection of human dignity is absolute the broadcasting of such news is always forbidden irrespective of whether such a broadcast includes the image in question for those reasons the judges who supported this opinion considered that the application for annulment should be dismissed in addition there were two dissenting opinions according to the first one in view of the fact that the national radio and television council had considered that the broadcasting of news that had been recorded by secret means had constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information the same considerations should be extended to the broadcasting of the relevant image the reason for this was the special nature of television in comparison with the other media owing to which the broadcasting of the image went handinhand with broadcasting the news itself therefore the application for annulment should have been allowed given that the national radio and television councils decision had been based solely on the fact that the image of ac had been recorded by hidden means without considering whether broadcasting news whose source was the above images constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information lastly according to the other dissenting opinion no constitutional provision justified the absolute protection of an image as was held by the majority a persons right to his own image was susceptible to limitations that varied according to that persons position and the space in which the recording in question had taken place for individuals protection against the recording of their image without their consent was absolute irrespective of whether it took place in a public or private space unless the recording was not directed to them or the recording of the image took place with a view to the prevention of crimes in public space for public figures however protection was less absolute in particular public figures such as politicians were exposed to publicity and sometimes they even pursued it as a result there was a legitimate expectation on the part of the media and of the public to impart and receive information regarding their public activities for these persons there was an absolute protection of their image in their private space and in public spaces in which they shared private or family moments when however public figures were in public spaces but not under the conditions described above or acted in a way that was of interest to the public such as in cases in which they engaged in behaviour contrary to what their public role entailed or contrary to the image they projected towards the public then the right to receive and impart information could justify the recording of that person without his consent and the broadcasting of the relevant images by the media in this regard the dissenting judges argued that it would be inconceivable to equate radio with television as they did not operate on the same way therefore it would not be possible for a television show to simply announce the news without broadcasting the relevant images as would be the case on the radio in respect of legitimately recorded images when there is a balance between transparency and the right to receive information on the one hand and the protection of a persons image on the other hand the presumption should be that the recorded image could be broadcast without consent in view of the above the four judges considered that the application for annulment should be allowed taking into account especially the fact that ac was a public figure that the recording of his image had taken place in a public space that is to say in a gambling arcade and that the broadcasting of the relevant images had served the purpose of informing the public of behaviour on the part of a member of parliament that did not meet the requirements of his position therefore the television channels decision to broadcast the image as a part of the television shows which otherwise could be considered unfounded or even defamatory had not breached the proportionality principle ii relevant domestic lawa the constitution the relevant articles of the greek constitution provide as follows article a all persons have the right to information as specified by law restrictions on this right may be imposed by law
