0,in and lives in kragujevac at the relevant time he was a journalist and an editorinchief of svetlost a weekly news magazine based in the same town the applicant was represented by ms d rakićević a lawyer practising in kragujevac the government were represented by their agent ms z jadrijević mladar the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows the published articles on june svetlost published an article titled shame through silence ćutanjem do crvenila this piece written by the applicant in so far as relevant reads as follows kragujevac has reason to be ashamed towards the end of april the head of a municipal branch office in d firstly in the city centre and in front of the main post office building falsely introduced himself to a street vendor as a market inspector and then invited her into his car under the pretext that certain documents had to be copied thereafter he drove the girl away with him to karađorđeva street where he tried to rape her the girl was under age and of romani origin her resistance screams and crying ultimately thwarted the assailant the underaged girl was warned not to tell anyone what had happened and had to give her telephone number the next day when the head of the municipal branch office called her and arranged to meet her he was met by the police and arrested he was also detained for a period of fortyeight hours and then brought before an investigating judge the assailant was charged with false impersonation unlawful deprivation of liberty and attempted rape the proceedings have commenced and they shall of course have their conclusion the local police otherwise very prompt when it comes to informing the public even of much lesser offences simply kept silent about the incident the press also received no information from the investigating judge or the public prosecution service which has otherwise also been cooperative with respect to providing information concerning its activities this magazine indirectly found out about the horrific ordeal suffered by our underaged fellow citizen the police only provided us with information following receipt of our written request asking them to confirm or deny the details which we had learnt from others nongovernmental organisations focused on romani rights issues also stayed quiet the case of an underaged street vendor was probably not a priority for their rich donors the city administration likewise did nothing with respect to their own official why did they all remain silent uncomfortable questions will soon have to be answered by those in power did the police keep quiet about the attempted rape just because it concerned a romani girl did anyone and if so who from the city administration intervene in order to cover up the shameful incident was the idea to thereby buy time so as to make it possible for the head of the municipal branch office to strike a deal with the gypsies until they are paid off to withdraw their complaint of attempted rape lastly but most importantly whose interest is it in to protect the bully who is getting his salary paid from the municipal budget while in his free time attempting to rape his underaged fellow citizens for as long as these questions remain unanswered by those in power the city of kragujevac will be unable to remove its shame regarding this incident on the same date that is june svetlost published another article regarding the alleged incident titled the false inspector from d near kragujevac attempted to rape an underaged girl lažni inspektor iz d kod kragujevca pokušao da siluje maloletnicu this piece written by ms a a journalist employed with svetlost in so far as relevant reads as follows mr b the head of the municipal branch office in the village of d near kragujevac was brought before an investigating judge of the kragujevac court of first instance on april th of this year under suspicion of having committed the criminal offences of unlawful deprivation of liberty and performing illicit sexual acts on an underaged girl as confirmed to svetlost by the police the criminal complaint against mr b was lodged by an underaged girl who together with her mother had been selling on april th of this year and in front of the main post office building in kragujevac minor domestic supplies the police explored the allegations and after fortyeight hours of detention brought mr b before an investigating judge despite the incident having taken place in late april the police did not issue their usual press release until they received our request in this regard the criminal complaint lodged by the underaged girl states that on april th at around pm mr b introduced himself as a market inspector and told them that they could freely sell their merchandise in front of the post office building because he was in charge of that area one hour later he returned with his car in front of the post office building and invited the girl to approach the vehicle when the girl came near mr b told her to enter the car in order to sign a document and then locked the front passenger door and drove away with her from the scene he explained to the girl that certain documents had to be copied and started touching her leg according to the criminal complaint the girl then told the false inspector that she could not leave her mother but mr b asked her to calm down while parking his car in karađorđeva street he started touching her and kissing her on the neck and the girl started screaming but he then turned on the music loudly in his vehicle mr b tore the buttons off of her trousers and the clip off of her bra the girl punched against the car windows while mr b told her to calm down and that he would not touch her again he then drove her away to nikola pašić street proposed that they have a coffee together and told her not to tell anyone about what had happened one day later mr b called the girl on the phone her mother answered and an arrangement was made for the meeting to take place in front of the post office building there instead of being met by the girl mr b was met by the police and taken to the police station as noted above at the time of publication of the two articles the applicant was also the editorinchief of svetlost the first and second articles were published on pages and of the news magazine respectively the criminal proceedings following a preliminary criminal investigation on july mr b was charged by the kragujevac public prosecutors office osnovno javno tužilaštvo u kragujevcu in connection with the abovedescribed incident the charges alleged that he had committed the crimes of unlawful deprivation of liberty protivpravno lišenje slobode and illicit performance of sexual acts nedozvoljene polne radnje the kragujevac court of first instance osnovni sud u kragujevcu thereafter heard the defendant and the alleged victim as well as a number of witnesses it furthermore took into account the statements given and the documentation obtained in the course of the preliminary proceedings in the meantime on september the alleged victim provided the court with her own as well her mothers courtcertified statements of september wherein they both fully recanted their earlier testimony accusing mr b of the crimes in question on december the kragujevac court of first instance acquitted mr b of all charges on june following a remittal on appeal the same court again acquitted mr b of all charges on december this judgment was upheld by the kragujevac appeals court apelacioni sud u kragujevcu at second instance and it thereby became final the civil proceedings in july mr b lodged a civil defamation claim with the kragujevac high court viši sud u kragujevcu against the applicant ms a and svetlost regarding the two published articles on december this court ruled partly in favour of mr b and ordered the applicant and svetlost only not ms a to pay him jointly a total of serbian dinars rsd as well as statutory interest as of that date on account of the mental anguish suffered as a consequence of the breach of his honour and reputation plus rsd in litigation costs the court furthermore ordered the said two respondents to publish this judgment without comment or delay in their own news magazine the kragujevac high court explained as regards the first article and with specific reference to paragraph thereof that inter alia the applicant as its author had stated as fact that mr b had committed the crimes of unlawful deprivation of liberty false impersonation and attempted rape despite the fact that the criminal proceedings against the latter had still been pending thereby breaching his right to be presumed innocent furthermore the applicant had included an untrue statement of fact when he had reported that mr b had committed the crime of attempted rape even though he had known that the police had not pressed charges for that particular criminal offence see paragraph above with respect to the second article prepared by ms a and specifically as regards paragraphs and thereof the court rejected the plaintiffs claim noting that this piece had been written accurately based on the information provided by the police themselves see paragraph above lastly the court noted the existence of the statement of september see paragraph above but reiterated that it had no bearing on the present case since it had been given after the publication of the articles in question on april the kragujevac appeals court partly amended the judgment delivered at first instance in so doing it ordered the applicant ms a and svetlost to pay mr b jointly a total of rsd approximately euros eur at the time on account of the mental anguish suffered as a consequence of the breach of his honour and reputation as well as statutory interest from december plus rsd in litigation costs approximately eur at the time the obligation on the part of the respondents to publish the judgment was upheld in its reasoning which was essentially along the lines of that offered by the kragujevac high court the kragujevac appeals court nevertheless held inter alia that a the award of rsd had been excessive given the existing interest of the public to be informed of the incident in question albeit in a more appropriate manner b ms a had also incorrectly stated as fact in the title of her piece despite the more accurate text just below it that mr b had attempted to rape an underaged girl and c mr b could not be considered a public figure and as such someone who should have had to withstand more criticism since he had merely been employed as the head of a municipal branch office and had not been a local government official službenik u teritorijalnoj jedinici lokalne samouprave the above rulings relied on inter alia some of the relevant provisions of the obligations act and the public information act summarised in paragraphs below the proceedings before the constitutional court on may the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal ustavnu žalbu against the kragujevac appeals courts judgment of april on december the constitutional court ustavni sud dismissed the appeal it noted inter alia that it was unlawful to divulge information concerning an ongoing criminal case even if this information was accurate or to breach ones right to be presumed innocent in any event an appropriate balance had to be struck between the freedom of expression on the one hand and the protection of the reputation of the person concerned on the other and the civil courts in the case at hand had done so properly the applicant was served with the constitutional courts decision on february the enforcement proceedings on february mr b lodged an enforcement request predlog za izvršenje with the kragujevac court of first instance as regards the civil judgments of december and april see paragraphs and above on february the kragujevac court of first instance issued the enforcement order rešenje o izvršenju on august the bailiff izvršitelj ordered the applicant to pay within three days the sums in question and noted inter alia that should he fail to comply his entire property would be subject to enforcement izvršenje na celokupnoj imovini according to the information provided by the applicant since may he had been unemployed and lacking any movable assets of relevance to the enforcement procedure this was also why the civil judgments in question had not yet been enforced the applicant however stated that he did own a flat in which he had been living with his family and that mr b could yet seek enforcement on this property the government confirmed that as of april the civil judgments at issue remained unenforced other relevant facts in his statement given to the kragujevac high court on october as part of the civil defamation proceedings mr b recounted that after the publication of the articles in question he had called the applicant and had asked him why such pieces had been published at all the applicant in response had offered him the opportunity to deny the allegations in the newsmagazines next issue but mr b had refused this offer because he had not wanted to debate the matter through the media lastly mr b had informed the applicant that he would instead be bringing legal proceedings in this regard on june mr b visited a neuropsychiatrist allegedly as a consequence of the distress which he had suffered due to the publication of the articles on the same date he was also provided with a certificate attesting that he was temporarily incapable of working in april the average gross and net monthly salaries in kragujevac were rsd and rsd approximately eur and eur respectively relevant legal framework and jurisprudence

skupština heads of local branch offices shall be municipal employees appointed either by the municipal assemblies themselves or by other bodies authorised to do so by the municipal assemblies the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that he had suffered a breach of his freedom of expression in particular he maintained i that the printed articles in question had raised serious issues to do with the alleged sexual abuse of an underaged romani girl and ii that he had ultimately ended up being punished for the articles publication by losing a civil defamation case and being ordered to pay compensation plus costs to mr b article of the convention in so far as relevant reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to impart information and ideas without interference by public authority the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the court notes that the application is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any of the other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merits the parties submissionsa the applicant the applicant reaffirmed his complaints he added that the situation as regards the protection of minority groups in serbia had been poor particularly with respect to the roma who had been among the most vulnerable groups in the country moreover even though mr b had not been formally charged with false impersonation or attempted rape given what had in fact happened during the incident and the similarities between and interconnectedness of the offences in question it had not been wrong generally speaking to describe his actions as such in any event while svetlost had been fully entitled to present negative value judgments regarding an incident which had clearly been of great public interest there had never been any intent to gratuitously harm mr b as illustrated by the latters own statement given in court on october see paragraph above the applicant furthermore submitted that in the present case everything had been done in order to cover up the incident and secure impunity for the perpetrator simply because the victim herself had been of romani origin the criminal proceedings against mr b had thus ultimately collapsed due to the pressure which had been brought to bear on the victim and her mother which in turn had had the consequence of them recanting their allegations in respect of mr b see paragraph above lastly the applicant argued that in the serbian legal system the position of a head of a municipal branch office was a very important public function see paragraph above and maintained that the compensation and costs which had been awarded against him had never been enforced only because he had neither had the property nor the income to cover those amounts see paragraph aboveb the government the government endorsed the reasoning of the civil courts see paragraphs and above as well as the reasons which had been offered by the constitutional court see paragraph above and maintained that there had been no violation of article in the present case in particular the interference with the applicants freedom of expression had been in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation of others see paragraph above furthermore the civil courts had not awarded compensation to mr b for any negative value judgments expressed in the articles but for the publication of untrue statements of fact which had ended up seriously harming his wellbeing and affecting his reputation see paragraph above according to the government the media in general had to show a greater degree of respect for the presumption of innocence as well as attention and seriousness when reporting on cases involving sexual violence given the severity of the social condemnation of such offences locally the second article moreover had repeatedly mentioned mr b by his name and the initial of his surname which had made his identification easy for anyone interested also mr b could not be considered as a public official and hence someone who would have had to endure stronger and more provocative criticism since he had merely been an employee of the city of kragujevac and the head of a municipal branch office at the material time see paragraphs above in any event the two articles had had nothing to do with the official performance of his duties finally the government argued that the amount of compensation which had been awarded to mr b had not been disproportionate given that it had amounted to less than one average gross monthly salary in kragujevac at the relevant time see paragraph above the courts assessmenta existence of an interference it is not disputed between the parties that the final civil judgment rendered against the applicant as a journalist and an editorinchief by the kragujevac appeals court on april amounted to an interference by a public authority with his right to freedom of expression see paragraph above see also mutatis mutandis lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc nos and and echr iv orban and others v france no january with further references and gutiérrez suárez v spain no and june as regards the situation of authors as well as publishers publication directors and editors responsible for their publications such an interference will infringe the convention unless it satisfies the requirements of paragraph of article it must therefore be determined whether it was prescribed by law pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in that paragraph and was necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve those aimsb whether the interference was prescribed by law the court notes that the legal bases for the adoption of the final civil judgement in question were inter alia the relevant provisions of the public information act and the obligations act see paragraphs and above the court holds that these provisions were both adequately accessible and foreseeable that is to say that they were formulated with sufficient precision to enable an individual if need be with appropriate advice to regulate his or her conduct see for example and among many other authorities the sunday times v the united kingdom no april series a no and karácsony and others v hungary gc nos and may see also in the serbian context tešić v serbia nos and february the court therefore concludes that the interference at issue was prescribed by law within the meaning of article of the conventionc whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim in agreement with the position of the domestic courts the government argued that the interference in question had pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation or rights of others the court finds no reason to hold otherwise and accepts therefore that the interference with the applicants freedom of expression pursued one of the legitimate aims envisaged under article of the conventiond necessary in a democratic societyi general principles the court refers to the general principles for assessing the necessity of an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression as set out in morice v france gc no echr bédat v switzerland gc no march and medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june the court has also held in numerous cases that a lack of relevant and sufficient reasoning on the part of the national courts or a failure to consider the applicable standards in assessing the interference in question will entail a violation of article see among many other authorities scharsach and news verlagsgesellschaft v austria no echr xi uj v hungary no and july and mariya alekhina and others v russia no july it should furthermore be reiterated that the right to protection of reputation is a right which is guaranteed under article of the convention as part of the right to respect for private life see for instance denisov v ukraine gc no september in order for article to come into play an attack on a persons reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be carried out in a manner causing prejudice to the personal enjoyment of ones right to respect for his or her private life see axel springer ag v germany gc no february medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above and beizaras and levickas v lithuania no january in instances where in accordance with the criteria set out above the interests of the protection of the reputation or rights of others bring article into play the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance when protecting the two values guaranteed by the convention namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above the general principles applicable to the balancing of these rights were first set out in von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr and axel springer ag cited above then restated in more detail in couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no echr extracts and more recently summarised in medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above lastly the court has held that the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity and scope of any interference in the freedom of expression protected by article of the convention where the national authorities have weighed up the interests at stake in compliance with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw strong reasons are required if it is to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see bédat cited above with further references the relevant criteria when it comes to the balancing exercise between the rights protected under article and article of the convention include a the contribution made by the article in question to a debate of public interest b how well known is the person concerned and what is the subject of the report c the conduct of the person concerned prior to the publication of the article d the method of obtaining the information and its veracity e the content form and consequences of the publication and f the severity of the sanction imposed see for example axel springer ag cited above and milisavljević v serbia no april of course some of the above criteria may have more or less relevance given the particular circumstances of a given case see satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june and other relevant criteria may also be taken into account depending on the situation see axel springer se and rtl television gmb h v germany no september ii application of these principles to the present case in assessing the relevant statements contained in the two published articles and the reasons given in the domestic civil courts judgments to justify the interference with the applicants freedom of expression the court finds the following issues of particular relevance having regard to the criteria identified in paragraphs above whether the statements in question made a contribution to a debate of public interest whether mr b can be considered a public figure the method of obtaining information on the part of the applicant and his publication as well as the content form and veracity of the information contained in the articles and lastly the consequences of the publication of the articles in respect of mr b and the severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant himselfα whether the articles made a contribution to a debate of public interest the public interest ordinarily relates to matters which affect the public to such an extent that it may legitimately take an interest in them which attract its attention or which concern it to a significant degree especially in that they affect the wellbeing of citizens or the life of the community see among others satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above the court has furthermore recognised the existence of such an interest for example when the publication in question concerned information on criminal proceedings in general see dupuis and others v france no june and july and sarl libération v france no echr extracts or information regarding a specific criminal case see white v sweden no september and egeland and hanseid v norway no april with this in mind the court considers that the two published articles in the present case clearly concerned an incident of public interest referring as they did to an alleged sexual assault on an underaged romani girl and the very serious charges subsequently brought against mr b in this connectionβ whether mr b can be considered a public figure the court reiterates that a distinction has to be made between private individuals and persons acting in a public context as political or public figures accordingly whilst a private individual unknown to the public may claim particular protection of his or her right to private life the same is not true of public figures see minelli v switzerland dec no june petrenco v moldova no march and milisavljević cited above in respect of whom the limits of critical comment are wider as they are inevitably and knowingly exposed to public scrutiny and must therefore display a particularly high degree of tolerance see kuliś v poland no march ayhan erdoğan v turkey no january and milisavljević cited above as regards state bodies and civil servants the court has held that when acting in an official capacity they too are in some circumstances subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals see for example lombardo and others v malta no april and romanenko and others v russia no october however it can not be said that civil servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent to which politicians do and should therefore be treated on an equal footing with the latter when it comes to the criticism of their actions see mutatis mutandis janowski v poland gc no echr i see also nikula v finland no echr ii and mariapori v finland no july in view of the above and quite apart from the parties different views on whether mr b should be deemed a public figure within the meaning of the courts case law under article of the convention the court notes that the published articles in question concerned an incident in which mr b had been alleged to have committed a sexual assault and not claims to the effect that he had somehow inappropriately or unlawfully carried out any of his official duties in his capacity as a civil servant ie as head of a municipal branch office in these specific circumstances it can not be said that in the context of seeking redress for the violation of his reputation mr b should have shown a greater degree of tolerance than a private individual in a similar situationγ the method of obtaining information and the content form and veracity of the information contained in the articles the court would stress that in the context of freedom of expression it draws a distinction between statements of fact and value judgments the existence of facts can be demonstrated whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article however where a statement amounts to a value judgment the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement if there is not that value judgment may prove excessive in order to distinguish between a factual allegation and a value judgment it is necessary to take account of the circumstances of the case and the general tone of the remarks bearing in mind that assertions about matters of public interest may on that basis constitute value judgments rather than statements of fact see for instance morice cited above with further references regard must also be had in the courts view to the special role of the judiciary in society in particular it is inconceivable that there should be no prior or contemporaneous discussion of the subject matter of trials be it in specialised journals in the general press or amongst the public at large not only do the media have the task of imparting such information and ideas the public also has a right to receive them however consideration must be given to everyones right to a fair hearing as secured under article of the convention which in criminal matters includes the right to an impartial tribunal and the right to the presumption of innocence as the court has repeatedly emphasised this must be borne in mind by journalists when commenting on pending criminal proceedings since the limits of permissible comment may not extend to statements which are likely to prejudice whether intentionally or not the chances of a person receiving a fair trial or to undermine the confidence of the public in the role of the courts in the administration of criminal justice see bédat cited above with further references being mindful of the above and as regards the present case the court notes that the applicant and the news magazine were ultimately informed of the alleged incident and the related procedural developments by the police themselves see paragraphs and above furthermore the civil courts properly established that the first article had stated as fact that mr b had committed a number of crimes despite it having been known that the criminal proceedings against him were still pending thereby ignoring his right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty see for example axel springer se and rtl television gmb h cited above bédat cited above and ruokanen and others v finland no and april also it contained an incorrect statement of fact in so far as it reported that mr b had committed the crime of attempted rape even though the news magazine itself was in possession of information that the police had not even pressed charges against him for this particular offence see paragraphs and above concerning both articles the kragujevac appeals court also quite rightly in the courts view added that while there had been an interest on the part of the public to be informed of the alleged incident this had to be done in an appropriate manner and moreover as regards the second article only that despite the more accurate text just below it the articles title had stated that mr b had in fact attempted to rape an underaged girl see paragraph above also compare to and contrast with for example tešić cited above and in that order where the applicant did not explicitly disregard the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty but stated merely that her former lawyer had deliberately failed to represent her properly in a pending civil suit as confirmed by a subsequent police investigation furthermore the applicants allegations in the present case involving sexual abuse as they did were of a much more serious and sensitive nature it follows therefore that as suggested by the government in their observations the domestic civil courts had not ruled against the applicant based on any negative value judgments expressed in the articles but because of the publication of inaccurate statements of fact see mutatis mutandis egill einarsson v iceland no ab initio november where the court held inter alia that the objective and factual nature of the term rapist when viewed on its face did not justify the conclusion that the statement in question constituted a value judgment rather than a statement of fact despite then going into an analysis even assuming that the opposite were the case moreover while restricting an applicants right to criticise the actions of public powers by imposing an obligation to accurately respect the legal definition of a given crime might generally speaking disproportionally undermine his or her right to freedom of expression in the specific circumstances of the present case the applicant as indeed any average citizen too should have been able to make a common sense distinction between such sensitive yet very different phrases as attempted to rape stated as fact on the one hand and for example suspected of having attempted to rape on the other compare and contrast to toranzo gomez v spain no november lastly the second article mentioned mr b by his name and the initial of his surname which made his identification easy for persons locally it being common knowledge that mr b was the head of a specific municipal branch office near kragujevac at the material time see paragraph aboveδ the consequences of the publication of the two articles in respect of mr b and the severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant as already noted above the right to protection of reputation is a right which is guaranteed under article of the convention as part of the right to respect for private life see paragraphs and above furthermore the nature and severity of the sanction imposed is a matter of particular importance in assessing the proportionality of the interference under article see paragraph above the amount of any compensation awarded must likewise bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the moral injury suffered by the plaintiff in question see tolstoy miloslavsky v the united kingdom july series a no b see also tešić cited above in view of the foregoing and given the nature of the criminal charges brought against mr b as well as its own conclusions set out in paragraph above the court considers that the consequences of the publication of the articles in question were clearly sufficiently serious so as to attract the protection of article in respect of mr bs reputation see paragraphs and above at the same time however the final civil court judgment rendered against the applicant ordering him inter alia to pay an rsd equivalent of approximately eur for the mental anguish suffered and the costs incurred plus statutory interest can not be deemed as severe in itself particularly given that the amounts awarded to mr b were never enforced against the applicant see paragraphs and above also compare and contrast to tešić cited above and ε conclusion in the light of the above considerations the court is of the opinion that the civil courts struck a fair balance between the applicants freedom of expression on the one hand and mr bs interest in the protection of his reputation on the other and that the reasons given in their judgments in this context were both relevant and sufficient furthermore the civil proceedings against the applicant were themselves concluded before the conclusion of the criminal case brought against mr b which was why the latter could not have been of any relevance for the outcome of former see paragraphs and above see also paragraphs and in fine above the alleged incident giving rise to the impugned articles involved allegations of a particularly serious and sensitive nature in spite of the essential role of the press in a democratic society however paragraph of article does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern see for example bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii and monnat v switzerland no echr x indeed the protection afforded by article of the convention to journalists as well as to editors by implication is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism

1,the applicant was born in and lives in weinheim he is a campaigner against abortion and operates an antiabortion website on november and december the applicant distributed leaflets in the immediate vicinity of the medical practice of dr s the leaflets contained inter alia the following text on the front page did you know that dr s full name and address performs abortions that are unlawful according to the caselaw of the federal constitutional court wussten sie schon dass dr s abtreibungen durchführt die nach der rechtsprechung des bundesverfassungsgerichts rechtswidrig sind underneath the following was in smaller type according to international criminal law aggravated murder is the intentional bringingtodeath of an innocent human being sinngemӓβ aus den internationalen strafgesetzen mord ist das vorsӓtzliche zu tode bringen eines unschuldigen menschen the back side of the folded leaflet contained the following text the aggravated murder of human beings in auschwitz was unlawful but the morally degraded ns state allowed the aggravated murder of innocent people and did not make it subject to criminal liability die ermordung der menschen in auschwitz war rechtswidrig aber der moralisch verkommene nsstaat hatte den mord an den unschuldigen menschen erlaubt und nicht unter strafe gestellt the applicant further quoted parts of the federal constitutional courts leading judgment of may bverf ge see paragraph below with regard to abortion and a statement by christoph wilhelm hufeland the personal physician of goethe and schiller he also cited section of the conflicts in pregnancy act see paragraph below and asked readers to make use of their influence on those performing and assisting in abortions by a letter of december dr s requested that the applicant sign a declaration to cease and desist the applicant refused and published the following statement on his website if dr s full name by carrying out abortions publicly shows that he agrees with abortions then he should stand by his opinion instead dr s considers the leaflet campaign to be slander threatens an interim injunction and has already given his lawyer a mandate to lodge a criminal complaint for defamationslander we ask ourselves is dr s unprincipled and characterless wenn dr s mit der durchführung von abtreibungen öffentlich bekundet dass er für abtreibungen ist dann sollte er auch dazu stehen stattdessen sieht dr s in der flugblatt verteilaktion eine rufmordkampagne droht mit einer einstweiligen verfügung und hat bereits seinem rechtsanwalt die vollmacht gegeben eine strafanzeige wegen beleidigung verleumdung zu erwirken wir fragen uns ist dr s stand und charakterlos subsequently dr s applied to the karlsruhe regional court for a civil injunction ordering the applicant not to claim on the internet that the plaintiff performed unlawful abortions and not to disseminate leaflets containing his name and the assertion that unlawful abortions were performed in his medical practice he also lodged a claim for nonpecuniary damages in the amount of euros eur and for pretrial legal fees on september the date of the oral hearing before the karlsruhe regional court the applicant distributed a second leaflet directly in front of dr ss practice among other places the applicant deposited this second leaflet in which dr s was not mentioned by name into letterboxes in the immediate vicinity of the latters practice the following sentence was on the front side of the leaflet near you unlawful abortions and you are silent about the aggravated murder of our children in ihrer nähe rechtswidrige abtreibungen und sie schweigen zum mord an unseren kindern emphases in original the back of the folded leaflet contained the following text these prenatal infanticides have meanwhile taken on proportions that bring to mind a new holocaust diese vorgeburtlichen kindstötungen haben mittlerweile ausmaße angenommen welche an einen neuen holocaust erinnern emphases in original farther down the leaflet read im simply unable to understand that medical personnel and doctors who are supposed to help and save lives stoop to take part in aggravated murder noch weniger kann ich verstehen dass mediziner und ärzte welche helfen und leben retten sollen sich fürs morden hergeben on november the karlsruhe regional court granted the requested injunction and ordered the applicant to desist from asserting publicly both in writing and orally on the internet as well as on leaflets that the plaintiff performed unlawful abortions in his medical practice in addition the regional court awarded compensation for the pecuniary damage requested by the plaintiff eur and dismissed the claim in respect of nonpecuniary damage the court held that the applicants statements were protected by freedom of expression and contributed to a public debate moreover they had to be classified as statements of fact and as such the information that abortions were unlawful was in line with the judgment of the constitutional court and not incorrect however when read in conjunction with the whole leaflet the statements had a pillory effect and amounted to a serious interference with dr ss personality rights which was not justified by the applicants freedom of expression the court came to this conclusion based on the facts that the applicant had singled out dr s by mentioning him by name and distributing the leaflets in the vicinity of his practice that he had quoted the federal constitutional courts judgment only in parts and had omitted the parts that stated that doctors had not been subject to criminal liability that he had implied by defining aggravated murder that dr s had committed this criminal offence and that he had associated dr s with the holocaust nonetheless in regard to nonpecuniary damage the court concluded that even though the attacks on dr ss reputation had been grave enough to justify the injunction they had not been sufficiently serious to justify nonpecuniary damage the applicant and dr s appealed against the regional courts decision additionally dr s expanded his action to include the second leaflet see paragraph above which subsequently became the subject matter of the judgment of the karlsruhe court of appeal on february the karlsruhe court of appeal confirmed the reasoning of the regional court and in essence dismissed both appeals however it partly modified the regional courts judgment concerning the precise wording of the requested injunction it ordered the applicant to desist from asserting in public that dr s performed unlawful abortions in his medical practice and asserting in direct connection to this that aggravated murder is the intentional bringingtodeath of an innocent human being the court of appeal further ordered the applicant to desist from asserting that dr s performed unlawful abortions causing infanticide at the outset it emphasised that the applicants view that abortions should be subject to criminal liability and were not compatible with higherranking law fell within the applicants freedom of expression however the court also noted that the very wording of the applicants statements showed that he labelled abortions as performed by the plaintiff aggravated murder which could not be tolerated neither if the statements were considered statements of fact nor if considered value judgments in the courts view the applicant had created an unacceptable pillory effect by singling out the plaintiff who had not given the applicant any reason to do so in that regard the court noted that dr s had not been involved in the public debate about abortions in any way in regard to the second leaflet the court of appeal held that even though dr s had not been mentioned by name it had referred to him as it had been distributed in front of his medical practice and deposited in letterboxes in the vicinity similarly to the first leaflet a not negligible part of the readers would have understood from the leaflet that dr ss professional activities had constituted aggravated murder however even if understood in a nonlegal sense the leaflet had made it understood that the applicant had conducted illegal and punishable abortions since the applicant had not clarified that he had only been criticising abortions which were according to the caselaw of the federal constitutional court see paragraph below unlawful but not subject to criminal liability he had exceeded the limits of justifiable criticism as to the claim for damages the court of appeal upheld the firstinstance judgment it also did not grant leave to appeal on points of law on may the federal court of justice refused a request by the applicant for legal aid for his complaint against the denial of leave to appeal on points of law on the grounds that the applicants intended appeal on points of law lacked sufficient prospect of success on july the federal constitutional court refused to admit a complaint lodged by the applicant for adjudication for being inadmissible without providing reasons no bv r ii relevant domestic law and practice the relevant domestic law and practice have been set out in the courts judgment in the case annen no no september the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the injunction ordering him to desist from asserting that dr s performed unlawful abortions in his medical practice had violated his freedom of expression as provided in article of the convention which reads in so far as relevant as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or rights of others a admissibility the court notes that this complaint is neither inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remedies see annen v germany no november nor manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions the applicant argued that the court of appeals desist order had interfered with his freedom of expression without being justified by the protection of the personality rights of dr s he submitted that his leaflets had contributed to a public debate and had not personally attacked dr s but had criticised the legal situation in germany under which abortions performed by a doctor within twelve weeks of conception and following obligatory counselling were considered to be unlawful but were exempt from criminal liability the use of the term aggravated murder did not have to be understood as a legal qualification of dr ss professional activities but as critique of the killing of unborn children the applicant further submitted that abortions could be considered aggravated murder in a legal sense since the killing of defenseless unborn babies could be seen as malicious within the meaning of article of the criminal code in any case in the light of his contribution to a public debate of great importance possible interferences with doctors personality rights had to be justified the government submitted that the injunction by the court of appeal had not violated the applicants freedom of expression the courts had carefully weighed the applicants freedom of expression against the rights of dr s arising from article of the convention they acknowledged that the applicant had made his statement in the context of the public debate about abortion within the scope of its margin of appreciation the domestic courts had come to the compelling conclusion that the statements in the leaflets distributed by the applicant had constituted such a serious violation of dr ss personality rights as to justify a restriction on the applicants freedom of expression the government further submitted that the domestic courts had carried out an extensive analysis of the leaflets discussed various conceivable possibilities of interpretation and come to the convincing conclusion that dr s had been pilloried as a supposed lawbreaker based on this conclusion it had issued an injunction which had been limited to the claim that dr s had performed unlawful abortions and had put these within the same context as aggravated murder andor expressly characterising them as infanticide the applicant had not been prohibited from taking a public and very clear stance against abortion and the court of appeal had even emphasised the applicants right protected by freedom of expression to characterise abortion as an injustice moreover he had also not been prohibited per se from personally and sharply criticising abortion providers such as dr s for their activities the courts assessment at the outset the court considers and this is not in dispute between the parties that the injunction interfered with the applicants freedom of expression had a legal basis and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and reputation of dr s it therefore remains to be determined whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society and whether the balancing exercise undertaken by the domestic courts was in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the fundamental principles concerning the question of whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the courts caselaw and have recently been summarised as follows see delfi as v estonia gc no june with further referencesi freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society as set forth in article this freedom is subject to exceptions which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article iii the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts the court further reiterates that the right to protection of reputation is protected by article of the convention as part of the right to respect for private life see chauvy and others v france no echr vi pfeifer v austria no november and polanco torres and movilla polanco v spain no september in order for article to come into play however an attack on a persons reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be made in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see a v norway no april axel springer ag v germany gc no february and delfi as cited above in cases that concerned allegations of criminal conduct the court also took into account that under article of the convention individuals have a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty see among other authorities worm v austria august reports of judgments and decisions v and du roy and malaurie v france no echr x when examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interests of the protection of the reputation or rights of others the court may be required to ascertain whether the domestic authorities have struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see hachette filipacchi associés v france no june mgn limited v the united kingdom no january axel springer ag cited above and delfi as cited above although opinions may differ on the outcome of a judgment where a balancing exercise was undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see lillo stenberg and sæther v norway no january with references to axel springer ag cited above and von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr turning to the circumstances of the present case the court observes that while the regional court considered the statements to be statements of fact the court of appeal left this question open as in both cases the applicants statements had not been justified it considered that while strictly speaking calling abortions unlawful was correct the statement read in conjunction with the rest of leaflet could be understood as alleging that dr ss professional activities constituted aggravated murder the court reiterates that it has held in a previous decision see annen v germany dec nos march that german law under article a of the criminal code draws a fine line between abortions which are considered to be unlawful but exempt from criminal liability and those abortions which are considered as justified and thus lawful it follows that the applicants statement that the physician performed among others unlawful abortions was correct from a strictly judicial point of view however having regard to the fact that the applicant primarily addressed his statement to laypersons the court accepts that the domestic courts also took into account the point of view of a reasonable man with ordinary susceptibility who would assume that the unlawful abortions were forbidden in a stricter sense and subject to criminal liability the court considers that the present case is comparable to the case of annen v germany dec cited above as the leaflets provided no further explanation regarding the fact that doctors providing abortions were exempt from criminal liability under article a of the criminal code in contrast the applicant even reinforced the assumption that the abortions provided by dr s were subject to criminal liability by providing his own definition of aggravated murder in international law in the first leaflet and calling abortions infanticide in the second leaflet the court therefore agrees with the domestic courts that when taking into account the leaflets as a whole they could be understood as alleging that dr ss professional activities constituted aggravated murder this conclusion is not called into question by the courts judgment in the case of annen cited above since in that case the leaflet in question had provided sufficiently clear further explanation according to which the abortions were not subject to criminal liability the court would further reiterate that while the existence of facts can be demonstrated the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof however even where a statement amounts to a value judgment there must be a sufficient factual basis to support it failing which it will be excessive see jerusalem v austria no echr ii the court notes that the applicant has neither in the domestic proceedings nor before the court submitted any indication that dr s committed aggravated murder or that the abortions performed by him were subject to criminal liability moreover in so far as the applicant argued before the court that abortions could be considered aggravated murder within the meaning of article of the criminal code the court notes that there is no evidence for that argument in domestic law or domestic caselaw in contrast article of the criminal code clearly defines abortions that are not exempted from criminal liability under article a of the criminal code in sum the court finds that even assuming that the applicants statements were to be considered value judgments there was not a sufficient factual basis for calling abortions as performed by dr s murder in that regard the court also notes that these accusations were not only very serious something reflected in the fact that a conviction for aggravated murder would carry a life sentence but might also incite to hatred and aggression in regard to the seriousness of the sanction imposed on the applicant the court observes that he was not criminally convicted for slander or ordered to pay damages contrast pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi in addition the injunction was limited in scope and only prevented the applicant from stating that dr s was performing unlawful abortions and putting these within the same context as aggravated murder andor expressly characterising them as infanticide in that regard the court notes that the applicant was not per se prohibited from campaigning against abortions or criticising doctors that conducted abortions lastly the court notes that the domestic courts carried out a detailed analysis of the leaflets and discussed various possibilities of interpreting the statements therein it is therefore satisfied that the legal protection received by the applicant at the domestic level was compatible with the procedural requirements of article of the convention in these circumstances the court concludes that the injunction was not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued namely the protection of the rights and reputation of dr s and that the reasons given by the domestic courts were relevant and sufficient the interference with the applicants exercise of his right to freedom of expression could therefore reasonably be regarded by the domestic courts as necessary in a democratic society there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the complaint concerning article of the convention admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rules of court claudia

2,the applicant company is a public limited company aktsiaselts registered in estonia a background of the case the applicant company is the owner of delfi an internet news portal that publishes up to news articles a day delfi is one of the largest news portals on the internet in estonia it publishes news in estonian and russian in estonia and also operates in latvia and lithuania at the material time at the end of the body of the news articles there were the words add your comment and fields for comments the commenters name and his or her email address optional below these fields there were buttons publish the comment and read comments the part for reading comments left by others was a separate area which could be accessed by clicking on the read comments button the comments were uploaded automatically and were as such not edited or moderated by the applicant company the articles received about readers comments daily the majority posted under pseudonyms nevertheless there was a system of notifyandtakedown in place any reader could mark a comment as leim an estonian word for an insulting or mocking message or a message inciting hatred on the internet and the comment was removed expeditiously furthermore there was a system of automatic deletion of comments that included certain stems of obscene words in addition a victim of a defamatory comment could directly notify the applicant company in which case the comment was removed immediately the applicant company had made efforts to advise users that the comments were not its opinion and that the authors of comments were responsible for their content on delfis internet site there were rules of comment which included the following the delfi message board is a technical medium allowing users to publish comments delfi does not edit comments an author of a comment is liable for hisher comment it is worth noting that there have been cases in the estonian courts where authors have been punished for the contents of a comment delfi prohibits comments the content of which does not comply with good practice these are comments that contain threats contain insults incite hostility and violence incite illegal activities contain obscene expressions and vulgarities delfi has the right to remove such comments and restrict their authors access to the writing of comments the functioning of the noticeandtakedown system was also explained in the text the government submitted that in estonia delfi had a notorious history of publishing defaming and degrading comments thus on september the weekly newspaper eesti ekspress had published a public letter from the editorial board to the minister of justice the chief public prosecutor and the chancellor of justice in which concern was expressed about incessant taunting of people on public websites in estonia delfi was named as a source of brutal and arrogant mockery b article and comments published on the internet news portal on january the applicant company published an article on the delfi portal under the heading slk destroyed planned ice road ice roads are public roads over the frozen sea which are open between the estonian mainland and some islands in winter the abbreviation slk stands for as saaremaa laevakompanii saaremaa shipping company a public limited company slk provides a public ferry transport service between the mainland and some islands l was a member of the supervisory board of slk and the companys sole or majority shareholder at the material time on and january the article attracted comments about twenty of them contained personal threats and offensive language directed against l on march ls lawyers requested the applicant company to remove the offensive comments and claimed kroons eek approximately euros eur

i also shit onto his head on the same day the offensive comments were removed by the applicant company on march the applicant company responded to the request from ls lawyers it informed l that the comments had been removed under the noticeandtakedown obligation and refused the claim for damages c civil proceedings against the applicant company on april l brought a civil suit with the harju county court against the applicant company at the hearing of may the representatives of the applicant company submitted inter alia that in cases like the bronze night public disorders related to the relocation of the bronze soldier monument in april delfi had removed comments per day also on its own initiative by a judgment of june ls claim was dismissed the county court found that the applicant companys responsibility was excluded under the information society services act infoühiskonna teenuse seadus which was based on the directive on electronic commerce directive ec of the european parliament and of the council of june on certain legal aspects of information society services in particular electronic commerce in the internal market the court considered that the comment environment in the applicant companys news portal was to be distinguished from the portals journalistic area the administration of the former by the applicant company was essentially of a mechanical and passive nature the applicant company could not be considered the publisher of the comments nor did it have any obligation to monitor them on october the tallinn court of appeal allowed ls appeal it considered that the county court had erred in finding that the applicant companys responsibility was excluded under the information society services act the county courts judgment was quashed and the case referred back to the firstinstance court for new consideration on january the supreme court declined to hear the applicant companys appeal on june the harju county court having reexamined the case found for l in accordance with the court of appeals instructions it relied on the obligations act võlaõigusseadus and deemed the information society services act inapplicable it observed that the applicant company had placed a note on its internet site that comments were not edited that it was prohibited to post comments that were contrary to good practice and that the applicant company reserved to itself the right to remove such comments a system was put in place whereby users could notify the applicant company of any inappropriate comments however the county court considered that this was insufficient and did not allow adequate protection for the personality rights of others the court found that the applicant company itself was to be considered the publisher of the comments and it could not avoid responsibility by publishing a disclaimer that it was not liable for the content of the comments the county court found that the news article itself published in the delfi news portal was a balanced one a number of comments however were vulgar in form they were humiliating and defamatory and impaired ls honour dignity and reputation the comments went beyond justified criticism and amounted to simple insults the court concluded that freedom of expression did not extend to protection of the comments concerned and that ls personality rights had been violated l was awarded eek eur in nonpecuniary damages on december the tallinn court of appeal upheld the county courts judgment it emphasised that the applicant company had not been required to exercise preliminary control over comments posted on its news portal however having chosen not to do so it should have created some other effective system which would have ensured rapid removal of unlawful comments from the portal the court of appeal considered that the measures taken by the applicant company were insufficient and that it was contrary to the principle of good faith to place the burden of monitoring the comments on their potential victims the court of appeal rejected the applicant companys argument that its responsibility was excluded on the basis of the information society services act it noted that the applicant company was not a technical intermediary in respect of the comments and that its activity was not of a merely technical automatic and passive nature instead it invited users to add comments thus the applicant company was a provider of content services rather than of technical services on june the supreme court dismissed the applicant companys appeal it upheld the court of appeals judgment in substance but partly modified its reasoning the supreme court approved the lower courts interpretation of the information society services act and reiterated that an information society service provider falling under that act and the directive on electronic commerce had neither knowledge of nor control over information which was transmitted or stored by contrast a provider of content services governed the content of information that was being stored in the present case the applicant company had integrated the comment environment into its news portal and invited users to post comments the number of comments had an effect on the number of visits to the portal and on the applicant companys revenue from advertisements published on the portal thus the applicant company had an economic interest in the comments the fact that the applicant company did not write the comments itself did not imply that it had no control over the comment environment it enacted the rules of comment and removed comments if the rules were breached the users on the contrary could not change or delete the comments they had posted they could merely report obscene comments thus the applicant company could determine which comments were published and which not the fact that it made no use of this possibility did not mean that it had no control over the publishing of the comments furthermore the supreme court considered that in the present case both the applicant company and the authors of the comments were to be considered publishers of the comments in this context it also referred to the economic interest of an internet portals administrator which made it a publisher as entrepreneur similarly to a publisher of printed media the supreme court found that the plaintiff was free to choose against whom to bring the suit and l had chosen to bring the suit against the applicant company the supreme court found that on the basis of its legal obligation to avoid causing damage to other persons the applicant company should have prevented clearly unlawful comments from being published furthermore after the comments had been published it had failed to remove them on its own initiative although it must have been aware of their unlawfulness the courts had rightly found that the applicant companys failure to act had been unlawful d subsequent developments according to information posted on october by delfi on its internet portal delfi did not allow persons who had posted offensive comments to post a new comment until the commenter had read and accepted the rules of commenting furthermore it was announced that delfi had set up a team of moderators who carried out followup moderation of comments posted on the portal first of all the moderators reviewed all user notices of inappropriate comments the compliance of comments with the rules of commenting was monitored as well according to the information published the number of comments posted by delfis readers in august had been delfis moderators had removed comments about mainly consisting of spam or irrelevant comments the share of defamatory comments had been less than of the total number of comments ii

of ministers of the council of europe adopted at the th meeting of the ministers deputies the declaration on freedom of communication on the internet it reads in the relevant part as follows the member states of the council of europe convinced also that it is necessary to limit the liability of service providers when they act as mere transmitters or when they in good faith provide access to or host content from third parties recalling in this respect directive ec of the european parliament and of the council of june on certain legal aspects of information society services in particular electronic commerce in the internal market directive on electronic commerce stressing that freedom of communication on the internet should not prejudice the human dignity human rights and fundamental freedoms of others especially minors considering that a balance has to be found between respecting the will of users of the internet not to disclose their identity and the need for law enforcement authorities to trace those responsible for criminal acts declare that they seek to abide by the following principles in the field of communication on the internet principle content rules for the internet member states should not subject content on the internet to restrictions which go further than those applied to other means of content delivery principle absence of prior state control public authorities should not through general blocking or filtering measures deny access by the public to information and other communication on the internet regardless of frontiers this does not prevent the installation of filters for the protection of minors in particular in places accessible to them such as schools or libraries provided that the safeguards of article paragraph of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms are respected measures may be taken to enforce the removal of clearly identifiable internet content or alternatively the blockage of access to it if the competent national authorities have taken a provisional or final decision on its illegality principle limited liability of service providers for internet content member states should not impose on service providers a general obligation to monitor content on the internet to which they give access that they transmit or store nor that of actively seeking facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity member states should ensure that service providers are not held liable for content on the internet when their function is limited as defined by national law to transmitting information or providing access to the internet in cases where the functions of service providers are wider and they store content emanating from other parties member states may hold them coresponsible if they do not act expeditiously to remove or disable access to information or services as soon as they become aware as defined by national law of their illegal nature or in the event of a claim for damages of facts or circumstances revealing the illegality of the activity or information when defining under national law the obligations of service providers as set out in the previous paragraph due care must be taken to respect the freedom of expression of those who made the information available in the first place as well as the corresponding right of users to the information in all cases the abovementioned limitations of liability should not affect the possibility of issuing injunctions where service providers are required to terminate or prevent to the extent possible an infringement of the law principle anonymity in order to ensure protection against online surveillance and to enhance the free expression of information and ideas member states should respect the will of users of the internet not to disclose their identity this does not prevent member states from taking measures and cooperating in order to trace those responsible for criminal acts in accordance with national law the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and other international agreements in the fields of justice and the police b european union documents directive ec directive ec of the european parliament and of the council of june on certain legal aspects of information society services in particular electronic commerce in the internal market directive on electronic commerce provides as follows the free movement of information society services can in many cases be a specific reflection in community law of a more general principle namely freedom of expression as enshrined in article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms which has been ratified by all the member states for this reason directives covering the supply of information society services must ensure that this activity may be engaged in freely in the light of that article subject only to the restrictions laid down in paragraph of that article and in article of the treaty this directive is not intended to affect national fundamental rules and principles relating to freedom of expression the exemptions from liability established in this directive cover only cases where the activity of the information society service provider is limited to the technical process of operating and giving access to a communication network over which information made available by third parties is transmitted or temporarily stored for the sole purpose of making the transmission more efficient this activity is of a mere technical automatic and passive nature which implies that the information society service provider has neither knowledge of nor control over the information which is transmitted or stored a service provider can benefit from the exemptions for mere conduit and for caching when he is in no way involved with the information transmitted this requires among other things that he does not modify the information that he transmits this requirement does not cover manipulations of a technical nature which take place in the course of the transmission as they do not alter the integrity of the information contained in the transmission a service provider who deliberately collaborates with one of the recipients of his service in order to undertake illegal acts goes beyond the activities of mere conduit or caching and as a result can not benefit from the liability exemptions established for these activities the limitations of the liability of intermediary service providers established in this directive do not affect the possibility of injunctions of different kinds such injunctions can in particular consist of orders by courts or administrative authorities requiring the termination or prevention of any infringement including the removal of illegal information or the disabling of access to it in order to benefit from a limitation of liability the provider of an information society service consisting of the storage of information upon obtaining actual knowledge or awareness of illegal activities has to act expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information concerned the removal or disabling of access has to be undertaken in the observance of the principle of freedom of expression and of procedures established for this purpose at national level this directive does not affect member states possibility of establishing specific requirements which must be fulfilled expeditiously prior to the removal or disabling of information member states are prevented from imposing a monitoring obligation on service providers only with respect to obligations of a general nature this does not concern monitoring obligations in a specific case and in particular does not affect orders by national authorities in accordance with national legislation this directive does not affect the possibility for member states of requiring service providers who host information provided by recipients of their service to apply duties of care which can reasonably be expected from them and which are specified by national law in order to detect and prevent certain types of illegal activities article

directive ec of the european parliament and of the council of june laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on information society services as amended by directive ec provides as follows article for the purposes of this directive the following meanings shall apply service any information society service that is to say any service normally provided for remuneration at a distance by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services for the purposes of this definition at a distance means that the service is provided without the parties being simultaneously present by electronic means means that the service is sent initially and received at its destination by means of electronic equipment for the processing including digital compression and storage of data and entirely transmitted conveyed and received by wire by radio by optical means or by other electromagnetic means at the individual request of a recipient of services means that the service is provided through the transmission of data on individual request an indicative list of services not covered by this definition is set out in annex vthis directive shall not apply to radio broadcasting services television broadcasting services covered by point a of article of directive eec caselaw of the court of justice of the european union in a judgment of march joined cases c to c google france and google ecr i the court of justice of the european union considered that in order to establish whether the liability of a referencing service provider may be limited under article of directive it is necessary to examine whether the role played by that service provider is neutral in the sense that its conduct is merely technical automatic and passive pointing to a lack of knowledge or control of the data which it stores article of the directive on electronic commerce must be interpreted as meaning that the rule laid down therein applies to an internet referencing service provider in the event that that service provider has not played an active role of such a kind as to give it knowledge of or control over the data stored if it has not played such a role that service provider can not be held liable for the data which it has stored at the request of an advertiser unless having obtained knowledge of the unlawful nature of those data or of that advertisers activities it failed to act expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the data concerned in a judgment of july case c loréal and others the court of justice of the european union ruled that article of directive was to be interpreted as applying to the operator of an online marketplace where that operator had not played an active role allowing it to have knowledge or control of the data stored the operator played such a role when it provided assistance which entailed in particular optimising the presentation of the offers for sale in question or promoting them where the operator of the online marketplace had not played such an active role and the service provided fell as a consequence within the scope of article of directive the operator none the less could not in a case which could result in an order to pay damages rely on the exemption from liability provided for under that article if it had been aware of facts or circumstances on the basis of which a diligent economic operator should have realised that the offers for sale in question had been unlawful and in the event of it being so aware had failed to act expeditiously in accordance with article b of directive in a judgment of november case c scarlet extended the court of justice of the european union ruled that an injunction may not be made against an internet service provider which required it to install a system for filtering all electronic communications passing via its services in particular those involving the use of peertopeer software which applied indiscriminately to all its customers as a preventive measure exclusively at its expense and for an unlimited period which was capable of identifying on that providers network the movement of electronic files containing a musical cinematographic or audiovisual work in respect of which the applicant claimed to hold intellectual property rights with a view to blocking the transfer of files the sharing of which would infringe copyright the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that holding it liable for the comments posted by the readers of its internet news portal infringed its freedom of expression as provided in article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the government pointed out that according to the applicant company it had been neither the author nor the discloser of the defamatory comments the government noted that if the court shared that view the application was incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the convention as the convention did not protect the freedom of expression of a person who was neither the author nor the discloser the applicant company could not claim to be a victim of a violation of the freedom of expression of persons whose comments had been deleted nevertheless the government were of the opinion that in fact the applicant company was the discloser of the defamatory comments the applicant company disagreed it contended that the obligation imposed on it to maintain a preventive censorship policy over the exercise of freedom of expression of third persons also infringed its freedom of expression that is freedom to impart information created and published by third persons the court notes that the applicant company was sued for defamation in respect of comments posted on its internet portal it was deemed to be discloser or publisher the estonian words avaldamaavaldaja mean both disclosediscloser and publishpublisher see for example paragraphs and above of the comments along with their authors and held liable for its failure to prevent the disclosure of or remove on its own initiative the unlawful comments it was obliged by the domestic courts to pay the plaintiff compensation for nonpecuniary damage he had sustained thus the applicant company was directly affected by the domestic courts decisions the court considers that the applicant companys grievance relates to freedom of expression and falls within the scope of article of the convention therefore the governments objection has to be dismissed the court further notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention nor is it inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissionsa the applicant the applicant company argued that the domestic courts had interfered with its freedom of expression right to impart information it submitted that it had been forced to alter its business model completely and compelled to monitor every comment posted on its news portal up to comments a day although certain technical and manual procedures had already been applied prior to the supreme courts judgment the scope of that activity and its legal implications had substantially changed as a result of the judgment concerned the applicant company argued that the interference with its freedom of expression had not been prescribed by law it argued that the civil law provisions relied on by the supreme court embodied a negative obligation not to publish defamatory information in the applicant companys view there was no obligation in the domestic law for it to premonitor all the content posted by third persons the domestic courts interpretation of the pertinent legislation had not met the requirement of foreseeability the applicant company further argued that the liability of service providers for the disclosure of third party content was limited under the eu directive on electronic commerce transposed into the estonian legal order as the information society services act the applicant company accepted that the reputation and rights of l had been engaged in the present case however it considered that the authors of the comments were liable for the possible infringement of ls rights holding the applicant company liable pursued no legitimate aim the applicant company argued that the restriction imposed on its freedom of expression was not necessary in a democratic society it noted that the article published by it had been a balanced one and thus the comments created and published by the commentators had not been provoked or triggered by the deeds of the applicant company it argued that it was sufficient that the personal rights of individuals were protected by a twolimb system firstly by the noticeandtakedown system operated by the service provider and secondly by the possibility of bringing a claim against the authors of the comments referring to the cases of google france and google and loréal and others of the court of justice of the european union the applicant company argued that it had not played an active role but had merely stored comments on its server set the terms of its service been indirectly remunerated for that service and provided general information to its customers readers commentators the applicant company further referred to the declaration on freedom of communication on the internet and article of the directive on electronic commerce and argued that a host was not obliged to seek or monitor the hosted material such an overly burdensome obligation was contrary to freedom of expression and information the fact that the applicant company had acted diligently and implemented various technical and manual procedures to reduce the number of illegal comments from the comments area of its portal should not mean that it was liable for illegal content posted by third parties otherwise hosts who took no measures whatsoever to eliminate illegal material would be encouraged and diligent hosts punished in conclusion the applicant company asserted that it had only played a passive role in hosting the comments it had had no active knowledge of the illicit comments nor had it been or should have been aware of the illicit comments before the relevant notice by l after which the applicant company had promptly removed the comments thus the applicant company had acted in accordance with the standards to be observed by a diligent economic operator and its freedom to impart information via the commenting area of its news portal had been disproportionately interfered withb the government the government submitted that delfi continued to be one of the largest internet portals in estonia the articles published by it were commented on extensively and people could do so without identifying themselves thus the government rejected the applicant companys argument that it had had to change its business model furthermore the government pointed out that the applicant company had also admitted monitoring comments on its own initiative on some occasions even before the proceedings giving rise to the present application the government argued that the obligation to avoid causing harm had a clear basis in law and was confirmed by comprehensive caselaw see paragraphs to above a media publication was usually liable for what it published and its liability could not be precluded by a disclaimer published by the applicant company as pursuant to the obligations act an agreement which precluded or restricted liability for damage caused unlawfully was void pursuant to the domestic law authors and owners of media publications had joint and several liability the government maintained that since the publication of comments was under the control of the applicant company and in practice delfi also exercised partial control it was obliged to protect the honour of other persons and the restriction concerned had a legitimate aim with regard to the applicant company the government contended that the restriction was necessary in a democratic society the vulgar insulting and degrading value judgments contained in the comments in the present case had had no reasonable factual basis there was therefore nothing in the comments which would have required the portal administrator to do any work to check their veracity since delfi had not removed the posted comments on its own initiative and it must have been aware that they were unlawful the estonian courts had justly found that delfis omission was unlawful the disclaimer stating that the comments were not the opinion of the applicant company and that the authors of comments were responsible for their content did not preclude the applicant companys liability the government argued that placing the obligation to monitor the comments and notify the portal administrator of offensive comments on the possibly injured parties was neither sufficient nor justified such a system did not ensure sufficient protection of the rights of third parties as proven by the circumstances of the present case any information communicated via the internet spread so quickly that by the time the inappropriate comments were finally deleted the public interest in the given news and the comments posted on it had waned measures taken weeks or even days later for protecting a persons honour were no longer sufficient because offensive or unlawful comments had already reached the public and done their damage since controlling the internet was an impossible task for an ordinary person the party with control over a specific portal had the duty to take action where necessary to prevent violation of personality rights the government noted that estonia had chosen to apply less restrictive civil as opposed to criminal liability in defamation cases however even if a court adjudicating a civil case was able to identify the ip address of a computer and the address where the computer was located it was extremely difficult to identify the person who actually wrote the comment thus as delfi did not identify the commentators this made it too difficult for an injured person to have recourse to the civil courts against anonymous authors of comments furthermore the government considered that the states enacting of a regulation providing for mandatory identification of commentators on an internet portal would constitute an excessive interference thus it was more suitable and proportionate in civil proceedings to place greater liability joint and several for defamation on a portal owner who provided content services the government pointed out in this context that delfi was a profitoriented company which had invited visitors to its portal to comment on its articles without identifying the authors of the comments at the same time the income it earned depended on the advertisements published on the portal which in turn depended on the number of comments the government referred to the domestic courts finding that delfi had not acted with the due diligence required in commerce it had not taken measures which would have precluded the risk of violation of other persons rights at the same time the domestic courts had not prescribed to delfi how it should perform its duties leaving this matter for the applicant company and considering that there were various means of doing this the government argued that the applicant company was not a hosting service provider for the purposes of the information society services act when publishing comments posted on delfis articles a hosting service provider offered merely a data storage service while the stored data their insertion removal and content including ability to remove or change the stored data remained under the control of service users in the delfi commenting environment those commenting lost control of their comments as soon as they had entered them and commenters could not change or delete their comments thus delfi was not a technical intermediary in respect of comments but a content service provider it deleted and modified comments if needed and had also done so prior to the supreme courts judgment playing therefore an active role of such a kind as to give it knowledge of or control over the data relating to the comments to its articles the fact that delfi had taken measures to minimise insulting comments for example by screening demonstrated that delfi had actually been aware of its liability the government also pointed out that the comments in question had not attacked the public limited company concerned but a member of its supervisory board personally and could not therefore be justified by the exercise by the press of its role of a public watchdog the comments had resorted to offensive and intemperate language and had gone beyond a generally acceptable degree of exaggeration or provocation they had not stimulated any reasonable public discussion lastly the government considered that the sum the applicant company had been ordered to pay l as compensation for nonpecuniary damage corresponding to eur had not had a chilling effect on the freedom of expression the thirdparty interveners arguments the helsinki foundation for human rights in warsaw provided an analysis of the polish law concerning the liability related to publication of materials on the internet it noted that polish caselaw was inconsistent in some cases news portals had not been held responsible for comments posted by the readers in other cases blogowners or forum administrators had been held responsible for thirdparty comments the helsinki foundation reiterated that prior restraint was a particularly restrictive measure and it also indicated a variety of problems related to the noticeandtakedown procedure which called for more precise regulation the courts assessmenta existence of an interference the court notes that the focus of the parties arguments differed as regards the applicant companys role in the present case the government were of the opinion that the applicant company was to be considered the discloser of the defamatory comments whereas the applicant company considered that the comments had been published by third parties and the applicant companys freedom to impart information had been interfered with see paragraphs and above regardless of the exact role to be attributed to the applicant companys activities it is not in substance in dispute between the parties that the domestic courts decisions in respect of the applicant company constituted an interference with its freedom of expression guaranteed under article of the convention the court sees no reason to hold otherwise see also paragraph above such an interference with the applicant companys right to freedom of expression must be prescribed by law have one or more legitimate aims in the light of paragraph of article and be necessary in a democratic societyb lawfulness the court reiterates that a norm can not be regarded as a law within the meaning of article unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct he must be able if need be with appropriate advice to foresee to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances the consequences which a given action may entail those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty whilst certainty is desirable it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances accordingly many laws are inevitably couched in terms which to a greater or lesser extent are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice see for example lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc nos and echr iv the court further reiterates that the scope of the notion of foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the text in issue the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed a law may still satisfy the requirement of foreseeability even if the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances the consequences which a given action may entail this is particularly true in relation to persons carrying on a professional activity who are used to having to proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation they can on this account be expected to take special care in assessing the risks that such activity entails see lindon otchakovsky laurens and july loc cit with further references to cantoni v france november reports of judgments and decisions v and chauvy and others v france no echr vi the court notes that in the present case the parties opinions differed as to the question whether the interference with the applicant companys freedom of expression was prescribed by law the applicant company argued that the domestic law did not entail a positive obligation to premonitor content posted by third persons and that its liability was limited under the eu directive on electronic commerce the government referred to the pertinent provisions of the civil law and domestic caselaw under which media publications were liable for their publications along with the authors as regards the applicant companys argument that its liability was limited under the eu directive on electronic commerce and the information society services act the court notes that the domestic courts found that the applicant companys activities did not fall within the scope of these acts the court reiterates in this context that it is not its task to take the place of the domestic courts it is primarily for the national authorities notably the courts to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation the courts role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the convention see among others pérez de rada cavanilles v spain october reports of judgments and decisions viii the court further notes that pursuant to the pertinent provisions of the constitution the civil code general principles act and the obligations act see paragraphs to above as interpreted and applied by the domestic courts the applicant company was deemed liable for the publication of the defamatory comments although these provisions are quite general and lack detail in comparison with for example the information society services act see paragraph above the court is satisfied that they along with the pertinent caselaw made it clear that a media publisher was liable for any defamatory statements made in its media publication the fact that in the present case publication of articles and comments on an internet portal was also found to amount to journalistic activity and the administrator of the portal as an entrepreneur was deemed to be a publisher can be seen in the courts view as application of the existing tort law to a novel area related to new technologies compare for example bernh larsen holding as and others v norway no march where the court saw no reason to question the domestic courts interpretation according to which legal provisions originally conceived in respect of hard copies of documents were also deemed to apply to electronically stored documents this does not mean that the provisions of the civil law in question did not constitute a sufficiently clear legal basis for the applicant companys liability or that gradual clarification of legal rules was outlawed compare mutatis mutandis radio france and others v france no and echr ii indeed general provisions of law can at times make for a better adaptation to changing circumstances than can attempts at detailed regulation see for comparison times newspapers ltd v the united kingdom nos and nos and and echr where the internet publication rule relied on a rule originally dating from the year and editorial board of pravoye delo and shtekel v ukraine no echr extracts where the lack of reference to internet publications in the otherwise quite detailed media law gave rise to an issue of lawfulness under article of the convention the court accordingly finds that as a professional publisher the applicant company must at least have been familiar with the legislation and caselaw and could also have sought legal advice the court observes in this context that the delfi news portal is one of the largest in estonia and also that a degree of notoriety has been attributable to comments posted in its commenting area thus the court considers that the applicant company was in a position to assess the risks related to its activities and that it must have been able to foresee to a reasonable degree the consequences which these could entail it therefore finds that the interference in issue was prescribed by law within the meaning of the second paragraph of article of the conventionc legitimate aim the court considers that the restriction of the applicant companys freedom of expression pursued a legitimate aim of protecting the reputation and rights of others the court has taken note of the applicant companys argument about the liability of the actual authors of the comments however in the courts view the fact that the actual authors were also in principle liable does not remove the legitimate aim of holding the applicant company liable for any damage to the reputation and rights of others the question of whether the applicant companys rights under article were excessively restricted in the present case by holding it liable for comments written by third parties is a question of whether the restriction was necessary in a democratic society to be dealt with belowd necessary in a democratic societyi general principles the fundamental principles concerning the question whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the courts caselaw and have been summarised as follows see among other authorities hertel v switzerland august reports of judgments and decisions vi steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no echr extracts and animal defenders international v the united kingdom gc no april i freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society as set forth in article this freedom is subject to exceptions which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article iii the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts furthermore the court reiterates the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society although the press must not overstep certain bounds particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information its duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities information and ideas on all matters of public interest see jersild v denmark september series a no de haes and gijsels v belgium february reports of judgments and decisions i and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii in addition the court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no and bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above the limits of permissible criticism are narrower in relation to a private citizen than in relation to politicians or governments see for example castells v spain april series a no incal v turkey june reports of judgments and decisions iv and tammer v estonia no echr i the court reiterates that the right to protection of reputation is a right which is protected by article of the convention as part of the right to respect for private life see chauvy and others cited above pfeifer v austria no november and polanco torres and movilla polanco v spain no september in order for article to come into play however an attack on a persons reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be made in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see a v norway no april and axel springer ag v germany gc no february when examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interests of the protection of the reputation or rights of others the court may be required to ascertain whether the domestic authorities have struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see hachette filipacchi associés v france no june mgn limited v the united kingdom no january and axel springer ag cited above the court has found that as a matter of principle the rights guaranteed under articles and deserve equal respect and the outcome of an application should not in principle vary according to whether it has been lodged with the court under article of the convention by the publisher of an offending article or under article of the convention by the person who has been the subject of that article accordingly the margin of appreciation should in principle be the same in both cases see axel springer ag cited above and von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr with further references to the cases of hachette filipacchi associés ici paris cited above timciuc v romania dec no october and mosley v the united kingdom no may the court has considered that where the right to freedom of expression is being balanced against the right to respect for private life the relevant criteria in the balancing exercise include the following elements contribution to a debate of general interest how well known the person concerned is the subject of the report the prior conduct of the person concerned the method of obtaining the information and its veracity the content form and consequences of the publication and the severity of the sanction imposed see axel springer ag cited above and von hannover no cited above ii application of the principles to the present case turning to the present case the court notes at the outset that there is no dispute that comments posted by readers in reaction to the news article published on the applicant companys internet news portal were of a defamatory nature indeed the applicant company promptly removed the comments once it was notified by the injured party and described them as infringing and illicit before the court however the parties views differ as to whether the applicant companys civil liability for the defamatory comments amounted to a disproportionate interference with its freedom of expression in other words the question is whether the applicant companys obligation as established by the domestic judicial authorities to ensure that comments posted on its internet portal did not infringe the personality rights of third persons was in accordance with the guarantees set out in article of the convention in order to resolve this question the court will proceed to analyse in turn a number of factors which it considers to be of importance in the circumstances of the present case firstly the court will examine the context of the comments secondly the measures applied by the applicant company in order to prevent or remove defamatory comments thirdly the liability of the actual authors of the comments as an alternative to the applicant companys liability and fourthly the consequences of the domestic proceedings for the applicant company the court notes that the news article published on the delfi news portal addressed a topic of a certain degree of public interest it discussed a shipping companys moving its ferries from one route to another and in doing so breaking the ice at potential locations of ice roads as a result of which the opening of such roads a cheaper and faster connection to the islands compared to the companys ferry services was postponed for several weeks the article itself was a balanced one a manager of the shipping company was given the opportunity to provide explanations and the article contained no offensive language indeed the article itself gave rise to no arguments about defamation in the domestic proceedings nevertheless the article dealt with the shipping companys activities that negatively affected a large number of people therefore the court considers that the applicant company by publishing the article in question could have realised that it might cause negative reactions against the shipping company and its managers and that considering the general reputation of comments on the delfi news portal there was a higherthanaverage risk that the negative comments could go beyond the boundaries of acceptable criticism and reach the level of gratuitous insult or hate speech it also appears that the number of comments posted on the article in question was above average and indicated a great deal of interest in the matter among the readers and those who posted their comments thus the court concludes that the applicant company was expected to exercise a degree of caution in the circumstances of the present case in order to avoid being held liable for an infringement of other persons reputations as regards the measures applied by the applicant company the court notes that in addition to the disclaimer stating that the writers of the comments and not the applicant company were accountable for them and that it was prohibited to post comments that were contrary to good practice or contained threats insults obscene expressions or vulgarities the applicant company had two general mechanisms in operation firstly it had an automatic system of deletion of comments based on stems of certain vulgar words secondly it had a noticeandtakedown system in place according to which anyone could notify it of an inappropriate comment by simply clicking on a button designated for that purpose to bring it to the attention of the portal administrators in addition on some occasions the administrators of the portal removed inappropriate comments on their own initiative thus the court considers that the applicant company can not be said to have wholly neglected its duty to avoid causing harm to third parties reputations nevertheless it would appear that the automatic wordbased filter used by the applicant company was relatively easy to circumvent although it may have prevented some of the insults or threats it failed to do so in respect of a number of others thus while there is no reason to doubt its usefulness the court considers that the wordbased filter as such was insufficient for preventing harm being caused to third persons the court has further had regard to the noticeandtakedown system as used by the applicant company indeed the question of whether by applying this system the applicant company had fulfilled its duty of diligence was one of the main points of disagreement between the parties in the present case the court firstly notes that the technical solution related to the delfi portals noticeandtakedown system was easily accessible and convenient for users there was no need to take any steps other than clicking on a button provided for that purpose there was no need to formulate reasons as to why a comment was considered inappropriate or to send a letter to the applicant company with the pertinent request although in the present case the interested person did not use the noticeandtakedown feature offered by the applicant company on its website but rather relied on making his claim in writing and sending it by mail this was his own choice and in any event there is no dispute that the defamatory comments were removed by the applicant company without delay after receipt of the notice nevertheless by that time the comments had already been accessible to the public for six weeks the court notes that in the interested persons opinion shared by the domestic courts the prior automatic filtering and noticeandtakedown system used by the applicant company did not ensure sufficient protection for the rights of third persons the domestic courts attached importance in this context to the fact that the publication of the news articles and making public the readers comments on these articles was part of the applicant companys professional activity it was interested in the number of readers as well as comments on which its advertising revenue depended the court considers this argument pertinent in determining the proportionality of the interference with the applicant companys freedom of expression it also finds that publishing defamatory comments on a large internet news portal as in the present case implies a wide audience for the comments the court further notes that the applicant company and not a person whose reputation could be at stake was in a position to know about an article to be published to predict the nature of the possible comments prompted by it and above all to take technical or manual measures to prevent defamatory statements from being made public indeed the actual writers of comments could not modify or delete their comments once posted on the delfi news portal only the applicant company had the technical means to do this thus the court considers that the applicant company exercised a substantial degree of control over the comments published on its portal even if it did not make as much use as it could have done of the full extent of the control at its disposal the court has also had regard to the fact that the domestic courts did not make any orders to the applicant company as to how the latter should ensure the protection of third parties rights leaving the choice to the applicant company thus no specific measures such as a requirement of prior registration of users before they were allowed to post comments monitoring comments by the applicant company before making them public or speedy review of comments after posting to name just a few were imposed on the applicant company the court considers the leeway left to the applicant company in this respect to be an important factor reducing the severity of the interference with its freedom of expression the court has taken note of the applicant companys argument that the affected person could have brought a claim against the actual authors of the comments it attaches more weight however to the governments counterargument that for the purposes of bringing a civil claim it was very difficult for an individual to establish the identity of the persons to be sued indeed for purely technical reasons it would appear disproportionate to put the onus of identification of the authors of defamatory comments on the injured person in a case like the present one keeping in mind the states positive obligations under article that may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves see von hannover no cited above with further references the court is not convinced that measures allowing an injured party to bring a claim only against the authors of defamatory comments as the applicant company appears to suggest would have in the present case guaranteed effective protection of the injured persons right to private life it notes that it was the applicant companys choice to allow comments by nonregistered users and that by doing so it must be considered to have assumed a certain responsibility for these comments the court is mindful in this context of the importance of the wishes of internet users not to disclose their identity in exercising their freedom of expression at the same time the spread of the internet and the possibility or for some purposes the danger that information once made public will remain public and circulate forever calls for caution the ease of disclosure of information on the internet and the substantial amount of information there means that it is a difficult task to detect defamatory statements and remove them this is so for an internet news portal operator as in the present case but this is an even more onerous task for a potentially injured person who would be less likely to possess resources for continual monitoring of the internet the court considers the latter element an important factor in balancing the rights and interests at stake it also refers in this context to the krone verlag no judgment where it found that shifting the defamed persons risk to obtain redress for defamation proceedings to the media company usually in a better financial position than the defamer was not as such a disproportionate interference with the media companys right to freedom of expression see krone verlag gmb h co kg v austria no no november lastly the court notes that the applicant company was obliged to pay the affected person the equivalent of eur in nonpecuniary damages the court is of the opinion that this sum also taking into account that the applicant company was a professional operator of one of the largest internet news portals in estonia can by no means be considered disproportionate to the breach established by the domestic courts based on the above elements in particular the insulting and threatening nature of the comments the fact that the comments were posted in reaction to an article published by the applicant company in its professionallymanaged news portal run on a commercial basis the insufficiency of the measures taken by the applicant company to avoid damage being caused to other parties reputations and to ensure a realistic possibility that the authors of the comments will be held liable and the moderate sanction imposed on the applicant company the court considers that in the present case the domestic courts finding that the applicant company was liable for the defamatory comments posted by readers on its internet news portal was a justified and proportionate restriction on the applicant companys right to freedom of expression there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on october pursuant to rule and of the rules

3,is a newspaper published in baku it has legal personality under azerbaijani law the second applicant a founder and the editorinchief of khural was born in and lives in baku the applicants were represented by mr e sadigov and mr r hajili lawyers based in baku and strasbourg respectively the government were represented by their agent mr ç əsgərov the facts of the case may be summarised as follows civil defamation proceedings against the first applicant on may an article concerning a wellknown highranking government official the head of the presidential administration mr ramiz mehdiyev rm and his alleged relationships with a prominent azerbaijani poet bakhtiyar vahabzade bv and the exhead of the executive authority in sheki ashraf mammadov am was published in khural the title of the article was ramiz mehdiyevs plan to finish bakhtiyar vahabzade why did the head of the presidential administration have to punish the sheki community and the head of its executive authority relevant extracts from the article appear in paragraph below mr elchin ugurtaj was mentioned as the author of the article from the material submitted to the court it is not clear whether the name in question was that of a real person or a pen name in june rm lodged a civil action against the first applicant with the narimanov district court arguing that the abovementioned article contained false statements damaging his honour dignity and professional reputation rm asked the court to order the first applicant to issue an apology and refutation and to pay azerbaijani manats azn for nonpecuniary damage to be transferred to an orphanage rm argued in particular that the title of the impugned article and certain extracts from it were defamatory the extracts concerned read as followsi in fact the incident described in an article called mafia and the press published in gundam khabar happened not in one of the districts of baku but in sheki the one who was gravely insulted was not some ordinary man but bakhtiyar vahabzade a famous azerbaijani poet yes the exhead of executive authority in sheki ashraf mammadov was given an order by ramiz mehdiyev not to allow bakhtiyar vahabzade being elected and that was a part of a very serious plan in that manner mehdiyev wanted to gain revenge on bakhtiyar vahabzade who hated him for many yearsii ashraf mammadovs black days began after he had refused to obey ramiz mehdiyevs order no one would forget the wellknown events that had happened in sheki during the parliamentary elections yes indeed all of that was a scheme and both the sheki community and ashraf mammadov had to be punished because ramiz mehdiyev failed to implement his big plan the plan to crush bakhtiyar vahabzade in sheki that is why revenge had to be takeniii it is rumoured that the late president heydar aliyev did not allow the central election commission to annul bakhtiyar vahabzades deputy mandate and thus proved to mehdiyev who had the last word as it is also rumoured that mehdiyev had taken on such initiativeiv bakhtiyar vahabzade became an enemy of ramiz mehdiyev and the latter played the key role in the machine importing harmful ideas to azerbaijan and it is now clear that the only reason why bakhtiyar vahabzade was targeted was that he was a turkic nationalist mehdiyev not only insulted bakhtiyar vahabzade but also plotted conspiracy theories against him but none of that succeeded so now mehdiyev is taking revenge on bakhtiyar vahabzade by not perpetuating his name after the latters death according to information submitted by the government the events cited in one of the abovementioned statements see paragraph ii above refer to a riot which had broken out against am in sheki in on july the narimanov district court allowed rms civil action finding the title of the article and the extracts from it defamatory the firstinstance court noted in particular that the title and the extracts from the article suggested that rm hated bv and that rm had therefore tried without success to prevent his being elected as a member of parliament in had organised the events of in sheki in order to punish am for disobeying had tried to have bvs mandate as an mp called off and had prevented memorialising bv after the latters death furthermore the court noted that those allegations were statements affecting rms reputation and lacking any factual basis that the first applicant had failed to submit any evidence proving those allegations against rm and that the article in question constituted an abuse of the right to freedom of expression the firstinstance court ordered the first applicant to issue an apology and refutation the first applicant was also ordered to pay azn which at the material time was equivalent to approximately euros eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage to be transferred to an orphanage as requested by the plaintiff the first applicant appealed arguing that by publishing the article in question it had performed its role of public watchdog reporting on topics of high public interest that rm who was a wellknown highranking government official should have displayed a greater degree of tolerance of criticism against him that the statements made in the article constituted value judgments and therefore were not susceptible of proof and that the article merely reproduced and commented on information which had been published earlier in gundam khabar gündəm xəbər newspaper in may in an article entitled mafia and the press mafiya və mətbuat the relevant part of the abovementioned article published in gundam khabar had stated the following once an exhead of the executive authority of one of the biggest districts in baku told what had happened to him he said that there had been a writer who had lived in that district for many years and had run as a candidate for the parliamentary elections sometime before the elections ramiz mehdiyev called and ordered me to ensure that another person indicated by him was elected i was forced to obey ramiz mehdiyevs order on september the baku court of appeal upheld the judgment of the firstinstance court reiterating the same grounds to which the firstinstance court had referred see paragraph above the first applicant lodged a cassation appeal reiterating its earlier complaints on february the supreme court dismissed the appeal as unfounded and upheld the lower courts judgments reiterating the same grounds to which the lower courts had referred further developments according to the government the applicants did not publish an apology or refutation or pay the nonpecuniary damages as ordered by the domestic courts according to the applicants on october property belonging to the first applicant such as computers printers heating devices and telephones was seized under a decision qərardad given by the narimanov district court on the same day to ensure the payment of the award for nonpecuniary damage in question inter alia according to the applicants after the abovementioned seizure of its belongings khural ceased publication however it appears that its internet version wwwxuralcom has remained active it is not clear whether the newspaper resumed publication in paper version at a later stage according to an article published on the internet version of khural on december publishing houses had refused to publish khural and therefore the first applicants staff decided to publish a new newspaper called asi asi̇ it is not clear whether the plan to publish a new newspaper ever came to fruition relevant legal framework the relevant parts of article of the civil code of the civil code provided as follows article protection of honour dignity and business reputation an individual is entitled to obtain by way of a court order a retraction of information harming his or her honour dignity or business reputation disclosing secrets relating to his or her private or family life or breaching his or her personal or family inviolability provided that the person who disseminated such information fails to prove that the information was true the same rule shall also apply in cases of incomplete publication of factual information if as a result the honour dignity or business reputation of an individual is harmed if information harming the honour dignity or business reputation of an individual or invading the secrecy of his or her private or family life is disseminated in the mass media the information shall be retracted in the same mass media source if the mass media publish information breaching an individuals rights and interests protected by law that individual has the right to publish his or her reply in the same mass media source in addition to the right to seek a retraction of the information harming his or her honour dignity or business reputation the individual has the right to claim compensation for damage caused by the dissemination of such information the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicants complained under article of the convention that the civil defamation proceedings against the first applicant and the ensuing penalty had been in breach of their right to freedom of expression article of the convention provides everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the first applicant the court notes that in so far as the first applicant is concerned this complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible the second applicant the government argued that the second applicant could not claim to be a victim of the alleged breach of article because he had not been a party to the domestic civil defamation proceedings and because the decisions of the domestic courts had concerned only the rights and duties of the first applicant furthermore neither of the two applicants provided any information about the ownership of the first applicant such as for example a document showing that the second applicant had a share if any in the first applicant the government argued therefore that the application was incompatible ratione personae in the part concerning the second applicant the second applicant argued that he held victim status because he was a founder and the editorinchief of khural the court notes that the word victim in the context of article of the convention denotes the person or persons directly or indirectly affected by the alleged violation see sarl du parc d activités de blotzheim v france no july hence article concerns not just the direct victim or victims of the alleged violation but also any indirect victims to whom the violation would cause harm or who would have a valid and personal interest in seeing it brought to an end see mutatis mutandis vallianatos and others v greece gc nos and echr extracts as regards the second applicant in the present case the court observes that he was not a party to the domestic civil defamation proceedings and his participation in those proceedings was limited to being a representative of the first applicant the only respondent party in those proceedings was the first applicant the domestic courts decisions did not impose any obligations on the second applicant the court notes in that regard that the first applicant possessed a legal personality as a registered media entity and consequently had its own rights and responsibilities distinct from those of its founder and editorinchief the second applicant compare obukhova v russia dec no december and kumok v ukraine dec no may furthermore the second applicant did not argue that he was the author of the impugned article and consequently it can not be said that the domestic proceedings affected him as a journalist contrast godlevskiy v russia no october in view of the foregoing considerations the court finds that the second applicant can not claim to be a victim of the alleged violation of article this part of the application is thus incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the convention and the protocols thereto within the meaning of article a and must be rejected according to article merits the parties submissions the first applicant submitted that there had been an unjustified and disproportionate interference with its right to freedom of expression it argued in particular that in publishing the article in question it had been fulfilling its role of public watchdog reporting on issues of high public interest in addition rm whom those statements concerned had been a wellknown highranking government official and in a democratic society therefore he should have displayed a greater degree of tolerance of criticism furthermore the impugned statements set out in the article in question had constituted value judgments and had therefore not been susceptible of proof the article in question had merely reproduced and commented on information which had been disseminated earlier in an article published in gundam khabar newspaper finally the first applicant emphasised that the penalty imposed on it for nonpecuniary damage had been unduly harsh and excessive and had caused its closure the government submitted that the interference with the first applicants right to freedom of expression had been prescribed by law in particular under article of the civil code it pursued a legitimate aim as it had been intended to protect rms reputation and rights the government emphasised that the domestic courts had carried out an analysis of two conflicting interests in conformity with the principles enshrined in article of the convention and had provided relevant and sufficient reasons for their decisions the interference had therefore been proportionate and necessary in a democratic society in the domestic proceedings the first applicant had not presented any evidence proving the veracity of the impugned statements as to the alleged harshness and excessiveness of the penalty imposed the government submitted that the first applicant had never raised that complaint before the domestic courts the courts assessmenta whether there was an interference the court considers that the judicial decisions given in the present case constituted an interference with the first applicants right to freedom of expression the interference will not be justified under the terms of article of the convention unless it is prescribed by law pursues one or more of the legitimate aims set out in paragraph of that article and is necessary in a democratic society for the achievement of that aim or those aimsb whether the interference was lawful and pursued a legitimate aim the court considers that the interference in the present case was prescribed by law as required by article of the convention namely by article of the civil code see paragraph above the court further accepts that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others within the meaning of article of the convention namely the good name of rmc whether the interference was necessary in a democratic societyi applicable general principles as provided for in article freedom of expression is subject to exceptions which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see among many other authorities stoll v switzerland gc no echr v and morice v france gc no echr the court emphasises the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society although it must not overstep certain bounds in particular in respect of the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information its duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities information and ideas on all matters of public interest thus the national authorities margin of appreciation is circumscribed by the interest of democratic society in enabling the press to exercise its vital role of public watchdog not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas the public also has a right to receive them were it otherwise the press would be unable to play its vital role of public watchdog see among many other authorities bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no and echr iiiα principles relevant to protection of reputation the court also reiterates that reputation is protected by article of the convention as part of the right to respect for private life see among many other authorities von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr and couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no echr extracts in order to fulfil its positive obligation to safeguard one persons rights under article the state may have to restrict to some extent the rights secured under article for another person when examining the necessity of that restriction in a democratic society in the interests of the protection of the reputation or rights of others the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases namely on the one hand freedom of expression as protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life as enshrined in article see among many other authorities bédat v switzerland gc no march in order for article to come into play however an attack on a persons reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see among many others axel springer ag v germany gc no february and medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june in its caselaw the court has identified a number of relevant criteria whereby the right to freedom of expression is balanced against the right to respect for private life including whether the impugned statements contributed to a debate of public interest the degree of notoriety of the person affected and the subject of the publication the context within which the impugned statements were made the content form and consequences of the publication the prior conduct of the person concerned the way in which the information was obtained and its veracity and the nature and severity of the penalty imposed see among many other authorities ibid and von hannover cited above a distinction has to be made between private individuals and individuals acting in a public context accordingly whilst a private individual unknown to the public may claim particular protection of his or her right to private life the same is not true of public figures in respect of whom limits of critical comment are wider as they are inevitably and knowingly exposed to public scrutiny and must therefore display a greater degree of tolerance see among many other authorities milisavljević v serbia no april and prunea v romania no january no doubt article enables the reputation of others that is to say of all individuals to be protected and this protection extends to politicians too even when they are not acting in their private capacity but in such cases the requirements of such protection have to be weighed in relation to the interests of open discussion of political issues see among many other authorities lingens v austria july series a no β principles relevant to the content form and consequences of the publication the court draws a distinction between statements of fact and value judgments the existence of facts can be demonstrated whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself however where a statement amounts to a value judgment the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement see among many other authorities morice cited above as regards value judgments which have been found by the national courts to be of a defamatory character the court assesses the national courts findings on the question whether the language used in the statement was of an excessive or dispassionate nature whether any intention of defaming or stigmatising the opponent was disclosed and whether the statement had a sufficient factual basis see do carmo de portugal e castro câmara v portugal no october the court also reiterates that there is little scope under article of the convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate concerning questions of public interest see among many other authorities sürek and özdemir v turkey gc nos and july and wingrove v the united kingdom november reports of judgments and decisions vγ principles relevant to the method of obtaining the information and its veracity as regards the method of obtaining the information and its veracity the court reiterates that article of the convention does not guarantee wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern under the terms of paragraph of that provision freedom of expression carries with it duties and responsibilities which also apply to the media even with respect to matters of serious public concern by reason of these duties and responsibilities the safeguard afforded by article to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of public interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism see among many other authorities fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i and pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi the existence of procedural safeguards for the benefit ofa defendant in defamation proceedings is among the factors to be taken into account in assessing the proportionality of an interference under article in particular it is important for the defendant to be afforded a realistic chance to prove that there was a sufficient factual basis for his allegations see among many other authorities morice cited above a distinction also needs to be made according to whether the statements emanate from the journalist or are a quotation of others since punishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person in an interview would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so see among many other authorities pedersen and baadsgaard cited above in timpul info magazin and anghel v moldova a case in which the domestic courts had based their findings solely on the passage in the impugned article containing accusations of bribery the court noted that the contested passage had been taken out of context although the accusations were serious ones the article read in its entirety clearly warned the reader that the rumour in question was unreliable the court reiterated in this judgment that the medias reporting on stories or rumours emanating from other persons or public opinion is also to be protected where they are not completely without foundation see timpul info magazin and anghel v moldova no november δ principles relevant to the nature and severity of the penalty imposed the court reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are also factors to be taken into consideration when assessing the proportionality of the interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see among many other authorities cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no echr xi the penalties imposed must not be such as to dissuade the press or others who engage in public debate from taking part in a discussion of matters of legitimate public concern see lewandowska malec v poland no september ii application of the above principles to the present case the court observes that several allegations against rm made in the title see paragraph above and the body see paragraph above of the impugned article formed the basis for the first applicants civil liability for defamation the impugned statements allegations can be summarised as follows a rm displayed animosity against and sought revenge on a prominent azerbaijani poet bv b rm ordered am to interfere in the parliamentary elections in sheki in one of the electoral constituencies where bv was standing as a candidate with the aim of preventing the latter from being elected c rm had fomented a riot against am which had happened in sheki in d rm had taken the initiative of annulling bvs mandate as an mp and e rm was refusing or otherwise impeding the memorialisation of bv after the latters death in the courts view those types of allegations of engaging in morally sensitive illegal or even criminal actions were capable of damaging rms good name the impugned statements therefore could be seen as attaining a level of seriousness sufficient to cause prejudice to rms reputation protected under article of the convention the court reiterates that in cases concerning a conflict between the right to reputation and the right to freedom of expression domestic courts hearing defamation claims are expected to perform a balancing exercise between those two rights applying the criteria established in the courts relevant caselaw see inter alia the caselaw summarised in paragraphs above and basing their decisions on relevant and sufficient reasons where such a balancing exercise has been undertaken the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see among others axel springer ag cited above delfi as v estonia gc no echr and medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above and however even though the domestic courts in the present case identified the relevant impugned statements as affecting rms reputation and lacking any factual basis and found that the first applicant had failed to submit any evidence regarding the allegations against rm in their examination see paragraphs and above they made no reference to the relevant criteria developed in the courts caselaw instead they examined the case only in terms of domestic civil law without taking into account its convention aspects they failed to examine inter alia whether the impugned statements concerned a matter of public interest take into account the context in which they were made or rms status as a wellknown highranking government official the courts reasoning in regard of the content and consequences of the article in question and the factual basis of the information provided in it was brief they failed to analyse various impugned statements separately and in detail and to establish inter alia whether some of those statements amounted to value judgments and whether the article in question was based on information which had been published earlier in gundam khabar it thus follows that contrary to the governments argument see paragraph above the domestic courts failed to carry out the required balancing exercise between the first applicants freedom of expression and rms rights and interests under article of the convention since the domestic courts did not apply the criteria laid down in the courts case law for balancing freedom of expression with the right to reputation the court finds that it must carry out the required balancing exercise itself for a similar approach see perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extracts and yefimov and youth human rights group v russia nos and december it will examine the necessity of the interference with the first applicants freedom of expression on the basis of the criteria generally applicable to the dissemination of statements affecting private life by the media namely whether the article in question contributed to a debate of public interest the degree of notoriety of the person affected the content and form of the impugned statements the way in which the information was obtained and its veracity and the nature and severity of the penalty imposedα whether the article in question contributed to a debate of public interest and the degree of notoriety of the person affected the impugned statements see the summary in paragraph above made in the article in question could undoubtedly contribute to a debate of public interest because they were about such issues as parliamentary elections with the authorities thus having a narrow margin of appreciation and the person concerned rm was a wellknown highranking government official the head of the presidential administration given that rm was a public figure the limits on acceptable criticism of him were widerβ as to the content and form of the impugned statements the court notes that the majority of the impugned statements see the summary in paragraph above set out in the article in question mentioned specific dates persons and incidents the court considers them assertions of facts statements of factual nature contrary to the applicants assertion that they were all value judgments some other statements which were strongly charged with the authors subjective feelings and emotions such as those claiming that rm had displayed animosity against bv could be regarded as value judgmentsγ as to the way in which the information was obtained and its veracity the court observes that the first applicant failed to submit to the domestic courts or the court any evidence demonstrating a factual basis for the impugned statements the court takes note of the fact that the first applicant as a media outlet can claim to be vested with a public watchdog function reporting on issues of high public interest however the first applicant was bound by the article duties and responsibilities and therefore had to act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism the court does not accept the first applicants argument that the impugned statements were not susceptible of proof as has already been noted see paragraph above the majority of the impugned statements constituted assertions of fact and therefore the first applicant had to demonstrate that it had taken care to verify them and ensure that they were true furthermore in respect of those statements which amounted to value judgments the first applicant had to provide a sufficient factual basis during the domestic court proceedings the first applicant was afforded a realistic chance of demonstrating the efforts it had made if any to check the veracity of the impugned allegations constituting assertions of fact and presenting adequate supporting facts for the value judgments set out in the impugned article nevertheless the first applicant did not even attempt to present any evidence in support of the impugned statements as it could have for example by asking the domestic courts to summon and question am or other individuals nor did the first applicant argue that its failure to present evidence had been due to its need to keep its journalistic sources secret the court does not accept the first applicants argument that the article in question merely reproduced and commented on information which had been published earlier in gundam khabar newspaper namely in an article called mafia and the press the impugned statements can not be regarded as a quotation from the latter article the article published in gundam khabar did not concern am bv or the parliamentary elections in sheki and it claimed that rm had interfered with the parliamentary elections in baku compare extracts in paragraphs i and above furthermore the first applicant has never argued let alone demonstrated that the abovementioned or the other impugned allegations stemmed from interviews with specific people such as for example am it appears that all the impugned statements apart from the allegation that rm had taken the initiative of annulling bvs mandate as an mp emanated from the author of the article in question himself see extracts in paragraph i ii and iv above or constituted unsubstantiated rumours which were presented to the reader as reliable information see extract in paragraph iii above consequently it can not be held that the first applicant was merely reporting what others had said about rm and simply omitted to distance itself in view of the foregoing considerations the court concludes that the first applicant failed in its duties and responsibilities under article of the convention and failed to show that prior to the publication it had acted in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable informationδ as to the nature and severity of the penalty imposed the first applicant argued before the court that the penalty imposed on it namely the order to pay nonpecuniary damages had been so severe that it had led to its closure the court notes in that regard that the domestic courts found the first applicant liable in civil defamation proceedings and ordered it inter alia to pay azerbaijani manats azn for nonpecuniary damage which at the material time was equivalent to approximately euros eur from the material submitted to the court it is clear that the first applicant never complained of the severity of the award before the domestic courts nor apparently did the first applicant contest the measures taken to enforce the award see paragraph above the first applicant submitted no documents either to the domestic courts or to the court detailing its financial situation at the material time in addition the available information concerning the consequences of the penalty for the first applicant is contradictory thus on the one hand it appears that after the measures taken to enforce the award khural ceased publication in paper version according to the first applicant that was caused by the harsh penalty imposed on it on the other hand it appears that its internet version wwwxuralcom has remained active and continued publishing articles both at the material time and well beyond in fact it appears that the website of the newspaper has never ceased operations furthermore according to an article published on its website the failure to publish a paper version of khural had been due to the refusal of the publishing houses and the first applicants staff attempted to publish a newspaper under a different name see paragraphs above consequently the court can not conclude that the award made against the first applicant had undermined its economic foundations and led to its closure as it claimed the court observes that the sanction obviously had to have negative consequences for the first applicant nevertheless the first applicant in the present case failed to demonstrate that the penalty imposed on it had been disproportionateiii conclusion in view of the considerations laid out in paragraph above the court is not satisfied that the domestic courts performed the required balancing exercise between the two competing rights in the present case the right to reputation and the right to freedom of expression having therefore had to assess the relevant facts itself see in particular paragraphs and above the court concludes that the interference with the first applicants right to freedom of expression can not be said to have fallen short of the requirements of necessity in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention the court would stress that the latter conclusion must be seen in the light of the particular circumstances of the present case due regard being had to the need to avoid any impairment of the medias watchdog role accordingly there was no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimouslydeclares the complaint under article of the convention introduced by the first applicant admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on october pursuant to rule and of the rules of court victor soloveytchik síofra oleary registrar president,,,
4,the applicant was born in and lives in warsaw a press publications and the press conference at the relevant time the applicant was a member of the polish parliament in october a series of reports appeared in the polish press in which the applicants past was described it was reported that the applicant had sexually abused students when working as a teacher in the s the reports in question were published in the polish daily newspapers super express on october and rzeczpospolita and gazeta wyborcza on october on the internet portal wydarzeniapl on october and by the information radio agency on october and the polish press agency on and october on october the applicant organised a press conference which was held in the sejm building the conference was transmitted by a tv news information channel tvn at the press conference the applicant said of course this was connected with the blackmail to which we were subjected we already know which journalists cooperated and with whom in order to obtain money from us under false pretences today this is almost one hundred per cent clear to us i think that today those three gentlemen already know about that those journalists cooperated with the informer who supplied the information on the basis of which the whole matter was disseminated and today as far as we know they are being paid for that i do not yet know how much some or of the amount obtained following this statement a journalist from the daily super express jh commented i am the author of this article jh from super express my question concerns the people who inspired me maybe you could tell us something else about these familialfinancial relationships the applicant replied i will reply to you the first complaint will be lodged against you with the court tomorrow after that three more complaints will be lodged on october the rzeczpospolita daily published an article entitled jan bestry i did not commit rape i will sue super express according to this article the super express daily had written that in the s the applicants employment contract had been terminated without notice because he had sexually abused young girls the article went on to say that a few days after publication of this story the tv station tvn reported that the applicant had been convicted in of having assaulted a woman passenger on a train when working as a train conductor the article also mentioned that during an interview with rzeczpospolita the applicant had said the disclosure of these matters is in effect a plot in which super express was involved the author of the article was gp who wrote it after interviewing the applicant on the phone according to gp the applicant approved publication of the contents of the article and the statements cited in the article were the statements made by the applicant however the applicant denied having spoken to gp or having approved any information for publication in the press article when questioned by the court he said that he had not attempted to have a correction of this article published because he had only found out about it in the course of the judicial proceedings see paragraph below b civil proceedings against the applicant on december the former editorinchief of the super express daily tl and the publisher of the newspaper the company media express sp z oo lodged a civil claim against the applicant for the protection of their personal rights they claimed that the applicant had harmed their good name and credibility by statements he had made at the press conference on october and in the article published by rzeczpospolita on october on may the warsaw regional court granted the claim in part and ordered the applicant to publish an apology for the statements he had made and which were cited in the article published by rzeczpospolita on october using the following wording jan bestry apologises to tl the former editorinchief of the super express daily for unlawful infringement of his personal rights namely his good name and professional credibility by alleging in the rzeczpospolita daily in an article published in issue no dated october november under the headline jan bestry i did not commit rape i will sue super express that the disclosure of the matters referred to in the article is in effect a plot in which super express was involved the applicant was also ordered to make a similar statement of apology as regards the plaintiff company media express sp z oo and to publish these two statements in a particular way on page four of rzeczpospolita the court refused to grant the plaintiffs request that the apology also be published in five other dailies and on the tvn channel finding that such an order would exceed the severity of the infringement committed by the applicant the court justified its reasoning by finding that the applicants statement referring to a plot in which the super express daily was involved infringed the plaintiffs personal rights and at the same time the applicant had not in any way proved the veracity of his allegations both at the time the article was published and later in the course of the civil proceedings he had failed to demonstrate that the newspaper had in fact been involved in any plot the court concluded that the applicants statements which had been made in public amounted to unverified suspicions and accusations addressed to the newspaper it further observed that the applicant as member of the parliament had a right to criticise socially negative phenomena guaranteed to him by the polish constitution and by article of the european convention on human rights however while enjoying this right he may not overstep the limits of permissible criticism by spreading groundless accusations the court did not find credible the applicants submission at the hearing on may that he had only found out about the rzeczpospolita article in the course of the proceedings the court took the view that having held a press conference the applicant would surely have followed the press articles which appeared over the following days concerning the subject matter discussed at the conference the court dismissed the remainder of the claim finding that the statements made by the applicant at the press conference on october could not unambiguously be interpreted as concerning journalists from a specific newspaper because the applicant had not expressly mentioned any journalist or newspaper by name both parties appealed against the firstinstance judgment on february the warsaw court of appeal amended the challenged judgment insofar as it additionally ordered the applicant to publish an apology for the statements made during the press conference on october the court examined what was said in the course of the conference and found that the applicant had initially referred to the events of s and to his work at the school and in the railway company he had also said everything which was written in super express is untrue next the applicant had spoken about his feelings about the case and about the sources that lay behind the story reported by the journalists involved in this case he stated that the first bill of indictment will be lodged with the court against the tabloids editor tomorrow before the end of the week three more complaints will be lodged all complaints concern articles in the newspaper discussed after further statements referring to events at the school where the applicant had worked and a statement by the applicants wife the applicant made the statement referred to above see paragraphs and which in turn provoked the reaction by jh see paragraph above the court of appeal concluded that although the applicant had not specifically mentioned the names of any journalists or newspapers for the average person it was clear from the context of the statements concerned that the charges of blackmail and obtaining money under false pretences had been directed at journalists from super express the court additionally ordered the applicant to publish the following apology on the tv channel tvn on a weekday between midday and pm jan bestry apologises to tl the former editorinchief of the super express daily for unlawful infringement of his personal rights namely his good name and professional credibility by making a statement at the press conference on october which contained the untrue and defamatory allegation that super express journalists had cooperated with informers in order to obtain money from jan bestry under false pretences and when publishing articles about jan bestry in super express had received a percentage of the money obtained under false pretences jan bestry expresses his regret for having illegally infringed the personal rights of the former editorinchief tl the applicant was also ordered to publish in the same medium an identical apology regarding the company media express sp z oo the applicant lodged a cassation appeal on april the supreme court refused to examine the appeal holding that the applicant had not demonstrated that the court of appeal had overstepped the limits regarding the assessment of evidence or had infringed the rules of interpretation of the relevant provisions c criminal proceedings against the applicant jh lodged a private bill of indictment against the applicant he claimed that on october the applicant had slandered him through the mass media at a press conference by making public allegations that he had cooperated with informers in order to obtain money from the applicant he also requested that the applicant be found guilty of slandering him by giving an interview to the rzeczpospolita daily in which he had alleged that jh had participated in a plot against him on april the warsaw district court found the applicant guilty of two counts of slander and sentenced him to a fine the applicant did not appeal against this judgment d criminal proceedings against jh the applicant in turn also lodged a private bill of indictment against jh he sought a criminal conviction for jh on two counts of slander firstly for having published an article alleging that the applicant had sexually abused children and secondly for having published on october another article under the title woman assaulted by bestry he wanted to force her into submission he was convicted for beating her up on october the warsaw regional court acquitted jh on the first count of slander but found him guilty on the second count the applicants lawyer and jhs lawyer both lodged appeals against this judgment on july the warsaw regional court amended the firstinstance judgment in that it also acquitted jh also of the second count of slander finding that he had not committed an offence because he had merely made public truthful information concerning a person exercising a public function the court found that jh had collected sufficient evidence to prove the veracity of the information he had published and therefore could not be found guilty of slander the court admitted that as regards the second count of slander jh had published information about a criminal conviction which due to the passage of time had already been removed from the applicants criminal record however it considered that the expunging of the applicants record had concerned only its criminal and not its civil aspects and that the disclosure of the expunged conviction was permissible if made for the purposes of protecting a socially protected interest the applicant lodged a cassation appeal on march the supreme court declined to examine the appeal holding it to be unfounded ii relevant domestic lawpersonal rights and their protection under the civil code article of the civil code contains a nonexhaustive list of rights known as personal rights dobra osobiste this provision states the personal rights of an individual such as his or her health liberty reputation cześć freedom of conscience name or pseudonym and image the secrecy of his or her correspondence the inviolability of his or her home his or her scientific or artistic work and inventions and improvements shall be protected under civil law regardless of the protection laid down in other legal provisions article of the civil code provides for ways of redressing infringements of personal rights under that provision a person faced with the threat of an infringement may demand that the prospective perpetrator refrain from the wrongful activity unless it is not unlawful where an infringement has taken place the person affected may inter alia request that the wrongdoer make a relevant statement in an appropriate form or demand satisfaction from him or her if an infringement of a personal right causes any financial loss the person concerned may seek damages under article of the civil code an individual whose personal rights have been infringed may seek compensation that provision in its relevant part reads the court may grant a suitable sum by way of pecuniary compensation for nonpecuniary damage krzywda suffered by anyone whose personal rights have been infringed alternatively without prejudice to the right to seek any other relief that may be necessary to remove the consequences of the infringement the person concerned may ask the court to award a suitable sum for the benefit of a specific social interest the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant alleged a breach of article of the convention which reads everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartially of the judiciary a admissibility the government submitted that the applicant had failed to inform the court of the criminal proceedings against him and of the fact that he had been found guilty and convicted they further argued that the information not disclosed to the court leads to the conclusion that the present application is manifestly illfounded they also submitted that the applicant had failed to appeal against the judgment of april by which he had been convicted and therefore had not exhausted the domestic remedies the applicant submitted that the criminal proceedings referred to by the government did not constitute part of the subject matter of the present application his complaint concerned the civil proceedings by which he was found to have infringed personal rights of jh and the company media express sp z oo assuming that the governments submissions might be understood as a plea on inadmissibility on the grounds of an abuse of the right of individual application under article of the convention the court reiterates that an application may be rejected as abusive under article of the convention among other reasons if it was knowingly based on untrue facts see varbanov v bulgaria no echr x rehak v czech republic dec no may popov v moldova no no january and kérétchachvili v georgia dec no may incomplete and therefore misleading information may also amount to abuse of the right of application especially if the information concerns the very core of the case and no sufficient explanation is given for the failure to disclose that information see hüttner v germany dec no june poznanski and others v germany dec no july predescu v romania no december and kowal v poland dec no september in the present case the gist of the governments arguments does not actually concern untrue facts allegedly adduced by the applicant before the court the court notes that the applicant did not indeed inform the court about his criminal conviction even though it related to the same events which constitute a basis for the civil proceedings complained of it follows that the applicants criminal conviction does not constitute a part of the present application and as such can not be regarded as concerning the very core of the case the court is therefore of the view that it can not be said that the manner in which the applicant presented his case amounts to an abuse of the right of petition it also considers that since the criminal proceedings referred to by the government did not constitute a subject matter of the applicants complaint his application can not be declared inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remedies on the ground that he had failed to appeal against his criminal conviction the court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits arguments of the partiesa the applicant the applicant submitted that the interference with his freedom of expression had been in breach of article of the convention he argued that the domestic courts had failed to take into account that the impugned statements had been made as a form of defence against defamatory allegations contained in the press articles published before the conference he further submitted that at the press conference on october he had not mentioned any journalist by name or given the title of any newspaper therefore he should not have been ordered to apologise for the statements he had made there the applicant considered the domestic courts finding in this respect arbitrary he continued that by sanctioning him for making his statements the domestic courts had failed to strike a fair balance in weighing up his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the convention in this respect he considered that in the present case there had been no element of a pressing social need as regards the nature and severity of the sanction imposed the applicant submitted that the order to publish apologies in the press and on the tv channel entailed costs amounting to approximately polish zlotys pln approx euros eurb the government the government submitted that the allegations made by the applicant during the press conference amounted to statements of fact rather than to value judgments and that the applicant should therefore have proved the authenticity of the facts he referred to they stressed the domestic courts finding that the applicant had failed to prove the veracity of his allegations they also argued that from what was said during the press conference in question as examined by the domestic courts it appeared that the applicant had been referring to the newspaper super express and its journalists even though no particular person had been identified by name they further submitted that at the relevant time the applicant had been a public figure and the matter was therefore of general public concern however they considered that this could not justify making public untrue information infringing the personal rights of others the government concluded that the domestic courts had managed to strike a fair balance between the applicants freedom of expression and the need to protect the professional credibility of the press the domestic courts reaction was thus proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued consequently the government invited the court to find no violation of article of the convention in the present case the courts assessment it was not disputed that the courts decisions in the present case and the sanctions imposed on the applicant amounted to an interference with his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the convention such interference was undoubtedly prescribed by law namely under articles and of the civil code the court further accepts that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others namely tl the former editorinchief of the super express daily and the publishing company media express sp z oo within the meaning of article of the convention accordingly the only outstanding issue is whether the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression was necessary in a democratic societya the general principles according to the courts caselaw freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and is one of the basic preconditions for the development thereof and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of the pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society as set forth in article this freedom is subject to exceptions which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly see among many other authorities janowski v poland gc no echr i nilsen and johnsen v norway gc no echr viii the test of necessity in a democratic society requires the court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those delivered by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to deliver the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article see among many other authorities perna v italy gc no echr v and cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no echr xi the courts task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the competent domestic courts but rather to review under article the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation see fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether or not the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully or in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole including the content of the comments held against the applicant and the context in which he made them see news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i in particular the court must determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify the interference were relevant and sufficient and whether the measures taken were proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued see chauvy and others v france no echr vi in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities basing themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article see among many other authorities zana v turkey judgment of november reports of judgments and decisions vii pp in addition the fairness of the proceedings the procedural guarantees afforded see mutatis mutandis steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr and the nature and severity of the penalties imposed see ceylan v turkey gc no echr iv and skałka v poland no may are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see kyprianou v cyprus gc no echr furthermore the court reiterates that in its practice it has distinguished between statements of fact and value judgements while the existence of facts can be demonstrated the truth of value judgements is not susceptible of proof where a statement amounts to a value judgement the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement since even a value judgement without any factual basis to support it may be excessive see de haes and gijsels v belgium judgment of february reports i p and feldek v slovakia no echr viii the court further observes that there is little scope under article of the convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate concerning questions of public interest see sürek v turkey no gc no echr ivb application of the above principles to the present case in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction the court must look at the impugned interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression in the light of the case as a whole including the content of the statements concerned the context in which they were made and also the particular circumstances of those involved in the instant case the press conference organised by the applicant on october was his reply to a series of articles published earlier in october alleging that he had sexually abused students when working as a teacher see paragraphs and above moreover the statements he made in the rzeczpospolita daily of october november were his comments in response to allegations broadcast on the tvn television channel that he had been convicted in the past for having assaulted a woman see paragraph above the court therefore accepts that the applicant was defending himself against allegations published in the media in which he was accused of having committed criminal offences the court notes further that in statements made at the press conference and also published in rzeczpospolita the applicant referred to a plot and accused the journalists of taking part in blackmail and writing defamatory articles for money see paragraphs and above the firstinstance court made a distinction between the press conference and the rzeczpospolita article and found that an infringement of the plaintiffs personal rights could be attributable to the applicant only as regards the allegations he made in rzeczpospolita the secondinstance court however having examined what was said during the press conference and assessed the applicants allegations in the light of statements he made earlier at the same conference considered that the statements made at the press conference had also infringed the plaintiffs personal rights see paragraphs and above as regards the categorisation of the applicants statements the court observes that the polish courts classified them as statements of fact rather than value judgments and accepts this classification indeed the allegations that there was blackmail which we were subjected to today we already know which journalists cooperated and with whom in order to obtain money from us under false pretences or those journalists cooperated with the informer who supplied the information on the basis of which the whole matter was disseminated and today they are being paid for that do amount to statements of fact which are susceptible of proof in this respect the court notes that the domestic courts examined the circumstances of the case and found that the applicant had failed to prove the veracity of his assertions either at the time of their publication or thereafter in the course of the civil proceedings moreover he was not table to provide any evidence in support of his statements see paragraph above the court further notes that the domestic courts recognised the applicants right to freedom of expression however they found that this freedom could not overstep the limits of permissible criticism and did not permit the making of unfounded public statements infringing the personal rights of others see paragraph above the court considers that the domestic courts thereby recognised that the present case involved a conflict between the right to freedom of expression and the protection of the reputation and rights of others and thus carried out the appropriate balancing exercise see mutatis mutandis keller v hungary dec no april cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania cited above von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr and axel springer ag v germany gc no february having regard to the above and to the nature of the statements made by the applicant the court sees no reason to depart from the domestic courts finding that the applicant lacked a sufficient factual basis for the allegation that the newspaper super express and its former editorinchief had been involved in a plot against him and had prepared defamatory articles in return for money from their informers the national authorities were thus entitled to take the view that there was a pressing social need to take action under the applicable law in relation to that allegation as regards the fairness of the proceedings and the procedural guarantees afforded the court notes that there is nothing in the casefile which would suggest that the rules governing a fair trial were not respected in the present case the applicant was questioned in person at a hearing and in particular had a chance to defend himself and to present evidence in support of his allegations see paragraph above his case was examined on the merits by courts at two instances and their judgments contain exhaustive and meticulous explanations setting out the reasoning behind their decisions the court reiterates that the nature and severity of the sanction imposed are also factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference under article of the convention see paragraph above in the instant case the applicant was sued before the civil courts and ordered to publish apologies addressed to both plaintiffs in the rzeczpospolita daily and on the tvn television channel the court admit that publication of apologies on a tv channel must have entailed considerable costs for the applicant see paragraph above it notes however that the domestic courts directed that the apologies should be published in the same mass media in which the defamatory statements had been made by the applicant see paragraph above and that the regional court dismissed a further request from the plaintiffs that the apologies be published in several other press titles see paragraph above it follows that the publication order corresponded to the scope of the publication of the defamatory statements and that the burden imposed on the applicant was mitigated by the second instance court the court considers therefore that the manner of publication of the apologies did not exceed the margin of discretion accorded to the domestic courts having regard to the foregoing the court considers that the domestic courts finding against the applicant and the sanctions imposed on him were not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and that the reasons provided by the domestic courts justifying those measures were relevant and sufficient the interference with the applicants exercise of his right to freedom of expression could therefore reasonably be regarded by the national authorities as necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation and rights of others it follows that there has been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the complaint under article of the convention admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of

5,in and lives in berlin the applicant was represented by mr c partsch a lawyer practising in berlin the government were represented by represented by two of their agents mr hj behrens and ms k behr of the federal ministry of justice and consumer protection the facts of the case may be summarised as follows administrative proceedings by letter of january the applicant requested the foreign intelligence service to allow him to get physical access and to consult in person the files akteneinsicht as well as to make copies of the documents it held regarding several prominent persons among whom mr ub a former prime minister of the land of schleswig holstein who had died during the night of to october in the beau rivage hotel in geneva switzerland the applicant specified that he was interested in particular in the services findings and investigations regarding the circumstances of ubs death and rumours that ub had collaborated with the intelligence service of an eastern european country and that he had been blackmailed by such service he relied on section subsection in conjunction with section subsection of the act on the use and preservation of federal archival documents gesetz über die nutzung und sicherung von archivgut des bundes bundesarchivgesetz hereinafter federal archives act see paragraph below on article of the basic law and on caselaw of the federal administrative court the applicant did not explain why he needed physical access to the said files on december the foreign intelligence service denied the applicants request the requirements under the federal archives act were not met the documents did not date from more than thirty years ago and filing the documents with the federal archives for the purposes of shortening the period during which the information was classified was not possible as the service still needed the files concerned on march the foreign intelligence service rejected the applicants administrative appeal widerspruch insofar as it concerned the consultation of the files in person the appeal was illfounded insofar as he sought to rely on section subsection in conjunction with section subsection of the federal archives act the files were held by the foreign intelligence service not by the federal archives and only files older than thirty years that were held by the service could be consulted in accordance with these provisions this requirement was not met as the files at issue relating to ub dated from to the provisions concerning a shortening of the period of closure schutzfrist concerned files that were held by the federal archives themselves as well as files which continued to be subject to closure even after the expiry of the thirtyyear period the appeal was inadmissible insofar as the applicant sought to rely on article of the basic law in order to be allowed to consult the files in person given that no refusal decision on this request which could form the subject of the appeal had been taken yet in this connection the service considered in the applicants favour that the development in the caselaw of the federal administrative court which had found by a leading judgment of february for the first time there to be a right of the press to receive information to be derived directly from article second sentence of the basic law verfassungsunmittelbarer auskunftsanspruch see paragraph below was to be taken into account however that right was limited to receiving information auskunftserteilung and did not encompass a right to consult files in person at the same time the foreign intelligence stated that the applicants request to receive information under article of the basic law was still being processed within the foreign intelligence service it being noted that the federal administrative courts judgment of february had been delivered only very recently and that it was not yet available to the service in writing the service stated that it would separately inform the applicant about its decision on his request to receive information proceedings before the federal administrative court on april the applicant lodged an action with the federal administrative court claiming that he was entitled to consult the files in person the applicant submitted that the thirtyyear period of closure provided for by the federal archives act aimed at striking a balance between the freedom of information and privacy in the light of the comprehensive publications on the death of ub a prominent politician and continuing suspicions that he was murdered and that this murder was covered up by the german authorities considerations relating to ubs privacy were clearly outweighed by the interests of the press and the public in the information concerning the circumstances of his death taking into account the role of the press as a public watchdog and the paramount public interest in the information the thirtyyear period of closure was to be shortened in the present case the applicant added that he was also entitled to consult the files in person on the basis of article first sentence of the basic law article second sentence of the basic law and article of the basic law see paragraph below he emphasised that the right of the press to receive information may take the form of a right to consult files in person the respondent acknowledged inter alia that the right of the press to receive information from federal agencies which derived directly from article second sentence of the basic law may exceptionally consolidate sich verdichten to become a right to consult files in person however the applicant had not made a substantiated submission in this respect neither in the administrative proceedings nor before the federal administrative court and no grounds could be discerned for concluding that this exception applied in the present case in particular there were no grounds for concluding that the obligation to give access to the information in a complete and truthful manner could only be achieved by way of allowing the applicant to consult the files in person in his reply the applicant submitted in respect of the right of the press to receive information under article second sentence of the basic law that in view of the voluminous scope of the files at issue access to the information in a complete and appropriate manner could only be ensured by allowing him to consult the files in person by judgment of november the federal administrative court rejected the applicants action it found that the applicant could not rely on the federal archives act he could not rely on its section subsection directly because the said files were not archived within the meaning of that provision as they continued to be with the foreign intelligence service not the federal archives section subsection taken in conjunction with section subsection of the federal archives act only applied to files thirty years or older which was not the case here the foreign intelligence service had credibly substantiated that its files on ub were less old and the applicant had not disputed this as the wording of section subsection of the federal archives act was unequivocal and not open to any interpretation it was not possible to shorten that period and subsection in particular did not apply to the thirtyyear period stipulated by subsection the federal administrative court went on to find that the applicant did not have a right to consult in person the files at issue under article first sentence of the basic law the right to information informationsfreiheit guaranteed by that provision did not apply as the files at issue were not publicly available sources allgemein zugängliche quellen this right did not entail having information held by the authorities made publicly available the federal administrative court held that the applicant did not have a right to consult in person the files under article second sentence of the basic law either referring to its leading judgment of february in other proceedings see paragraphs above and below the court reiterated that a right of the press to receive information derived from article second sentence of the basic law directly this right reflected a minimum standard which the legislature which had a wide margin of appreciation and the exclusive prerogative to adopt rules that may accord more weight to one or other of the competing interests must not fall short of it met its limit where the press interest in receiving information was opposed by legitimate interests of individuals or authorities the scope of that right did in general encompass neither consulting in person files held by authorities nor making copies of such files umfasst grundsätzlich nicht eine aktennutzung durch einsichtnahme in behördenakten oder eine kopie von behördenakten lastly the federal administrative court found that the applicant did not have a right to consult the files in person under article of the basic law no right of the applicant to have his research work supported by being allowed to consult files in person could be derived from that provision the judgment was served on the applicants counsel on january disclosure of information outside the scope of the proceedings outside the scope of the proceedings at issue the applicant on september four months after he had lodged his action with the federal administrative court see paragraph above relying on the right of the press to receive information presserechtlicher auskunftsanspruch under article second sentence of the basic law requested the foreign intelligence service to disclose information to him on the scope of the foreign intelligence services files on ub the reason for their creation and their content on november the day of the oral hearing before the federal administrative court the applicant and the foreign intelligence service reached an agreement in respect of the request of september concluding that it be met outside the scope of the proceedings at issue by letter of december the foreign intelligence service provided the applicant with a summary of the declassified information of the foreign intelligence service regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of ub the letter stated that the service had never been charged with investigating the circumstances of the death of ub it had received certain indications from different sources and transmitted these without delay to the competent investigative authorities some pages of the files held by the service had been identified so far as having at least a vague connection to the circumstances of ubs death the vast majority of the documents concerned a review of press articles inquiries made towards the service correspondence with the competent investigative authority and speaking notes for parliament the letter listed twelve indications received by the foreign intelligence service from november onwards all but one of these indications had been transmitted to the competent public prosecutors office the person who had given the one indication which was not transmitted had been contacted by the prosecution authorities several times already at the applicants subsequent request the foreign intelligence service on february provided the applicant with information regarding the dates of transmission of the said indications to the competent public prosecutors office the proceedings before the federal constitutional court on february the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint the applicant argued that the federal administrative court had not sufficiently taken his fundamental rights guaranteed by article first and second sentence and article of the basic law into account when interpreting the provisions of the federal archives act see paragraphs and above he further referred to this courts caselaw on the right of access to information under article of the convention emphasising the role of the press as a public watchdog the applicant moreover alleged that the federal administrative court had breached his right to be heard by ignoring his submission that it was not credible that the foreign intelligence services documents relating to ub dated from onwards given that ub had died in the applicant did not raise further arguments before the federal constitutional court nor did he mention in his constitutional complaint that information on the scope and content of the files held by the foreign intelligence service on ub had been disclosed to him in the meantime see paragraph above on september the federal constitutional court declined to consider the applicants constitutional complaint for adjudication without providing reasons no bv r the decision was served on the applicants counsel on september the applicants subsequent publications on february the applicant published an article in bild in which he reproduced some of the information disclosed to him by the foreign intelligence services letters of december and february on july the applicant published another article in bild stating that the foreign intelligence service held pages of files on ub which were kept confidential thus far and were meant to be kept secret after the lapse of a thirtyyear period relevant legal framework and practice article of the basic law grundgesetz reads as follows article every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech writing and pictures and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources

in force at the material time provided insofar as relevant as follows section everyone is entitled to access to official information from the authorities of the federal government in accordance with the provisions of this act the authority may furnish information grant access to files or provide information in any other manner where an applicant requests a certain form of access to information the information may only be provided by other means for good cause in particular substantially higher administrative expenditure shall constitute good cause section the entitlement to access to information shall not apply with regard to the intelligence services and the authorities and other public bodies of the federal government where these perform duties pursuant to section no of the security clearance check act german land press legislation landespressegesetze provides for a right of members of the press to receive information under certain circumstances according to the caselaw of the domestic courts this results in an entitlement of the press to obtain disclosure of the contents of the information available to the authority concerned the right of the press to receive information does not as a rule encompass the right of the press to consult the files in person however the right of the press to receive information may exceptionally consolidate to become a right to consult files if access to information in a complete and truthful manner can only be achieved that way see cottbus administrative court no l order of january dresden administrative court no l order of may at para juris in a case in which the press sought to obtain a copy of written declarations by a prime minister of a land concerning his past in the former german democratic republic which were in his personnel file the competent administrative court ordered the authority concerned to disclose the content of the said declarations see dresden administrative court order of may cited above at the same time the court found that there were no grounds for finding that the applicants right to receive the said information had consolidated to become a right to consult the personnel files to which obtaining a copy of the impugned documents was akin see ibid at para the applicants had not substantiated why the requested information could only be provided in a complete and truthful manner by way of allowing them to consult the files idem in its leading judgment of february no a the federal administrative court found that land press legislation was not applicable to the foreign intelligence service because pursuant to the basic law the federal legislature had exclusive competence for matters relating to that service including the circumstances in which it had to or may disclose information to the public and the press the federal legislature had not yet adopted a provision on the matter notably the provisions governing access to information and related restrictions in the freedom of information act see paragraph above did not correspond to the specific needs and role of the press instead the federal administrative court found for the first time a right of the press to receive information to derive directly from article second sentence of the basic law see also saure v germany dec no october in adjudicating a constitutional complaint against that judgment of the federal administrative court the federal constitutional court no bv r order of july considered that there were no indications of a violation of the right of freedom of the press as long as the specialised courts granted members of the press a right to receive information in relation to federal authorities which in substance did not fall short of the content of the right to receive information under land press legislation see also saure cited above the federal administrative court subsequently also held that the right of the press to receive information deriving from article second sentence of the basic law directly must in substance not fall short of the content of the right to receive information under land press legislation see federal administrative court no c

at the material time provided insofar as relevant as follows section the constitutional organs authorities and courts at the level of the federation the bodies corporate under public law institutions

constitutional complaint shall be lodged and substantiated within one month with the timelimit commencing with the service or informal notification of the complete decision the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention about the refusal to allow him to get physical access and to consult in person the files held by foreign intelligence service on ub a former prime minister of the land of schleswig holstein who had died in a hotel in geneva switzerland in article of the convention insofar as relevant reads as follows article everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the parties submissionsa government the government submitted that the complaint was inadmissible on several grounds it was incompatible ratione materiae with article of the convention the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedies and in any event the complaint was illfounded given that information on the content of the foreign intelligence services files was disclosed to the applicant the present application boiled down to the question whether the german authorities were obliged in addition to providing access to information by way of disclosure following an agreement reached outside the proceedings at issue to also provide access to the same information through another means that is by allowing in addition the applicant to consult the files in person the government asserted that there was no obligation under article of the convention to that effect as the courts caselaw provided that there was no obligation on the state to provide information in a specific form they referred to weber v germany dec no january and consequently no interference with the applicants article rights the applicant had furthermore failed to elaborate on his intended publication before the domestic courts despite being required to do so and had thus prevented these from assessing whether the publication would address a subject of general importance or only an audiences wish for sensationalism or even voyeurism that is to say whether the public interest test was satisfied they referred to magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no november as regards nonexhaustion of domestic remedies the government submitted that the federal administrative court had examined the applicants request under two separate legal bases which were independent of each other the federal archives act and the right of the press to receive information under article second sentence of the basic law and it had advanced different reasons for rejecting the applicants action in respect of those two claims in his constitutional complaint however the applicant had exclusively complained about the interpretation of provisions of the federal archives act the present application before the court was inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remedies since he advanced with the exception of certain submissions concerning the federal archives act entirely different arguments before the court they referred to hoffmann v germany dec no november and weiss v germany dec committee no august the applicants claim under article second sentence of the basic law was rejected by the federal administrative court because of a lack of substantiation why allowing him to consult the files in person was the only means to satisfy his information request moreover he had not challenged the federal administrative courts finding in respect of that provision in his constitutional complaint the applicant moreover failed to exhaust domestic remedies in respect of a number of submissions which he made for the first time before the court notably on his intended publication and the purpose of his information request certain alleged errors in the application of the federal archives act as well as the claim that the foreign intelligence service was obliged to hand the files over to the federal archives in his constitutional complaint the applicant had also not made any submissions about the disclosure of information about the content and scope of the files held by the foreign intelligence service on ub even though the first of the two disclosures occurred prior to the service of the federal administrative courts judgment and the timelimit for amending his constitutional complaint was still running at the time of the latter of the two disclosures in their additional observations and submissions on just satisfaction the government suggested that the court review whether or not the application ought to be declared inadmissible for abuse of the right of individual application pursuant to article a of the convention as a whole or in part in view of the applicants failure to mention the disclosure of the information on the scope and content of files in his application to the court shortly before lodging the present application the applicant had published an article based on the information thus received which he had also failed to mention in his application the applicant had created a fundamentally misleading impression of the facts of the case by concealing the nature and the scope of the information disclosed to him and the use he had made of itb the applicant the applicant rejected the governments submission that he intended to obtain information which he had already received but only through different means the information he had received in december and february could not replace a consultation of the files in person without being allowed to consult in person the files at issue he a wellknown journalist who had previously published on german history was unable to perform his role as a public watchdog he was hindered to adequately inform the public and to contribute to a debate of paramount public interest that is to say on the question whether ub a highranking german politician had committed suicide or had been murdered he argued that he had sufficiently substantiated his request before the domestic courts it was irrelevant that he had not elaborated in the domestic proceedings on the purpose of his information request nor on an intended publication the courts assessmenta abuse of the right of application the court reiterates that a failure on the part of an applicant to inform it at the outset of a fact essential for the examination of the case could in principle lead to the application being declared inadmissible for abuse of the right of application within the meaning of article a of the convention in order for the court to reach such a conclusion the misleading information should concern the very core of the case moreover an intention to mislead the court must always be established with sufficient certainty see belošević v croatia dec no december with further references some of the applicants initial submissions notably that he had effectively been denied access to the information that withholding information on which the authorities had a monopoly amounted to censorship and that he was unable to research or report on the topic created the impression that he had not received any information given that the applicant had in fact received information on the scope of the foreign intelligence services files on ub the reason for their creation and their content following an agreement he had reached with the authorities in parallel to the proceedings leading to the present application see paragraph above the applicant had indeed concealed important information and created a misleading impression of the facts of the case while the applicants conduct is at least deplorable having regard to the applicants submissions that the information he had received could not replace a consultation of the files in person as the two types of access to information did not yield the same information in terms of quality and quantity the court considers that it can not be established with sufficient certainty that he intended to mislead the court therefore the court concludes that the applicants failure to inform the court about the information disclosed to him in respect of the foreign intelligence services files on ub did not amount to an abuse of the right of application within the meaning of article a of the conventionb nonexhaustion of domestic remedies the court reiterates that the purpose of the exhaustion rule is to afford a contracting state the opportunity of addressing and thereby preventing or putting right the particular convention violation alleged against it it is true that under the courts caselaw it is not always necessary for the convention to be explicitly raised in domestic proceedings provided that the complaint is raised at least in substance this means that the applicant must raise legal arguments to the same or like effect on the basis of domestic law in order to give the national courts the opportunity to redress the alleged breach however as the courts caselaw bears out to genuinely afford a contracting state the opportunity of preventing or redressing the alleged violation requires taking into account not only the facts but also the applicants legal arguments for the purposes of determining whether the complaint submitted to the court has indeed been raised beforehand in substance before the domestic authorities that is because it would be contrary to the subsidiary character of the convention machinery if an applicant ignoring a possible convention argument could rely on some other ground before the national authorities for challenging an impugned measure but then lodge an application before the court on the basis of the convention argument see among other authorities hanan v germany gc no february throughout the domestic proceedings the applicant consistently requested that he be allowed to consult in person the files on ub held by the foreign intelligence service initially relying exclusively on domestic law and subsequently referring to the courts caselaw on article of the convention as well the court considers that he raised the article complaint which he raised before the court at least in substance before the domestic courts and thus exhausted domestic remedies as required by article of the convention in respect of his convention complaintc applicability of article of the convention having regard to the governments objection as to the applicability of article of the convention the court reiterates that article of the convention does not confer in general and absolute terms on the individual a right of access to information held by a public authority nor oblige the government to impart such information to the individual however such a right or obligation may arise firstly where disclosure of the information has been imposed by a judicial order which has gained legal force and secondly in circumstances where access to the information is instrumental for the individuals exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression in particular the freedom to receive and impart information and where its denial constitutes an interference with that right magyar helsinki bizottság cited above the court notes that the government did not contest the applicants right of access to information on the foreign intelligence services files on ub as such they argued that it did not constitute an interference with the applicants article rights that the german authorities refused to grant him physical access to the impugned files in addition to having provided him information on the scope and content of those files see paragraph above in these particular circumstances the question whether the desired physical access to the impugned files was instrumental for the applicants exercise of his right to freedom of expression and hence the question of the applicability of article of the convention is closely linked to the merits of the complaint therefore the court exceptionally decides to examine the question of the applicability of article of the convention together with that pertaining to the existence of interference under this provision on the merits of the present case see studio monitori and others v georgia nos and january and centre for democracy and the rule of law v ukraine no march it therefore decides to join the objection to the meritsd conclusion the court further observes that the applicants complaint under article of the convention is neither manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention nor inadmissible on any other grounds the complaint must therefore be declared admissible merits the parties submissionsa the applicant the applicant asserted that there had been an unjustified interference with his rights under article of the convention without being allowed to consult in person the files at issue he a wellknown journalist who had previously published on german history was unable to perform his role as a public watchdog he was hindered to adequately inform the public and to contribute to a debate of paramount public interest that is to say on the question whether ub a highranking german politician had committed suicide or had been murdered the death had led to numerous publications and press coverage had played a vital part in starting a public debate the applicant submitted that based on the available information it was probable that ub had been murdered which led to the question why the respondent authority was unwilling to show what it knew about the circumstances of the death the matter involved questions of the integrity of public officials and institutions finding out who was responsible for the possible murder of a highranking politician a possible participation of the authorities in it including a possible complicity of the foreign intelligence service and a cover up by government institutions it was irrelevant that he had not elaborated in the domestic proceedings on the purpose of his information request nor on an intended publication a member of the press did not have to reveal this as there may otherwise be a risk of abuse on part of the authority from which access to information was requested thus far he was only doing research on circumstances of ubs death and had not decided whether he wanted to publish on the matter a journalists mere interest in being able to do research on a matter was sufficient to oblige an authority to grant access to such information since the authorities had a monopoly on the information concerned the applicant could neither do research nor report on the topic withholding the information thus amounted to censorship there were two steps in the assessment firstly whether information was to be disclosed to the press and secondly whether the press may disclose the information to the public the information he had received in december and february could not replace a consultation of the files in person the two types of access to information at issue did not yield the same information in terms of quality and quantity given the volume of the files held by the service some pages it was obvious that the disclosure of information as to the files content was necessarily selective and incomplete only a fraction of the information would be revealed and there was a risk that the authority would provide onesided facts conceal embarrassing information and thus prevent the press from reporting on scandals and matters worth reporting in the case of voluminous records on matters of public interest the only appropriate means of giving access to information was to allow for the files to be consulted in person if the press were not allowed to consult voluminous files in person this would mean that the press would effectively be denied access to information on complex matters and could not report on these before the domestic courts he had invoked the volume of the files as the reason why he needed to consult the files in person he had not been required to substantiate this aspect in more detail the burden of proof was on the authorities the federal administrative court had not rejected his claim under article second sentence of the basic law due to a lack of substantiation but had stated that there was no right to consult files in person under that provision the applicant argued that the domestic authorities had failed to balance the competing interests when interpreting the provisions of the federal archives act and rejecting his claim on the sole ground that the thirtyyear period of closure had not lapsed in the present case the interests of the press outweighed those of the federal intelligence service not to give access to the files the only legitimate aim pursued by the service could be the protection of the reputation of the deceased person and of his personal data however these considerations could not justify thwarting an investigation into the circumstances of ubs death his heirs also had an interest in learning what had really happened the applicant submitted that the real reason for not allowing him to consult the files in person was that the foreign intelligence service was afraid of a scandal along these lines he added that it was not credible that the foreign intelligence services files on ub dated only from onwards in any event the service was obliged to offer the files to the federal archives since it never claimed that it still needed them if the service retained the files it was obliged to provide access in a similar manner as the federal archives that is to say by allowing him to consult the files in person as was the standard practice of the federal archives lastly the applicant submitted that the length of the domestic proceedings had gradually diminished the value of the requested information he did not have a domestic remedy at his disposal to speed up the proceedingsb the government the government emphasised that information on the content of the foreign intelligence services files which he had requested was disclosed to the applicant he was not denied access to the desired information and he did not argue that the information disclosed to him was incorrect or insufficient the government submitted that the present application boiled down to the question whether the german authorities were obliged in addition to providing access to information by way of disclosure following an agreement reached outside the proceedings at issue to also provide access to the same information through another means that is by allowing the applicant to consult the files in person they asserted that there was no obligation under article of the convention to that effect as the courts caselaw provided that there was no obligation on the state to provide information in a specific form they referred to weber cited above it was within the margin of appreciation accorded to the domestic authorities to refuse the consultation of files in person if access to the same information had already been given by way of disclosure of their content unless the person seeking the information substantiated why consulting the files in person was the only appropriate means to satisfy the information request such substantiation requirements for granting access to information in the specific form of allowing for the consultation of files in person did not constitute a disproportionate restriction that rendered such claim ineffective this general approach was even more pertinent in the present case and constituted an appropriate balancing of interests given that the files at issue were from the outset not destined for the public and inferences on the internal organisation and working methods of the foreign intelligence service could be drawn if the files were consulted in person in this connection they emphasised that the applicant had not put forward arguments why the information that had been disclosed to him was insufficient and had to be complemented by allowing him to consult the files nor had he explained why the form in which access to the information was given had a detrimental effect on his interest in obtaining information the federal administrative court which had rendered its judgment after the conclusion of the disclosure agreement had rejected the applicants claim based on article second sentence of the basic law because he had not substantiated why he needed to consult the files in person in addition to the disclosure of the information on the files content that court had not found that the right of the press to receive information under article second sentence of the basic law could never result in a right to consult files in person contrary to the applicants submission rather it had found that such right was in general not encompassed that is to say that the right of the press to receive information may exceptionally and subject to additional prerequisites consolidate to become a right to consult files as recognised in the caselaw of the domestic courts the applicant had not alleged before the federal constitutional court that he had been prevented from making a substantiated submission before the federal administrative court the government added that the authorities could not be said to have retained a monopoly on the information at issue as the applicant had received the information he had sought in fact he had published two articles based on the information thus received which he had failed to mention before the court against this background it was not in fact necessary for the applicants exercise of his right to freedom of expression that he also be allowed to consult the files in person they referred to magyar helsinki bizottság cited above given that the two articles were published in a newspaper with a large circulation two years after the disclosure of the information the applicants claim that the value of the information sought which in any event concerned a historical event had diminished due to the duration of the proceedings was not convincing moreover had the applicant not been satisfied with the information disclosed to him in december and february he could have requested additional information to be disclosed and challenged any refusal before the domestic courts the applicant had furthermore failed to elaborate on his intended publication before the domestic courts despite being required to do so and had thus prevented these from assessing whether the publication would address a subject of general importance or only an audiences wish for sensationalism or even voyeurism that is to say whether the public interest test was satisfied they referred to magyar helsinki bizottság cited above before the court he submitted on the one hand that he had not decided whether to publish on the matter and on the other hand that his request served the interest of informing the public of the fact that the foreign intelligence service potentially may have been involved in the death of ub and that the service was now seeking to obfuscate this fact he had not raised the latter aspects before the domestic courts referring to the drafting history of section of the federal archives act the government submitted that the thirtyyear period of closure provided for by that provision was as a deliberate choice by the legislature designed as not being subject to proportionality considerations such period of closure was not arbitrary also bearing in mind the sensitive nature of the information and was based on a common european standard they referred in particular to france and austria as foreseeing comparable periods of closure the applicants claims that the foreign intelligence service no longer needed the files at issue and was obliged to hand them over to the federal archives earlier was incorrect and had not been raised by the applicant in the domestic proceedings it had to be borne in mind that the period of closure only concerned the right to use files under the federal archives act the federal archives act was however not the only legal avenue based on which it was possible to obtain information and in particular circumstances also to consult files in person as explained such claim could be based on article second sentence of the basic law without the period of closure provided for by the federal archives act being applicable to such claim but the applicants claim on that basis had failed because he had not sufficiently substantiated it the period of closure provided for by the federal archives act was thus neither prohibitive in terms of access to files nor was it decisive for outcome of the applicants request lastly the government submitted that the form of use of the files under the federal archives act was at the discretion of the authority concerned section of the regulation on the use of archival documents from the federal archives and did not necessarily result in allowing the consultation of the files in person even more so in the present case given that the files at issue were those of an intelligence service which would justify a more restrictive approach than the general practice of the federal archives to allow for a consultation of the files if such form of access was requested the third party intervener the centre for democracy and rule of law argued in favour of interpreting article of the convention as a right of the press visàvis the authorities to be given access to information within adequate time this was necessary in order to enable the press to effectively fulfil its role as public watchdog in relation of the authorities the courts assessment the court observes that the circumstances of the present case are particular in that the domestic authorities did not reject the applicants request for access to information on the foreign intelligence services files on ub as such rather following the agreement reached on november the foreign intelligence service disclosed information on the content of the files it held on ub to the applicant see paragraph above thereby satisfying his information request at least in part the court reiterates that article of the convention does not confer in general and absolute terms on the individual a right of access to information held by a public authority nor oblige the government to impart such information to the individual such a right or obligation may however arise where access to information is instrumental for the individuals exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression in particular the freedom to receive and impart information and where its denial constitutes an interference with that right see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above the question whether this threshold has been met can ultimately be left open even assuming that physical access to the impugned files was instrumental for the exercise of the applicants right to freedom of expression and that its denial thus constituted an interference with the applicants article rights it was in any event justified under article of the convention it was in accordance with the law namely section of the federal archives act see paragraphs and above it pursued two legitimate aims foreseen in article of the convention namely the protection of national security and preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence see also šeks v croatia no february and it was necessary in a democratic society for the reasons set out below states enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in the area of national security šeks cited above with further references and classified files of an intelligence service may in principle legitimately be subject to additional access restrictions given that the desired physical access to the files would possibly or even likely also reveal information about the internal functioning and working methods of the intelligence service this aspect needs to be given due consideration in the proportionality assessment at the same time the concepts of national security and public safety should be applied with restraint interpreted restrictively and brought into play only where it has been shown to be necessary to suppress the release of the information for the purposes of protecting national security and public safety ibid and stoll v switzerland gc no echr v the court has recognised that it was not wellequipped to challenge the national authorities judgment concerning the existence of national security considerations however even when national security is at stake the concepts of lawfulness and the rule of law in a democratic society require that measures affecting fundamental human rights must be subject to some form of adversarial proceedings before an independent body competent to review the reasons for the decision if there was no possibility of challenging effectively the executives assertion that national security was at stake the state authorities would be able to encroach arbitrarily on rights protected by the convention see šeks cited above and the references cited therein the court has further stressed that the fairness of proceedings and the procedural guarantees afforded to the applicant are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see ibid and baka v hungary gc no june in cases such as the present one involving national security concerns resulting in decisions restricting human rights the court will therefore scrutinise the national decisionmaking procedure to ensure that it incorporated adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the person concerned see šeks cited above and the references cited therein the court notes that the applicant had access to adversarial proceedings at the administrative level before the foreign intelligence service and subsequently before the federal administrative court with regard to the decisionmaking procedure the court underlines that inasmuch as the domestic authorities are required to assess the proportionality of a refusal of access on the basis of the elements made available to them there is a corresponding requirement on applicants to substantiate the purpose of their request before the domestic authorities if need be in the course of the proceedings before the domestic courts see mikiashvili and others dec nos and january georgian young lawyers association v georgia dec no january centre for democracy and the rule of law dec no march centre for democracy and the rule of law cited above and and studio monitori and others cited above and in this connection the court found that it was not sufficient that an applicant made an abstract point to the effect that certain information should be made accessible as a matter of general principle of openness see centre for democracy and the rule of law dec cited above and in another case the court found the applicant associations statement that the information sought the identity of sanctioned police officers was of public interest to have been too general and found that the applicant association had failed to clarify why despite information having been made available about the authorities response to the incident at issue namely disciplinary proceedings against police officers information about the identity of the sanctioned police officers could be of interest to society as a whole see georgian young lawyers association cited above the court relied on similar considerations in studio monitori and others cited above mikiashvili and others cited above and namazli v azerbaijan dec no and june these considerations which led to the conclusion that article of the convention did not apply to the said information requests because the threshold criteria were not met apply a fortiori in the present case where the authorities disclosed information about the content of the impugned files to the applicant following his request see paragraph above it was therefore incumbent on him to substantiate why physical access to the files held by the foreign intelligence service on ub after having been provided with information on their content by that service was instrumental for the exercise of his right to freedom of expression under article of the convention in his request to the foreign intelligence service the applicant had not explained at all why he needed physical access to the impugned files see paragraph above that service had acknowledged in the proceedings before the federal administrative court that the right of the press to receive information may consolidate to become a right to consult files in person and had pointed out that the applicant had failed to make a substantiated submission in this respect see paragraph above despite being provided with this procedural safeguard the applicant did not respond to this call neither in his further submissions before the federal administrative court nor in his subsequent constitutional complaint compare studio monitori and others cited above and contrast with mikiashvili and others cited above and centre for democracy and the rule of law cited above and in both of which the applicants remedied their initial omissions to give reasons for their requests in the subsequent judicial proceedings nor did he allege before the domestic courts that he had been prevented from making a substantiated submission see paragraphs and above the applicant who limited himself to a general reference to his watchdog role as a journalist to the public interest in the circumstances of ubs death and to the voluminous scope of the files concerned see paragraphs and above thus failed to put the domestic authorities in a position to engage in the necessary balancing of the competing interests contrast centre for democracy and the rule of law cited above therefore the domestic courts can not be reproached for failing to engage in a balancing exercise whether the applicants interests in getting physical access outweighed national security interests in respect of certain documents consequently the court can not conclude that the manner in which the domestic authorities assessed the applicants request had been fundamentally flawed or devoid of procedural safeguards see mutatis mutandis šeks cited above the court also notes that the applicant did not put forward arguments that the information that had been disclosed to him was incorrect in the light of the foregoing the court concludes that the domestic authorities did not overstep their margin of appreciation when they rejected the applicants request for physical access to the foreign intelligence services files there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention in view of this conclusion it is not necessary for the court to rule on the governments objection see paragraph above alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention about the lack of expedition and the length of the proceedings that provision insofar as relevant reads as follows in the determination of his civil rights and obligations everyone is entitled to a fair hearing within a reasonable time by a tribunal established by law the government asserted that the complaint was inadmissible they submitted that the proceedings at issue did firstly not concern a civil right within the meaning of article of the convention the complaint was hence incompatible ratione materiae secondly the applicant had failed to make use of the relevant domestic remedy section of the court constitutions act to complain about the length of the proceedings he had thus not exhausted domestic remedies thirdly he had not either before the domestic courts or before the court pointed to any alleged delays in the proceedings in any event the proceedings had not been excessively long the applicant submitted that the proceedings concerned a civil right within the meaning of article of the convention and by their nature called for particular expedition he had not been required to make use of section of the court constitutions act as that remedy in his submission exclusively aimed at compensation but not at speeding up pending proceedings even assuming that article of the convention is applicable to the proceedings at issue the court considers that the applicant has failed to exhaust domestic remedies as required by article of the convention in respect of his complaint about the length of the proceedings he did not make use of the remedy provided for by domestic law in that respect section of the court constitutions act see paragraph above to complain about the length of the proceedings nor did he raise an objection of delay before the federal administrative court the purpose of which would have been to serve as a warning to that court and to enable it to expedite the proceedings see paragraph above it follows that the applicants complaint under article of convention must be rejected in accordance with article and of the convention for these reasons the courtjoins to the merits the governments objection concerning the incompatibility ratione materiae of the applicants complaint with article of the convention and declares by a majority the complaint concerning article of the convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible holds by four votes to three that there has been no violation of article of the convention holds that it is not necessary to rule on the governments abovementioned objection done in english and notified in writing on november pursuant to rule and of the rules of court milan blaško georges ravarani registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgmenta partly dissenting opinion of judge serghides b dissenting opinion of judge pavli joined by judges ravarani and zünd grmb partly dissenting opinion of judge serghidesi introduction the present judgment see paragraph briefly describes the applicants complaint under article of the convention as being about the governments refusal to allow him to gain physical access and to consult in person the files held by the foreign intelligence service on ub a former prime minister of the land of schleswig holstein who died in a hotel in geneva switzerland in however in the application form under the section headed alleged violations the applicant presents his complaint in a more general manner rather than simply saying that he was not given physical access or allowed to consult the relevant files in person his complaint is that he was not given access to the material information or knowledge held in the archive this not being confined necessarily to the fact of having physical access to the relevant files it is expressed as follows the respondent by not giving access to the material in its possession in the archive violates the applicants sic right to know as well as the freedom of the press in its function as a public watchdog as embodied in art echr there is no justification for withholding the information under art echr therefore the respondent has a duty to render the information requested the withholding of such information is an interference with the freedoms of expression and the press in the form of a right of access to official information in the present matter the respondent is in possession of the information desired there exists no possibility for the applicant to gain such information if not provided by the respondent nonetheless the applicant was denied access to such knowledge the bnd dismissed the respective requests all the legal remedies the applicant lodged with the federal administrative court and the federal constitutional court did not prevail in this respect consequently the applicant has no possibility to inform himself of the facts nor can he report on them in his capacity as representative of the press hence an interference with article echr has occurred my disagreement with the judgment concerns its conclusion that the applicants failure to inform the court about the information disclosed to him in respect of the foreign intelligence services files on ub did not amount to an abuse of the right of application within the meaning of article a of the convention see paragraph in fine of the judgment and point of its operative provisions and consequently its finding that the application is admissible of course my disagreement is not only with that conclusion reached in the judgment but also with the reasoning leading to it see paragraph having regard to the applicants submissions that the information he had received could not replace a consultation of the files in person as the two types of access to information did not yield the same information in terms of quality and quantity the court considers that it can not be established with sufficient certainty that he the applicant intended to mislead the court finding that the application was inadmissible for abuse of the right of individual application under article a i would have rejected the application as such under article of the convention i thus voted against point of the operative provisions of the judgment which by a majority declared the application admissible however assuming that the application was in fact admissible and without casting any doubt on my finding regarding inadmissibility i also voted in favour of point of the operative provisions finding no violation it may seem inconsistent for a judge who voted for inadmissibility to subsequently vote regarding an operative point dealing with the merits but rule of the rules of court requires this by providing as follows the decisions and judgments of the grand chamber and the chambers shall be adopted by a majority of the sitting judges abstentions shall not be allowed in final votes on the admissibility and merits of cases ii rule article a of the convention as an aspect of the right of individual application and the effective protection of human rights in my humble view an abuse of the right of individual application can be considered parasitic in relation to this right and one of its greatest enemies this is so because the concept of abuse must be understood as a harmful exercise of a right of individual application with a purpose other than those for which it is designed the right of individual application which is institutionalised and guaranteed by article of the convention is one of the most significant features of the convention because without this right the court would be devoid of jurisdiction under articles and of the convention to protect the rights guaranteed in the convention article a of the convention dealing with admissibility criteria provides that the court shall declare inadmissible any individual application if it considers that the application is an abuse of the right of individual application in my view this rule is one side of the protection of the right to individual application this side of the protection falls on the applicants who are expected not to lodge improper applications with the court the other side of the protection of the right of individual application falls on the member states to the convention as stated in paragraph two of article the high contracting parties undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this right of course the purpose of the rule in article a is not only to protect the right of individual application but also the process before the court and the court itself in my submission the principle of effectiveness as a norm of international law which is enshrined in convention provisions safeguarding human rights including article is also enshrined in article a and article of the convention the norm of effectiveness enshrined in article a requires that a petition before the court be considered inadmissible if there is an abuse of the right of individual application and as said above the purpose of this provision is to protect the right of individual application and the substantive rights safeguarded by the convention the same principle as a method of interpretation should be followed in interpreting article a in this capacity the principle of effectiveness requires that the text and purpose of the provision in question should be given their fullest weight an individual application can be described as a vehicle through which the rights of an applicant safeguarded by the convention can be protected by the court consequently if there is either abuse or obstruction of the right of individual application the effective protection of the rights guaranteed by the convention may entirely collapse so the discussion to be followed should be undertaken in the light of the effective protection of individual application and the right concerned thus the right to freedom of expression safeguarded by article as well as the protection of the process before the court and the court itself iii abuse of the right of application the government underlined that the information on the content of the foreign intelligence services files which the applicant had requested had been disclosed to him they further argued that the applicant had not actually been denied access to the desired information and that he had not argued that the information disclosed to him was incorrect or insufficient rather following the agreement reached on november the foreign intelligence service had disclosed to the applicant certain information on the content of the files it held on ub thereby satisfying his information request at least in part the government in their observations alleged that in filing his application the applicant had failed to disclose to the court that on december and january the german intelligence service bnd had provided him with comprehensive factual information on the content of the documents held by the bnd pertaining to ub which he had then used for a newspaper article on the subject published on february shortly before lodging his application on february in fact as is clear from the judgment see paragraphs and there was not just one article but two articles published by the applicant in bild based on the information he had received the other was published on july lastly the government argued that the applicant had created a fundamentally misleading impression of the facts and circumstances around which the present case before the court revolved by entirely concealing the nature and scope of the factual information disclosed to him and the use he had made of that information for a publication the first article appearing just a few days before he lodged his application an application constitutes an abuse of the right of individual application where the applicant has knowingly presented the facts and circumstances regarding an aspect that is essential for adjudicating the application in an untruthful or incomplete manner the same applies to cases where the applicant fails to disclose facts and circumstances of which he was already aware at the time of lodging the application such as facts and circumstances potentially being significant for the courts examination consequently incomplete and therefore misleading information may also amount to an abuse of the right of application especially if the information concerns the very core of the case and no sufficient or plausible explanation is given by the applicant for the failure to disclose the relevant information hüttner v germany dec no june an authoritative statement of all the above and containing the necessary components of abuse of the right of application can be found in gross v switzerland gc no september the court reiterates that under this provision article a an application may be rejected as an abuse of the right of individual application if among other reasons it was knowingly based on untrue facts the submission of incomplete and thus misleading information may also amount to an abuse of the right of application especially if the information concerns the very core of the case and no sufficient explanation has been provided for the failure to disclose that information see hüttner v germany dec no june predescu cited above and kowal v poland dec no september the same applies if important new developments have occurred during the proceedings before the court and where despite being expressly required to do so by rule former rule of the rules of court the applicant has failed to disclose that information to the court thereby preventing it from ruling on the case in full knowledge of the facts see centro europa srl and di stefano cited above and miroļubovs and others cited above however even in such cases the applicants intention to mislead the court must always be established with sufficient certainty see al nashif v bulgaria no june melnik v ukraine no march nold v germany no june and centro europa srl and di stefano cited above in my humble view the present application constitutes an abuse of the right of individual application within the meaning of article a for the reasons which will be explained below the applicant failed to disclose in his application that he had received from the authorities relevant and important information relating to his complaint some of which he had used in two articles he published by doing so he presented the facts in his application form in an incomplete manner capable of misleading the court the information not disclosed to the court concerned the very core of the case as it was an essential part of what the applicant was requesting from the authorities and he had thus used it in two articles as mentioned above while again failing to inform the court about them there is sufficient certainty of the applicants intention to mislead the court by failing to disclose the relevant and important information he received from the authorities he knew that the information he submitted to the court was incomplete but he nevertheless concealed the fact that he had received such information serious negligence is also sufficient see william a schabas the european convention on human rights a commentary oup at p the fact that he was not satisfied on account of not receiving from the authorities all the information he had asked for does not exempt or excuse him from revealing the information he had received the judgment in paragraph acknowledges that the applicant had indeed concealed important information and created a misleading impression of the facts of the case some of the applicants initial submissions notably that he had effectively been denied access to the information that withholding information on which the authorities had a monopoly amounted to censorship and that he was unable to research or report on the topic created the impression that he had not received any information given that the applicant had in fact received information on the scope of the foreign intelligence services files on ub the reason for their creation and their content following an agreement he had reached with the authorities in parallel to the proceedings leading to the present application the applicant had indeed concealed important information and created a misleading impression of the facts of the case the same paragraph of the judgment though consistent in acknowledging that the applicant had indeed concealed important information on the scope of his complaint and stating that his conduct is at least deplorable thereby implying an intention to mislead subsequently concludes that such intention can not be established with sufficient certainty in the judgment the lack of sufficient certainty is established after having regard to the applicants submissions that the information he had received could not replace a consultation of the files in person as the two types of access to information did not yield the same information in terms of quality and quantity see paragraph but for me the fact that the applicant did not receive from the authorities the whole of what he had asked for but only a part of it albeit containing important information concerning the core of his complaint which he had also used does not allow him to conceal this fact so this justification or explanation is not sufficient or plausible lack of a plausible explanation in the submissions of the applicant establishes sufficient certainty of his intention to mislead the court in this connection it is also important to note that the applicants complaint in his application form is not limited to a consultation of the files in person see paragraph of this opinion but extends to having access to material and information see also the passage from paragraph of the judgment this fact makes the applicants explanation for not revealing the information he received even weaker and lacking in credibility article of the convention safeguarding the right to freedom of expression provides that this right shall include freedom to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers it does not provide for a right to have access to every file kept by the authorities in their totality article in fact does not confer in general and absolute terms on the individual a right of access to information held by a public authority nor does it oblige the government to impart such information to the individual such a right or obligation may nevertheless arise where access to information is instrumental for the individuals exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression in particular the freedom to receive and impart information and where denial constitutes interference with that right see magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no november in his application form the applicant nowhere gives even a hint that he received important and relevant information from the authorities on the contrary he gives exactly the opposite impression ie that he received no information at all in particular under the part of his application dealing with the alleged violations he argues that there is no justification for withholding the information under art echr nonetheless the applicant was denied access to such knowledge the bnd dismissed the respective requests the applicant though relying on the provision of rule b of the rules of court to supplement the information in his application form by appending to it further details on the facts and the alleged violations of the convention and the relevant arguments again made no mention of the information he had received from the authorities towards the end of this appendix the applicant observes that the withholding of the requested information in the present matter precludes a moral assessment which is one of the functions of the press though the applicant correctly refers to moral assessment as a function of the press there is also a moral element in not abusing the right of individual application and not preventing the court from performing its function and noble mission to correctly apply the convention while having before it all the relevant facts the applicant had a duty towards the court to disclose all the information he was given by the authorities and if this information was insufficient for him he could have explained why since the information not disclosed was relevant it was for the court to decide whether or not it concerned the very core of the case and the applicant had an obligation to include it in his application form the court could simply have rejected the application as noncompliant with rule of the rules of court if it had known about this failure to disclose relevant facts at an earlier stage of the proceedings it is useful to refer to the relevant provisions of the rules of court rule provides that an application under article of the convention shall contain all of the information requested in the relevant parts of the application form and set out e a concise and legible statement of the facts rule a provides that all of the information referred to in paragraph e to g above that is set out in the relevant part of the application form should be sufficient to enable the court to determine the nature and scope of the application without recourse to any other document this provision refers to the scope of the application and it is to be underlined here that the judgment in paragraph notes that the information the applicant received and failed to disclose to the court was in fact on the scope of the foreign intelligence services files on ub the reason for their creation and their content an important provision of the rules of court concerning the consequences of failing to comply with the requirements of the above provisions is rule which provides failure to comply with the requirements set out in paragraphs to of this rule will result in the application not being examined by the court unless a the applicant has provided an adequate explanation for the failure to comply b the application concerns a request for an interim measure c the court otherwise directs of its own motion or at the request of an applicant lastly rule provides that applicants shall keep the court informed of any change of address and of all circumstances relevant to the application this provision is also referred to in terms of the issue of an abuse of the right of individual application by the passage cited from gross v switzerland cited above that the applicant used the information he received from the authorities in two articles he published was something which he should have mentioned in his application as provided in rule in my opinion the proposed finding of an abuse of the right of individual application is the result of the best interpretation and application of the provision of article a to the facts of the present case by following the principle of effectiveness as a norm of international law and as a method of interpretation again in my humble view the finding of the judgment that there has been no abuse of individual application lacks any factual and legal basis and defeats the very purpose of article a iv conclusion in the light of all the above i would have rejected the application based on article of the convention for being inadmissible due to an abuse of the right of individual application and this is something that the court might have done under the said provision at any stage of the proceedings but regrettably did not do so dissenting opinion of judge pavlijoined by judges ravarani and zünd i have voted against the finding of no violation of article in this case apart from the difference of opinion on the outcome my disagreement with the majority extends to certain key findings of fact as well as the methodology that has been followed to reach this conclusion which risks muddying the waters of our developing jurisprudence in this relatively novel field first it is necessary to start with an important factual clarification the respondent government have put forward the misleading argument that the applicant was not denied access to the desired information and he did not argue that the information disclosed to him was incorrect or insufficient see paragraph of the judgment i am unable to agree with this submission the applicant requested access to thousands of pages of primary source information collected by the german intelligence service in relation to the suspicious death of a senior government official several decades ago what he received from the intelligence service as a result of an outofcourt settlement was merely a highlevel description of the categories of information that the relevant files contained see paragraph of the judgment while such information may be quite useful in certain circumstances perhaps as a preliminary step in narrowing down a wideranging request it is simply not what the applicant asked for it is the equivalent of requesting to read a book and being offered its table of contents as a perfectly good alternative the applicant has never received access to a single page from the original files unfortunately the majority have chosen to gloss over this crucial distinction and to accept that the applicants information request was satisfied at least in part see paragraph of the judgment this fallacy lays the ground for much of the majoritys reasoning a second steppingstone to the finding of no violation of article is the majoritys reluctance to hold that the threshold conditions for the applicability of article were clearly met in this case the question of applicability is first joined to the merits see paragraph of the judgment and then ultimately left open presumably on the basis that article does not necessarily grant a right of physical access to government files see paragraph of the judgment this conclusion is based in my view on a significant misunderstanding of both our existing jurisprudence and the way virtually all access to information regimes operate in the european space to begin with the majoritys timidity would seem to suggest that this is the first time the court has been faced with such a question as this is not the case in my view there was no need to question or cast doubt on a wellestablished element of our article caselaw a large number of access to information cases decided by various sections of the court following the grand chambers groundbreaking magyar helsinki judgment magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no november have dealt specifically with requests by applicants for access to original documents ie primarysource information held by state authorities in none of these cases has it been disputed neither by the respondent governments nor by the court that article applies in principle to such requests this being a question of the courts ratione materiae jurisdiction it ought to have been considered in any event of the courts own motion as a result it seems obvious to conclude that the court has long accepted expressly or implicitly that a right of access to the original files or documents held by a government authority is protected in principle by article the majority have chosen to ignore this line of caselaw furthermore the majoritys approach is at odds with a core and widely accepted conception of the right to information in european comparative law as well as under council of europe standardsetting instruments the primary form of access guaranteed by these laws including the german federal access law itself is direct access to primary official documents and sources irrespective of their format whether as an original complete and authentic paper copy electronic copy and so on this is also a matter of common sense any serious journalist or researcher would want to see the original government data not merely information about the information the metadata or a governmentprepared summary of the requested information the fundamental guarantees of article do not rest on the assumption that the government version of events is always to be trusted any researcher who has spent time leafing through dusty old records in government archives would testify to that the practice is older than the lost library of alexandria the court itself has emphasised in a national security context that access to original documentary sources for legitimate historical research is an essential element of the exercise of the right to freedom of expression see kenedi v hungary no may thirdly the majority find that article has not been violated despite the national courts manifest failure to engage in any meaningful balancing of the applicants article interest in obtaining access to the original files in whole or in part against any ongoing national security interests in preserving their secrecy the judgment does so by relying on the applicants supposed failure to sufficiently justify before the domestic authorities the need for physical access as such an omission that presumably failed to put the domestic authorities in a position to engage in the necessary balancing of the competing interests see paragraph of the judgment in other words the majority like the national courts wonder why the applicant could not have been satisfied with having received the table of contents rather than the whole book while investigating a complex set of events related to a death under disputed circumstances that had attracted a great deal of public interest in fact this core question is tied to a structural problem in the german access to information regime the intelligence services being entirely exempted from the scope of federal access to information law the only option left to journalists and to journalists exclusively for requesting access to their information is to rely on a complex mix of judgemade constitutional remedies andor landbased legislation the applicants case suggests however that these remedies are imperfect and subject to a high substantive threshold and burden of proof to be met by the requester the right of the press to receive information may consolidate to become a right to consult files in person under certain undefined scenarios see paragraph of the judgment these national thresholds are arguably stricter and therefore incompatible with the fourfactor threshold set by the courts grand chamber in magyar helsinki cited above for article to become applicable the lack of a generalised constitutional basis for the right of access to official information at the german federal level such that it would be commensurate with the level of protection guaranteed by article of the convention is another source of complication this idiosyncratic national legal framework as applicable to the intelligence services in this particular case is hardly compatible with our own established jurisprudence an aspect that the judgment does not address any national legal framework that shields or exempts entire government agencies from the operation of the right of access to government information or that categorically bars requesters from access to certain primary sources in the absence of any balancing of interests is bound to run into similar convention problems in my view nothing in this separate opinion should be taken of course to suggest that people should be able to roam freely through the intelligence agencies archives on the other hand as national security data about historical events of general importance become older or liable to be declassified the interests of historical research and the publics right to know become stronger and may tip the balance in favour of disclosure in whole or in part see kenedi cited above involving access to historical records of the hungarian secret service established democracies have developed multiple mechanisms to do this without undermining the internal working methods or sources of the services or other remaining national security concerns redactions and partial disclosure being among these standard tools in line with the principle of proportionality had the national authorities put forward sound substantive reasons as to why national security would have been seriously jeopardised by granting the applicant any degree of access to the physical files and had the national courts scrutinised such arguments in line with article standards the refusal of physical access in whole or in part might be considered justified conversely the failure of the domestic authorities to engage in any meaningful balancing of the substantive interests at stake is sufficient in my view to find a violation of article in this case the majoritys strictly procedural approach means that the court itself has also missed an opportunity to enrich our jurisprudence on questions of historical memory in a national security context see among other cases cangi v turkey no january studio monitori and others v georgia dec nos and january centre for democracy and the rule of law v ukraine dec no

6,the applicant was born in and lives in weinheim he is a campaigner against abortion and operates an antiabortion website on and april the applicant distributed leaflets in the vicinity of the medical practice of dr st who performed abortions there the leaflets stated inter alia that the abortions performed by dr st in his practice for which he gave the address were unlawful according to the caselaw of the federal constitutional court in addition the leaflet contained the following statements according to international criminal law aggravated murder is the intentional bringingtodeath of an innocent human being sinngemӓβ aus den internationalen strafgesetzen mord ist das vorsӓtzliche zu tode bringen eines unschuldigen menschen the murder of human beings in auschwitz was unlawful but the morally degraded ns state allowed the murder of innocent people and did not make it subject to criminal liability die ermordung der menschen in auschwitz war rechtswidrig aber der moralisch verkommene nsstaat hatte den mord an den unschuldigen menschen erlaubt und nicht unter strafe gestellt the applicant also addressed passersby and the physicians presumed patients and attempted to engage with them in conversations about abortion dr st lodged an application for a civil injunction against the applicant and on october the mannheim regional court granted the requested injunction the court ordered the applicant to desist from speaking to passersby in the immediate vicinity of the medical practice and labelling the abortions performed by the plaintiff unlawful with the objective of irritating female patients and preventing them from visiting dr sts practice on february the karlsruhe court of appeal upheld the decision and slightly modified the wording specifying the geographical area concerned by the injunction it also refused to grant leave to appeal on points of law the regional court as well as the court of appeal both referred to a previous decision of the federal court of justice in which it had confirmed a civil injunction against similar conduct by the applicant see paragraph below the courts held that in the case at issue there were no factual or legal differences justifying deviating from the caselaw of the federal court of justice in so far that the doctor in the present case was slightly more wellknown than the doctor in the original case the court of appeal held that this was of minor relevance the fact that dr st had appeared as an expert before the german parliament many years previously did not have any substantial effects on dr sts public profile at that time moreover the involvement of dr st in different legal disputes was irrelevant as trying to enforce his rights in the appropriate legal procedure could not redound to dr sts disadvantage in sum the applicant had vilified the noncriminal professional activities of dr st by implying that he committed criminal acts and interfered with the relationship of trust between doctor and patient which deserved special protection against the interventions of others the applicant had therefore severely interfered with dr sts personality rights this interference was not justified by the applicants freedom of expression in view of the massive pillory effect the applicant had created by singling out the plaintiff and criticising him in a harsh way in the immediate vicinity of his practice on may the federal court of justice refused a request by the applicant for legal aid on the grounds that the applicants intended appeal on points of law lacked sufficient prospect of success on july the federal constitutional court refused to admit the applicants complaint for adjudication for being inadmissible without providing reasons no bv r ii relevant domestic law and practice the relevant provisions of the german basic law grundgesetz criminal code strafgesetzbuch and civil code bürgerliches gesetzbuch have been set out in the courts judgment in annen no no september in addition on december the federal court of justice confirmed an injunction ordering the applicant to desist from addressing patients and passersby in a specified area in front of a medical practice and from pointing out that in the practice abortions were performed no vi zr it pointed out that the doctors activities were legal and enjoyed protection under his constitutional right to freedom to exercise his profession the court emphasised the important role which the legislature had attributed to gynaecologists both in the protection of unborn life and in the protection of the health of the women concerned it was essential that the relationship of trust between the doctor and his patients was not disturbed by the intrusion of external parties the applicants actions had adversely affected the plaintiffs activities in an unacceptable way and had singled him out without any reason therefore the court concluded that under the circumstances of this particular case the physicians personality rights prevailed over the applicants freedom of expression a constitutional complaint against the judgment of the federal court of justice was not admitted for adjudication the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the injunction ordering him to desist from addressing passersby in the immediate vicinity of dr sts medical practice and from labelling the abortions performed by the plaintiff unlawful had violated his freedom of expression as provided in article of the convention which reads in so far as relevant as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or rights of others a admissibility the court notes that this complaint is neither inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remedies see annen v germany no november nor manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions the applicant argued that the desist order had interfered with his freedom of expression without being justified by the protection of the personality rights of dr st he submitted that his distribution of leaflets and the intended conversations with passersby had contributed to a public debate of great importance his actions had not personally attacked dr st but had criticised the legal situation in germany concerning abortions which had been performed by a doctor within twelve weeks of conception and following obligatory counseling those abortions had been considered to be unlawful but had been exempt from criminal liability moreover it had been consistent with the caselaw of the federal constitutional court to call abortions as performed by dr st unlawful the applicant further submitted that the domestic courts had not sufficiently taken into account that dr st had not been unknown to the public as the doctor had been in the earlier case decided by the federal court of justice but had appeared as an expert before the german parliament and had been involved in several legal disputes in the context of the debate about abortion the government submitted that the interference with the applicants freedom of expression which had been based on article in conjunction with article of the civil code had been necessary to safeguard dr sts personality rights as enshrined in article of the convention by calling abortions unlawful the applicant had created the false impression that dr st had been operating outside of the legal framework in performing such procedures unlike the leaflet in the case of annen cited above the leaflets in the present case did not point out that abortions are permitted in germany under the terms of article a of the criminal code and therefore not subject to criminal liability moreover given the applicants goal of forced pavement counselling the applicant had severely disturbed the relationship of trust between doctor and patient the court had already rejected an earlier application by the same applicant against a desist order against similar conduct see annen v germany dec nos march in the present case the domestic courts had relied on the judgment of the federal court of justice which had been the subject matter of the earlier inadmissibility decision of the court and concluded that the circumstances had been comparable and had not warranted deviating from the existing caselaw when coming to that conclusion the domestic courts had paid attention to the fact that dr st had taken a public position in the abortion debate the courts assessment at the outset the court considers and this is not in dispute between the parties that the injunction interfered with the applicants freedom of expression had a legal basis and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and reputation of dr st as well as the rights of patients to medical counseling it therefore remains to be determined whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society and whether the balancing exercise undertaken by the domestic courts was in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the fundamental principles concerning the question of whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the courts caselaw and have recently been summarised as follows see delfi as v estonia gc no june with further referencesi freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society as set forth in article this freedom is subject to exceptions which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article iii the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts the court further reiterates that the right to protection of reputation is protected by article of the convention as part of the right to respect for private life see chauvy and others v france no echr vi pfeifer v austria no november and polanco torres and movilla polanco v spain no september in order for article to come into play however an attack on a persons reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be made in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see a v norway no april axel springer ag v germany gc no february and delfi as cited above in cases that concerned allegations of criminal conduct the court also took into account that under article of the convention individuals have a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty see among other authorities worm v austria august reports of judgments and decisions v and du roy and malaurie v france no echr x when examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interests of the protection of the reputation or rights of others the court may be required to ascertain whether the domestic authorities have struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see hachette filipacchi associés v france no june mgn limited v the united kingdom no january axel springer ag cited above and delfi as cited above turning to the circumstances of the present case the court observes that the domestic courts justified the injunction by in essence three points that interfered with the doctors private and professional life and taken together reached a severity that dr st should not have had to endure firstly the applicant had vilified dr st by implying that he had committed criminal acts secondly he had singled out dr st from all doctors that had performed abortions and had thereby created a pillory effect and lastly the applicant had interfered with the particularly protected relationship of trust between dr st and his patients in regard to the first aspect the court reiterates that it has held in a previous decision see annen v germany dec nos march that german law under article a of the criminal code draws a fine line between abortions which are considered to be unlawful but exempt from criminal liability and those abortions which are considered as justified and thus lawful it follows that the applicants statement that the physician performed among others unlawful abortions was correct from a strictly judicial point of view however having regard to the fact that the applicant primarily addressed his statement to laypersons the court accepts that the domestic courts also took into account the point of view of a reasonable man with ordinary susceptibility who would assume that the unlawful abortions were forbidden in a stricter sense and subject to criminal liability this conclusion is not called into question by the courts later judgment in the case of annen cited above since in that case the leaflet in question provided sufficiently clear further explanation according to which abortions were not subject to criminal liability the court therefore agrees with the conclusion of the domestic courts regarding the first aspect concerning the issue of singling out dr st the court notes that the applicant submitted that the former had been known to the public had appeared as an expert before the german parliament and had been involved in several legal disputes in the context of the debate about abortion however the court also takes note of the fact that the domestic courts considered these points and concluded that they were only of minor relevance the appearance before the german parliament had been many years previous to that time and therefore did not have any substantial effects on dr sts public profile the involvement of dr st in different legal disputes was irrelevant as trying to enforce his rights in the appropriate legal procedure could not redound to dr sts disadvantage the court would reiterate that a distinction has to be made between private individuals and persons acting in a public context as political figures or public figures and that a private individual unknown to the public may claim particular protection of his or her right to private life see axel springer ag v germany gc no february with further references nonetheless having regard to their direct and continuous contact with their societies it is primarily for the domestic courts to assess how well known a person is especially where that person is mainly known at national level ibid in conclusion the court finds the domestic courts reasoning that dr sts prior conduct had only minor relevance for the present assessment acceptable and sees no reason to call the courts conclusions concerning how well known dr st was into question turning to the issue of the applicants interfering with the relationship of trust between dr st and his patients the court reiterates that it has already accepted that a civil injunction was in particular based on the fact that the applicant approached the doctors patients in the direct vicinity of his medical practice and thus seriously disturbed the exercise of his professional activities see annen v germany dec cited above the court observes that such pavement counselling by the applicant which the regional court described as running the gauntlet did not only interfere with the dr sts legal professional activities but also rendered it more difficult for patients to seek medical assistance the court therefore sees no reason to deviate from its previous findings in the present case the foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the court to conclude that the reasons advanced for the interference complained of were relevant and sufficient furthermore the court observes that the applicant was not criminally convicted for slander or ordered to pay damages contrast pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi but only prevented from addressing passersby in the immediate vicinity of dr sts medical practice and from labelling the abortions performed by the plaintiff unlawful consequently the injunction was limited geographically and in scope in regard to the latter the court notes that the applicant was not per se prohibited from campaigning against abortion criticising doctors that conducted abortions or distributing leaflets in sum the court concludes that the level of interference with the applicants freedom of expression was relatively low and proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued lastly concerning the thoroughness of assessing the conflicting interests by the domestic courts the court observes that they in essence referred to the previous judgment of the federal court see paragraph above and assessed whether the present case required deviating from the existing caselaw in cases where the balancing exercise between the right to freedom of expression and personality rights had already been thoroughly undertaken in a comparable case the court sees no problem with referring to the respective judgment and to merely consider the factual and legal differences of the cases the court therefore considers that the domestic courts thoroughly assessed the conflicting interests there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the complaint concerning article admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rules of court

7,in and lives in zagreb he was represented by mrs v drenški lasan a lawyer practising in zagreb the government were represented by their agent mrs š stažnik the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows on june the applicant a retired politician who had previously held high political functions in the country lodged a request with the croatian state archive hrvatski državni arhiv hereinafter the state archive to be granted access to fiftysix documents that formed part of the archival collection of the office of the president of the republic of croatia for the period between and the applicant stated that he needed those records in order to write a documentary history of the founding of the croatian state given that the documents in question were classified as state secret strictly confidential for a period of thirty years the state archive requested the office of the president of the republic of croatia as the owner of those documents to decide on whether or not they should be declassified prior to taking a decision the office of the president requested the opinion of the office of the national security council ured vijeća za nacionalnu sigurnost hereinafter the national security council the national security council examined the applicants request and the contents of the requested records and concluded that owing to the nature of the contents of certain records the need to safeguard the values for which those documents had been declared secret in the first place namely the independence integrity and national security of the republic of croatia and its foreign relations still prevailed the disclosure of the said documents would in the opinion of the office of the national security council cause harm to the values protected under section of the data secrecy act see paragraph below subsequently on august the office of the president declassified thirtyone of the requested documents but declined to declassify the remaining twentyfive documents the documents that remained secret were transcripts from certain sessions held in and by the defence and national security council of which the applicant had been a member an advisory body to the president of the republic which at the material time had examined strategic issues of state policy and national security and had coordinated the activities of the highest state bodies and institutions certain records of meetings between the then president of croatia and senior foreign officials and croatian officials were also left classified by the office of the president in the reasoning for its decision not to declassify the latter documents the office of the president held as follows having taken into account the request submitted by the applicant as well as the contents of specific records the office of the national security council was of the opinion that owing to the contents of certain records transcripts the need to protect the values in defence of which those records had originally been classified independence the integrity and security of the republic of croatia and the foreign relations of the republic of croatia still prevailed therefore those individual records transcripts should not be declassified accordingly the office of the national security council deemed that the documents listed in this decision contained information the disclosure of which might potentially jeopardise the values listed in section of the data secrecy act in view of the above and given that under section of the data secrecy act the opinion of the office of the national security council is not binding but the owner of the information has the exclusive authority to ultimately decide whether the classification of certain data is to remain or be changed or if that data is to be declassified it has been established that declassifying some of the requested documents might cause irreparable harm to the values listed in section of the data secrecy act and that the protection of those values prevails over the interest of the public which is why the degree of classification of the documents listed in this decision is maintained following the decision of the office of the president on september the state archive refused the applicants request for the declassification of the abovementioned twentyfive records which remained top secret and granted his request to be allowed early access to archival material from that collection with respect to the thirtyone records that had been declassified by the presidents decision on september the applicant lodged an appeal with the information commissioner alleging inter alia that the contested ruling had been arbitrary unfair and devoid of any clear criteria because he had been granted access to transcripts of certain meetings but not to other conversations between the same persons on july the information commissioner dismissed the applicants appeal for the purpose of the appeal proceedings she directly inspected the documents in question and ultimately accepted the conclusion that their declassification may harm national security and foreign relations noting in addition that the applicant had failed to provide arguments in his appeal as to why those documents should have been declassified or why his interest in accessing the information outweighed the public interest in protecting the aims at stake the information commissioner also stated that under the relevant domestic law and practice only the owner of the documents in issue in this case the office of the president of the republic had the power to alter the classification level of confidential information and that the procedure followed by that body had been lawful on september the applicant brought an action for judicial review in the high administrative court of the republic of croatia visoki upravni sud republike hrvatske seeking to have quashed the information commissioners ruling which in his view did not contain any reasoning in respect of why certain records had been declassified while others had not in her reply the information commissioner stressed that only the owner of the documents in question had the power to declassify them on october the high administrative court dismissed the applicants action it found that the applicant had not contested the facts but only the application of the law that the information commissioner had acted lawfully when she had dismissed his appeal and that she had provided clear and valid reasoning for her decision it held that in the case at hand the owner of the information and the body with the power to classify but also to declassify it is the president of the republic when there is a public interest in the disclosure of such information its owner is under an obligation to assess the proportionality between the right of access to information and the protection of the values listed in sections and of the data secrecy act and to decide whether to maintain the degree of classification amend it or declassify the information at issue however before reaching its decision the owner of the information must request the opinion of the office of the national security council in line with section of the data secrecy act it can be seen from the case file that following the applicants request the prescribed procedure was followed given that the firstinstance public authority requested the declassification of the documents in question by the owner of the information which after obtaining the opinion of the office of the national security council decided not to declassify them that being so the state archive was not authorised to provide the requested information on appeal the information commissioner inspected the opinion of the office of the national security council which stated that owing to the contents of certain documents transcripts the need to protect the values in defence of which those records had originally been classified the independence integrity and security of the republic of croatia and its foreign relations still prevailed and gave the opinion that declassifying certain documents could cause damage to the values listed in section of the data secrecy act given that under section of the data secrecy act the owner of classified information has the exclusive power to decide whether to maintain alter the level of the classification or declassify the information in question in the opinion of this court the state archive respected the prescribed procedure and in accordance with the opinion of the office of the national security council and the decision of the owner of the information lawfully rejected the request of the applicant for access to the information in question and the information commissioner on appeal correctly established that in the present case the protection of the values listed in section of the data secrecy act prevailed over the public interest in the publishing of the protected information and that the decision of the owner of the information had been rendered following a lawful procedure therefore in view of the cited legal provisions on which the information commissioners decision is based as well as the facts established in the proceedings this court finds that the information commissioner correctly dismissed the applicants appeal against the state archives decision and that it provided clear and valid reasons for that decision which is entirely upheld by this court the objection of the applicant that the refusal of his request was not sufficiently reasoned is therefore illfounded and his objection relating to voluntarism voluntarizam in disclosing the requested information is not proven and in light of the lawful procedure in the present case and the discretionary powers of the owner of the information as regards declassification of classified information has no bearing on a different outcome of the present case on december the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court ustavni sud republike hrvatske complaining inter alia of a breach of his right to a fair trial and of his right of access to information on march the constitutional court sitting as a bench of twelve judges dismissed the applicants constitutional complaint having concluded that there had been an interference with the applicants right of access to information because his academic work had been a matter of public interest and that the interference had been lawful the constitutional court held as follows as regards the legitimate aim the constitutional court points out that the impugned judgment in addition to relying on section of the data secrecy act and section of the access to information act stated that the opinion of the office of the national security council had been obtained the constitutional court considers that a more detailed specification of the legitimate reasons for the denial of access to the information sought in the specific circumstances of the present case namely upholding the interests of the state in the areas of independence integrity national security and the international relations of the republic of croatia would constitute a problem amounting to the disclosure of that protected information to the extent that the legitimate reasons for denying access to the information sought have been specified in the present case see subsection of section above the constitutional court considers that the said interference was necessary in a free and democratic society and proportionate to the nature of the need the constitutional court has already explained its previously stated opinion mutatis mutandis in its decision no uiii three judges of the constitutional court dissented in the dissenting opinion of two of them judges lk and gs stated as follows firstly the applicants right to effective legal protection has been limited in the course of the administrative proceedings by the president of the republic of croatia as the firstinstance administrative authority as well as by the information commissioner and the administrative courts in the case at hand the violation of the constitutional right to effective legal protection is twofold on the one hand the violation occurred because the refusal to grant access to the documents in question by the president was not sufficiently reasoned on the other hand the applicants right was violated because the information commissioner and the administrative courts failed to fulfil their supervisory function and refused to examine the substantive content justification for the assessment of the need to deny access a precisely defined goal the manner in which the protected aim was jeopardised the scope of any possible damage the risk of such damage occurring but instead limited their assessment to a mere review of the formal reasons given the citing of legal provisions a review of the relevant deadlines and on the inclusion of advisory bodies secondly we consider that there has been a violation of the applicants constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression the applicant sought access to a certain number of presidential records with a view to conducting research and analysis for a book covering political events that occurred during the period of croatian history that the records in question concern the denial of access to those records can not be contested if there indeed is a reason on the basis of which it could be concluded that their publication would cause irreparable harm to the national security integrity and independence of the republic of croatia however the applicant and the public do not know whether their publication would indeed have such an effect because they have been prevented from knowing whether an assessment has been conducted at all and if so whether it was sufficiently serious and rigorous the applicant is supposed to trust the state authorities without having had a chance to question their assessment or to provide counterarguments this has effectively defied the point of the constitutional right to freedom of expression as one of the constitutional forms of protection from arbitrary abuse of the power afforded to the authorities without being given any real opportunity to question the substance of the assessment of the existence of any risk of irreparable harm to the interests of the republic of croatia the applicant has been denied his right to effective legal protection of his constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression therefore in the present case the violation of the constitutional guarantee of effective legal protection in administrative proceedings at the same time constitutes a breach of the constitutional freedom of expression in its procedural aspect the president of the republic certainly has the authority to deny access to presidential records however that authority is not absolute it is subject to an assessment of the risk of irreparable harm being done to the national interests of the republic of croatia the president adopted the decision in the present case in the form of an administrative decision which therefore has to be reasoned the sufficiency of that reasoning is to be assessed in each individual case on the basis of the specific circumstances of the case the president is not obliged to state the reasons which may jeopardise the aim of classifying the documents in question but merely stating that the president has the authority to deny access in order to protect secrecy she requested the opinion of the council she received the opinion whereby the national security council expresses its view that it is necessary to maintain the existing secrecy classification and she agreed with that opinion with the aim of protecting the interests of the national security integrity and independence of the republic of croatia and its international reputation does not satisfy the requirement of sufficiency first of all such reasoning does not indicate that a proportionality test was indeed conducted citizens are requested to simply assume that the president of the republic conducted a proportionality test as required by the data secrecy act although on the basis of such reasoning it is possible to doubt whether the decision has been adopted as a result of somebodys subjective impression that the requested documents should not become public just to be on the safe side we do not question that in cases such as the present one it is quite possible for the authority from which access to classified information is being requested will not have at its disposal many facts which it might otherwise be able to refer to in its reasoning as evidence that its decision to refuse a request for declassification is justified without jeopardising the purpose of the classification by the publication thereof however such reasoning can not boil down to stating general aims which the denial of access is supposed to protect such as the independence integrity or safety of the republic of croatia or of its international relations reasoning that does not indicate more specifically the reasons for arguing that the publication of the requested information might jeopardise what are in essence the highest interests of the republic of croatia does not support the assumption that a proportionality test has actually been conducted a proportionality test requires the public authority to examine the adequacy of the impugned measure and its necessity it is not possible to achieve either of those if the goal of the measure in question is set hypothetically and in the abstract this is particularly applicable under the circumstances of the present case indeed despite exerting ones best attempts it is not easy to understand the reasons that would justify the assumption that the publication of conversations that took place almost a quarter of a century ago between two statesmen who died many years ago about a historical period and events concerning which in the interim much has been discovered could jeopardise the integrity of the republic of croatia today moreover were these hypothetical and abstract reasons to constitute sufficient reason to deny access to records concerning events of such a nature then they would be sufficient to justify any act of public authority that limits the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens the applicants attorney received the constitutional courts decision on april on february in an interview given to a daily newspaper the applicant stated that he had finished writing his book and that it would be published in a few months he also stated that should the strasbourg court

involving either reconsideration by a public authority or review in accordance with paragraph above the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the refusal to declassify the documents that he had tried to access had amounted to a breach of his right to receive information and that the domestic courts had failed to properly scrutinise the refusal in the light of the convention criteria provided in article of the convention which reads everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility compatibility ratione materiaea the parties argumentsi the government the government maintained that article of the convention did not guarantee the right of individuals to seek information owned or restricted by the state nor did it impose an obligation on the state to make such information available the right of access to classified data had to be interpreted narrowly due to the very nature of such information and to the right of each state to make sovereign decisions regarding restrictions on availability of information of national interest the issue of access to official documents was regulated by the council of europe convention on access to official documents of june and not by the european convention on human rights in the governments view if the right of access to classified information owned by the state were to be one of the rights guaranteed under article of the convention the court would be assessing the justification of such classification and of the denial of access to information and the proportionality of these rights which was not its task nor could the state be deprived of that right by a broad interpretation being taken of the convention moreover in the circumstances of the present case the court would need to apply article of the convention beyond what was prescribed by domestic law as well as what was decided by domestic courts which was not its task either the government furthermore claimed that there had been no justified purpose for the applicant to access the classified documents because accessing their contents had not been necessary for him to exercise his freedom to receive or impart information in particular he had never explained why those specific documents had been necessary for the writing of his book and nor had he shown their potential importance and connection to its topic moreover in his recent newspaper interview he had clearly shown that the records had been entirely unnecessary for his book since he had managed to finish and was about to publish the book in question even without having gained access to the documents nor did the documents pertain to matters of important public concern or affect the wellbeing of citizens or the life of the community at the same time they were not matters capable of giving rise to considerable controversy concerning an important social issue or involving a problem about which the public would have an interest in being informed more than twentyfive years had passed since the end of the war in the former yugoslavia numerous books and articles had previously been written on the topic and it was no longer relevant or at the centre of public attention the government furthermore pointed out that the applicant was a retired politician who had requested access to the classified documents to conduct research on his own initiative and in his own interest unlike the media and ngos his task had not been to report on matters of public interest nor could it be considered that access to the documents sought had been crucial to fulfilling that purpose lastly the documents sought by the applicant had not been ready and available as they had been placed at the highest classification level in the stateii the applicant the applicant maintained that article of the constitution guaranteed the right of access to information held by the public authorities although this was not an absolute right the state could not arbitrarily refuse access to such documents in the present case the applicants rights had not been breached owing to the fact that he had ultimately not been granted access to classified documents but by virtue of the fact that the impugned decision of the president of croatia did not demonstrate that an adequate proportionality analysis had been carried out in his case it clearly transpired from the circumstances of his case that he had requested access to the classified records for the purposes of writing a scientific publication on the creation of the croatian state and that he had consequently sought to exercise his right to freedom of expression the applicant furthermore stressed that under domestic law he had not been required to state the reasons for requiring access to the requested information lastly the applicant submitted that the information sought had constituted a matter of public interest he maintained that the process of the creation of the croatian state and the war had been and still was a topic of strong public interest and was incessantly being used in political campaigns although he was not a journalist or a member of an ngo the applicant considered that as a retired politician involved in scientific research on the issue of the great battle for the freedom of croatia he had proved that his work had not been motivated by personal gain also the information at issue had been ready and availableb the courts assessment the court notes that the question of whether the situation of which the applicant complained falls within the scope of article is to a large extent linked to the merits of his complaint at the same time the court has held that the question of the applicability of a convention provision is an issue falling under the courts jurisdiction ratione materiae and that the relevant analysis should be carried out at the admissibility stage unless there is a particular reason to join this question to the merits see denisov v ukraine gc no september it has also adopted this approach in cases involving complaints under article concerning the refusal of information requests see studio monitori and others v georgia nos and january and centre for democracy and the rule of law v ukraine no march given that there are no particular reasons to join this question to the merits in the present case the court shall examine the issue of the applicability of article to the present case before going into the merits of the complaint the court reiterates that article does not confer on the individual a right of access to information held by a public authority or oblige the government to impart such information to the individual however such a right or obligation may arise where access to the information is instrumental for the individuals exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression in particular the freedom to receive and impart information and where its denial constitutes an interference with that right see magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no november in determining this question the court will be guided by the principles laid down in magyar helsinki bizottság cited above and will assess the case in the light of its particular circumstances and having regard to the following criteria a the purpose of the information request b the nature of the information sought c the role of the applicant and d whether the information was ready and available the court firstly notes that the applicant sought access to the classified documents in order to use the information obtained for the purposes of writing a book about the creation of the croatian state under domestic law he was not under the obligation to state the reasons for which he was requesting access to the documents in question see section of the act on the right of access to information cited at paragraph above in the courts view it is not strictly relevant whether the documents were indeed crucial for his book what is sufficient is that the applicant sought access to them in order to provide his readers with a full and detailed chronology of the events that took place during the period referred to turning to the nature of the information sought the court reiterates that information to which access is sought must meet a publicinterest test which according to its general definition exists where disclosure provides transparency on the manner of the conduct of public affairs and on matters of interest for society as a whole and thereby allows participation in public governance by the general public what might constitute a subject of public interest will moreover depend on the circumstances of each case see for instance ibid in the present case the court notes that the constitutional court concluded that a scientific monograph about the creation of the republic of croatia was a matter of public interest see paragraph above it sees no reason to hold otherwise furthermore the court has accorded a high level of protection to academic researchers see başkaya and okçuoğlu v turkey gc nos and echr iv kenedi v hungary no may and gillberg v sweden gc no april and authors of literature on matters of public concern see chauvy and others v france no echr vi karsai v hungary no december and lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc nos and echr iv lastly despite the fact that any declassification of the documents may have been a laborious process involving several different authorities there is nothing to show that the requested records had not been ready or available compare and contrast saure v germany dec no october in sum the court is satisfied that the applicant as a former politician intending to publish a historical monograph exercised the right to impart information on a matter of public interest and sought access to information to that end under article of the convention no significant disadvantage article b of the convention as amended by article of protocol no to the convention provides the court shall declare inadmissible any individual application submitted under article if it considers thatb the applicant has not suffered a significant disadvantage unless respect for human rights as defined in the convention and the protocols thereto requires an examination of the application on the merits the government submitted that the applicant had not suffered any significant disadvantage in particular he had been granted access to thirtyone out of fiftysix classified records moreover he had meanwhile finished his book and had stated in an interview that the book would soon be published see paragraph above which meant that the refusal of access to the remaining documents had not prevented him from carrying out his scientific work lastly the applicants case did not concern an important matter of principle and had already been thoroughly examined by the domestic authorities including the constitutional court the applicant maintained that the damage that he had suffered could not be considered insignificant he had not had at his disposal all the information that he had required in order to be able to write his book this had caused him significant delays and had meant that he had had to conduct further research which had proved futile because he had been unable to find a substitute for the twentyfive documents to which had had been denied access it was true that he had already published his book owing to the importance of the topic and the interest of the public however as he had already stated in the interview see paragraph above submitted by the government a second updated edition of his book would be published if he were ever to gain access to the abovementioned classified records finally the judicial review of his case had been limited solely to procedure and not the substance of the decision on the denial of access inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor the criterion of no significant disadvantage hinges on the idea that a violation of a right however real from a purely legal point of view should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court the assessment of this minimum level is in the nature of things relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case the severity of a violation should be assessed taking account of both the applicants subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case see korolev v russia dec no echr however even should the court find that the applicant has suffered no significant disadvantage it may not declare an application inadmissible if respect for human rights as defined in the convention and the protocols thereto requires an examination on the merits or prior to the entry into force of protocol no if the matter has not been duly considered by a domestic tribunal see juhas đurić v serbia no june following the entry into force of protocol no on august see paragraph above the latter criterion is no longer required and the court may declare an application inadmissible on the ground of nonsignificant disadvantage even if it has not been duly considered by a domestic tribunal see bartolo v malta dec no september the court has already held that in cases concerning freedom of expression the application of the admissibility criterion contained in article b of the convention should take due account of the importance of this freedom see gachechiladze v georgia no july and be subject to careful scrutiny by the court turning to the present case the court does not consider the fact that the applicant ultimately published his book decisive for an assessment of whether he had suffered significant disadvantage as he explained the denial of access to the classified documents had caused him further research and delays in publishing his book moreover he considered his published work to be incomplete and was resolved to update it if he were ever to be granted access to the classified documents see paragraphs and above in any event in the courts view the domestic authorities application of the data secrecy act concerns important questions of principle regarding access to documents classified under domestic law and goes beyond the scope of the applicants case the court therefore concludes that given what was at stake for the applicant as well as considering the important questions of principle arising in his case it is not appropriate to dismiss the present application on the basis of article b of the convention consequently the governments objection in this respect must be dismissed conclusion the court notes that this complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merits the parties observations the applicant did not question the lawfulness of the interference with his right to freedom of expression however he could not discern which legitimate aim justifying the impugned interference had been pursued by the authorities refusal to declassify the specific restricted documents the applicant maintained that the domestic authorities had failed to perform a proportionality analysis in his case not having been granted access to the documents in question he could not have substantiated further why his interest in publishing his book would override the national security interest of maintaining classified data he further stressed that the information commissioner and the high administrative court had limited their respective subsequent reviews to verifying the lawfulness of the procedure without assessing the substance of the argument that it was necessary to deny access to the documents which he had requested in other words the domestic authorities simply assumed that the office of the president of the republic had performed a proper proportionality test the applicant was aware that the nature of the classified information did not allow the domestic authorities to give all the reasons that had led them to deny him access to the classified documents however in his opinion that denial could not be justified hypothetically and by using abstract reasoning when limiting an individuals rights the state had to show convincingly that it had examined in detail all requested information and had weighed the conflicting interests this could only be demonstrated if the subsequent decision clearly stated which specific aim had been pursued by restricting access to each of the documents at issue the authorities should also explain why it was necessary to restrict access to the entire documents and not only to parts thereof lastly the applicant submitted that one of the documents that had not been declassified by the president had already been made public in another book published in he deemed it odd that the state did not know that its classified documents had been leaked or had not investigated the issue further the government maintained that the interference with the applicants freedom of expression had had a basis in domestic law namely section of the archival material and archival institutions act read together with section of the data secrecy act they furthermore argued that the interference had also pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the independence integrity and security of the country the government also stressed that all the domestic authorities had weighed the conflicting interests of the applicant in being allowed to access the requested information against the interests of the state in maintaining the highest classification level for certain documents as in the case of bédat v switzerland gc no march the respondent state could not ex post facto provide proof that the disclosure of confidential information would have caused actual and tangible harm to the stated values protected by the classification of such information such a requirement would deprive the classification of such information of any meaning as regards the applicants statement that the classified documents had already been made public in another book in the government stressed that the office of the president had never declassified those records the government thus wondered how the applicant could have concluded that the documents that had been made public in were the same as those to which the applicant had sought access if the applicant had information that the publication in of the abovementioned records had been the result of unlawful conduct he was obliged to report it to the prosecution authorities the courts assessment in view of its findings above see paragraphs above the court considers that by denying the applicant access to the requested documents the domestic authorities interfered with his rights protected by article of the convention such an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression must be prescribed by law pursue one or more legitimate aims in the light of paragraph of article and be necessary in a democratic society the parties agreed that the interference in the present case had been in accordance with the law namely section of the archival material and archival institutions act the court can also agree that it pursued the legitimate aims of protecting the independence integrity and security of the country and its foreign relations although the applicant pointed out that it had been unclear which aim had been protected by refusing to declassify each of the restricted documents see paragraph above the general principles concerning the question whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the courts caselaw and have been summarised as follows see among many other authorities animal defenders international v the united kingdom gc no echr and delfi as v estonia gc no echr i freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society as set forth in article this freedom is subject to exceptions which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article iii the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts unlike a number of previous cases examined by the court which involved access to personal information relating to the applicant or other persons and the balancing of the right to freedom of expression against the rights of others compare magyar helsinki bizottság cited above centre for democracy and the rule of law cited above the present case concerns classified information relating to a sensitive part of croatias rather recent history which as the applicant maintained himself still formed part of considerable public debate see paragraph above national security being an evolving and contextdependent concept the states must be afforded a wide margin of appreciation in assessing what poses a national security risk in their countries at a particular time see mutatis mutandis liu v russia no no july and leander v sweden march series a no at the same time the court points out that the concepts of national security and public safety should be applied with restraint interpreted restrictively and brought into play only where it has been shown to be necessary to suppress the release of the information for the purposes of protecting national security and public safety see stoll v switzerland gc no echr v the court has recognised that it was not wellequipped to challenge the national authorities judgment concerning the existence of national security considerations see in the context of article of the convention janowiec and others v russia gc nos and echr however even when national security is at stake the concepts of lawfulness and the rule of law in a democratic society require that measures affecting fundamental human rights must be subject to some form of adversarial proceedings before an independent body competent to review the reasons for the decision ibid see also yam v the united kingdom no january if there was no possibility of challenging effectively the executives assertion that national security was at stake the state authorities would be able to encroach arbitrarily on rights protected by the convention see liu v russia no december and al nashif v bulgaria no june the court has further stressed that the fairness of proceedings and the procedural guarantees afforded to the applicant are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see baka v hungary gc no june in cases such as the present one involving national security concerns resulting in decisions restricting human rights the court will therefore scrutinise the national decisionmaking procedure to ensure that it incorporated adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the person concerned see yam cited above see also mutatis mutandis janowiec and others cited above fitt v the united kingdom gc no echr ii regner v the czech republic gc no september and the relevant council of europe materials cited at paragraphs and above turning to the present case the court notes that the applicant complained that none of the domestic authorities reviewing his case had conducted a detailed proportionality analysis weighing his interests against the public interest sought to be protected or at least that they had not demonstrated that such an analysis had been conducted the applicant further criticised the limited nature of the judicial review in his case the court has previously criticised the national authorities for their failure to conduct a thorough proportionality analysis in refusing to allow an individual access to classified documents see yuriy chumak v ukraine no march however unlike in that case the applicant did not claim that the withholding the classified information in the present case had lacked any legal basis nor has there been any disagreement between the authorities as to the reasons for refusing his request in the present case the applicant requested access to fiftysix documents from the state archive which had been assigned the highest level of classification under domestic law for a period of thirty years having consulted the documents in issue the office of the national security council advised the president of the republic to declassify thirtyone of them while it deemed that the declassification of the twentyfive remaining documents may harm the independence integrity national security and foreign relations of the country the documents requested by the applicant had thus been carefully reviewed by the owner of the information assisted by a specialised advisory body and for the most part the applicants request to access the documents in question had been granted the court further observes that on appeal the information commissioner as an independent body in charge of protecting monitoring and promoting the right of access to information also had the benefit of direct access to the classified documents see paragraph above and thus was able to review the substantive criteria contained in the executives order while it is true that only the owner of the documents in issue that is to say the office of the president had the power to alter the classification level the court notes that the information commissioner at no point disagreed with the opinion of the office of the national security council or sought to argue otherwise to the contrary she agreed with the presidents conclusion that the declassification of the documents in issue may harm national security and foreign relations of the country see paragraph above and found no abuse of discretion by the executive in addition she also noted that the applicant had failed to explain in his appeal why his interest in accessing that information would outweigh such crucial public interests ibid in the courts view nothing in the case file suggests that the competent authorities in the present case failed to perform a proportionality analysis it being a requirement under the domestic law see paragraph above moreover the applicants request for information had been carefully assessed by five different national authorities the requested documents were directly inspected by at least two of them the information commissioner having been able to review the substantive criteria of the decision to deny access see paragraph above according to section of the act on the right of access to information the high administrative court could have also been granted access to the documents in question see paragraph above the court further notes that the presidents decision refusing to declassify some of the requested documents was based on an opinion of a specialised body for dealing with national security issues and was ultimately reviewed and upheld by the information commissioner the high administrative court and the constitutional court in such circumstances the court does not find that the manner in which the domestic authorities assessed the applicants request had been fundamentally flawed or devoid of appropriate procedural safeguards that being said the court is cognisant that in the context of national security a sphere which traditionally forms part of the inner core of state sovereignty the competent authorities may not be expected to give the same amount of details in their reasoning as for instance in ordinary civil or administrative cases providing detailed reasons for refusing declassification of topsecret documents may easily run counter to the very purpose for which that information had been classified in the first place see mutatis mutandis regner cited above taking into consideration the extent of procedural safeguards provided to the applicant in the present case see paragraph above the court is satisfied that the reasons adduced by the national authorities for refusing him access to the documents in question had not only been relevant but also in the circumstances sufficient in view of the foregoing the court considers that the interference with the applicants freedom of access to information had been necessary and proportionate to the important aims of national security relied on and that the subsequent independent domestic review of his request in the circumstances had not been outside the states wide margin appreciation in this area there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention ii other alleged violations of the convention the applicant complained that he had not had a fair hearing as provided in article of the convention however having regard to the facts of the case the submissions of the parties and its above finding under article of the convention the court considers that it has examined the main legal questions raised in the present applications and that there is no need to give a separate ruling on the admissibility and merits of the remaining complaint see centre for legal resources on behalf of valentin câmpeanu v romania gc no echr with further references for these reasons the court unanimouslydeclares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention holds that it is not necessary to examine the complaint under article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on february pursuant to rule and of the rules of court renata degener péter paczolay registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the separate opinion of judge ktistakis is annexed to this judgment ppcrd concurring opinion of judge ktistakisi voted in favour of no violation of article of the convention in this case but on the basis of reasoning that differs from that of the majority of the court in particular firstly the applicant did not explain to the national authorities or to the court why while he had succeeded in declassifying thirtyone of the requested documents the twentyfive documents which had remained secret were so important for the documentary history he was preparing see paragraph all the more so since he has announced the publication of his book in the near future without these secret documents see paragraph the reasons for the significance of the secret documents could in fact be easily identified by the applicant because they were transcripts from sessions held in and by the defence and national security council of which the applicant had been a member see paragraph furthermore and secondly the applicant did not ask the high administrative court as permitted by national legislation see paragraph to inspect such information in order to assess whether there were substantial reasons justifying the refusal to declassify the secret documents because they might harm national security and foreign relations in more general terms i consider that in the light of article of the convention the court should not be prevented from assessing in addition to procedural safeguards the substantive reasons for a states refusal to declassify documents in so far as national legislation provides for this albeit to a limited extent as is the case with section of the croatian act on the right of access to information see article of protocol no and paragraph of the explanatory report to protocol no,,,
8,the applicant was born in and lives in sant angelo in campo lucca a the applicants circular letter in the applicant was practising law in september he sent a letter to the italian national legal service commission consiglio superiore della magistratura the csm in which he complained about the conduct of a judge x at the lucca district court he subsequently transmitted the content of that letter by means of a circular letter to a number of judges of the same court but without expressly referring to x by name the relevant parts of that circular letter read as follows before you receive any incorrect or untrue information before the corporatist spirit prevails over a correct interpretation of the reasons that drove me to write to the csm to the ministry of justice to the national council of notaries and to the national bar council about the conduct of two judges of the lucca district court in the context of a judicial partition procedure to which my clients were parties and before any of my colleagues come to apologise on my behalf for my initiative perhaps making out that i am insane or irresponsible my intention is to clarify and tell you the reasons which led me to do so an appeal on points of law is pending against a judgment of the lucca district court in which that court ruling against the claims by a female partner and deciding on the related issue of the partition of an inheritance asked the investigating judge to proceed with the sale of a flat which was the sole item of property to be divided between the heirs and which was occupied by the partner and her daughter an heir born to the cohabiting couple since the judgment of the lucca district court was not final it was not possible to proceed with the sale or to initiate the procedure relating thereto since this was prohibited expressly by article of the code of civil procedure the other heir however applied for the sale and the investigating judge in spite of our repeated requests for suspension of the sale which were all rejected brought about after two auctions without a buyer the conveyance of the property to a third party at the third auction here are the specific reasons for which all our requests were rejected in spite of this i would like to point out at the outset that i do not feel any animosity towards the judiciary and judges in general and that i consider by contrast that the role played by judges is crucial and irreplaceable for civil society there are and have been judges who carry out and have carried out their duties with great dignity and decorum decoro and who deserve my admiration and the admiration of all those who have worked in the field of justice none of us can forget y who died one can say on the battlefield i still remember that in the courtroom he was the one out of all his colleagues who even in his state of extreme and obvious suffering took the greatest number cases for adjudication and he carried on doing this until the bitter end i confess that if i had been able to spare him the effort in view of his condition i would willingly have taken over his workload but there are other equally deserving judges who work even during their holidays going to the office talking to lawyers and with whom we can have a form of collaboration and dialogue and to them i also express my esteem and admiration i am well aware that justice is done by men and precisely for that reason decisions may be erroneous and incomplete i still prefer however a human justice to one that is automated but what i refuse to accept is the idea that when the rights of the individual and the dignity of those whose task it is to defend him or her are at stake those rights could be decided upon in a partial manner perhaps with a display of arrogance or that a ruling could be given with total indifference and lack of commitment i personally believe strongly in the autonomy of the judiciary and i feel that without respect for the autonomy of the person whose task it is to decide it would be impossible to have dispassionate and fair judgments autonomy however can not be turned into an absolute discretionary power because that would be bordering on or tantamount to arbitrariness i have pointed out how i see the meaning of justice and reiterate that i think very highly of the duties exercised by judges and that my full admiration goes to those who act with dedication commitment and decorum decoro i am even envious of judges because they probably have more time to study and to dwell on issues and also to attend to other cultural and social interests than lawyers who by the nature and specificity of their work do not always manage to do things or to do things well i often take home things to read and to study and i end up midevening nodding off over a book after a busy day running from one office to another in the morning and answering the phone or receiving clients in the afternoon i also understand that the judiciary is burdened with work and with problems that the staffing is insufficient and the workload huge and for that reason it is true that protests esposti do not help to get the work done more easily and that more collaboration and dialogue would be better than protests there are limits however that in my view should not be passed and after thinking about this for quite some time i decided to submit this particular protest the letter to the csm i will now quote the last part of my protest in which i dwell on the meaning of the lawyers profession and ask whether it is legitimate that any decision or conduct should always be accepted this lawyer would point out as follows it is regrettable to direct this letter against individuals who even if they have different duties are considered by this lawyer to be colleagues as practitioners in law usually call each other he considers however that he is obliged to do so in response to a lack of commitment and total indifference towards the legitimate demands of the citizen in whose name justice is done with a belief in impunity as the position is one of power even though it should be seen as the discharge of a duty and last but not least a lack of respect for the dignity and responsibility of this lawyers profession this lawyer has practised law in courts at three levels of jurisdiction has borne very high costs on behalf of his clients to the point where if one were to apply the professional rate one would exceed the amount of the claim has sought in three statements of claim filed in the florence court of appeal a stay of execution under article of the code of civil procedure but his requests were all rejected by reasoning that leaves much to be desired but that is not the subject of this protest has accumulated a formidable pile of documents of all descriptions and has seen the attachment of funds in respect of his own claim go up in smoke in the time it has taken to work on these cases he could probably have dealt with fifteen ordinary cases of average complexity if work any type of work provided it is lawful has its own protection and its own dignity then the judge too more than any person as a result of his function and role can not but allow himself not to respect for the work of others including that of the lawyer as a legal practitioner this lawyer has a duty to provide some certainty to his client who is the citizen in whose name justice is done judgments are headed in the name of the italian people what certainty can the lawyer provide if each judge instead of applying the law gives his preferred interpretation and does not even explain his interpretation of the laws in question it should be noted that the system of appeals and claims is no guarantee for the citizen judges are only human and can make mistakes errare humanum est but they can not and must not wilfully make mistakes by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence and the citizen must have his or her claims upheld provided they are well founded from the earliest stage there are a large number of cases this can be explained by the fact that if many decisions had been taken correctly from the outset one could have avoided the proliferation of cases procedures and claims as can be seen here and not forgetting the many cases where the citizen disappointed and bemused to receive abnormal decisions having lost all confidence in the justice system decides not to appeal this entails a justified loss of confidence in the courts and an increase in workload and expense for the state because of the extra work for other judges registries and bailiffs and what justification and explanation could be given by the lawyer to this client to whom he had predicted a certain result with all due caution only to present a decision by the judge that is diametrically opposed to that which he predicted if that is the result of an error or a lack of knowledge or commitment or analysis on the part of the lawyer he should take responsibility for it but when this depends on the judge it is damaging to the lawyer because the client will necessarily have a negative opinion of the lawyers work are clients and citizens capable of understanding whether it is the lawyer or the judge who has made a mistake and to what extent if the lawyer does not obtain appropriate results with legal argument what other means are available what must the lawyer do to obtain something to which he is professionally entitled or should the lawyer not make life difficult for himself and carry on regardless tending to his garden il suo orticello while protecting his head from any tiles that might fall off the roof because on the one hand he is not protected and on the other he is at the mercy of another persons discretionary power without any regard for his own professional dignity when this letter reaches you i will be undergoing a medical operation i am sorry that for the time being i can not provide any further clarification or explanations to those who may wish them i am however ready if necessary to answer for my conduct and to provide any clarification that may be requested of me after my operation when i am in a better state of health again b firstinstance proceedings finding that certain expressions used in the circular letter had impugned his reputation x filed a criminal complaint for defamation against the applicant as x was a judge in lucca the file was transferred under article of the code of criminal procedure to the judicial authorities of genoa on february the genoa public prosecutor requested that the applicant be committed to stand trial before the court of that city x joined the criminal proceedings against the applicant as a civil party according to the charge in the circular letter the applicant had expressed admissible lecite criticism in so far as he spoke about interpreting and performing the work of a judge but had then overstepped the limits to his freedom of expression by writing the following sentences in particulara autonomy can not be turned into an absolute discretionary power because that would be bordering on or tantamount to arbitrarinessb in a partial manner perhaps with a display of arrogance or a ruling given with total indifference and lack of commitmentc the judge can not allow himself not to respect the work of others including that of the lawyerd judges are only human and can make mistakes but they can not and must not wilfully make mistakes by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence at the hearing of march the representative of the public prosecutors office stated that the applicant also had to be charged with proffering insults given that it transpired from xs statement that he had been one of the recipients of the circular letter in a judgment of february deposited in the courts registry on february the genoa district court convicted the applicant of defamation and proffering insults and sentenced him to four months imprisonment and to the reimbursement of xs court costs amounting to euros eur with reparation for the damage sustained by x the amount of that damage was to be fixed in separate civil proceedings the court nevertheless awarded x an advance payment provisionale of eur the district court observed that it was not in dispute that the applicant had written the circular letter and had asked his secretary to send copies to the judges in the civil divisions of the lucca district court during the proceedings the applicant had filed pleadings and had made spontaneous statements his arguments in defence had not however made it possible to disregard the offensive nature of the expressions used in the circular letter exacerbated by the fact that he was a lawyer in his letter the applicant had stated that he had the greatest respect for the judiciary and for judges who carried out their duties with dedication commitment and decorum but he was clearly not talking here about x who had been accused by the applicant of being arrogant and indifferent of believing that he was immune because he held a position of power and of having committed wilful mistakes by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence those accusations could be explained not by xs inaction in the handling of a case but by the decisions taken by x in a case where the applicants requests had been rejected instead of reiterating his legal arguments the applicant had overstepped the limits of his right to criticism alleging that x had erred wilfully thus seriously impugning the honour of the judge in question according to the district court the subject of the accusations contained in the circular letter could only have been x as shown by similar letters which expressly referred to that judge addressed by the applicant and his clients to the csm the ministry of justice the national council of notaries and the national bar council the applicants defence esimente of provocation article of the criminal code was not accepted even supposing that the decisions of x could be regarded as unfair acts the circular letter sent about four months after those decisions did not constitute an immediate reaction to them c court of appeal proceedings the applicant lodged an appeal he alleged among other things that the offences he was said to have committed were punishable merely by a fine that the sentence imposed on him had been disproportionate and that the advance he had to pay was excessive moreover in his complaint x had not mentioned that he himself had been a recipient of the circular letter thus ruling out the charge of proffering insults the applicant also argued that it could not be seen from the text of the letter that the criticism was directed at x and that this document when assessed as a whole was merely a manifestation of his frustrations about the shortcomings of the justice system in general lastly in the alternative he took the view that his defence of provocation was valid he argued that in the proceedings for the partition of an inheritance x had on a number of occasions rejected his requests for the suspension of a sale by auction of the flat in question and that xs decisions had subsequently been overturned by another judge at the hearing of march the applicant stated that it had not been his intention to offend x personally and he produced documents as evidence of his illhealth in a judgment of the same day deposited in the courts registry on april the genoa court of appeal ruled that no prosecution could be brought on a charge of proffering insults as there had been no criminal complaint on that ground and reduced the sentence for the offence of defamation to a fine of eur it stated that this sentence was fully remitted condonata and ordered the applicant to make reparation for the damage sustained by x which it assessed at eur and to reimburse xs court costs in the appeal proceedings eur the court of appeal observed that in the first part of his circular letter the applicant had recounted the tribulations of the partition proceedings in which x had taken the impugned decisions he had added that he regretted having to make complaints about certain individuals x and another judge whom even though they had different duties from his own he regarded as colleagues in addition the judges of the lucca district court giving testimony in the firstinstance proceedings had had no difficulty in identifying x as the addressee of the criticisms in the circular letter in those circumstances the applicants argument that the letter was merely a manifestation of his discontent about the justice system in general could not be accepted in the court of appeals view the decisions taken by x in the context of the inheritance partition proceedings could at most be regarded as erroneous but not as unfair the court also pointed out that one of the questions at the heart of the dispute the existence of inheritance rights in favour of the partner had been settled by the court of cassation differently from the applicants proposed solution the national bar council had in fact noted that the applicants letters could have been seen as a means of pressure against the judges concerned according to the court of appeal the applicant had not expressly challenged the part of the firstinstance judgment considering that the expressions contained in the circular letter had overstepped the limits of the right to criticise the applicant who had no criminal record had to be allowed the benefit of mitigating circumstances and under article of legislative decree no of see paragraph below the penalty for defamation was now a mere fine and not a custodial sentence the court of appeal observed that the distribution of a letter such as that sent by the applicant within a small court could not but impugn the dignity of the judge against whom it was directed and his image as an independent judge the expressions used by the applicant outside any procedural act sought to call into question the professional conduct of x who was portrayed within a restricted community as a partial and soft judge in the light of those considerations the court of appeal ruling on an equitable basis awarded the civil party eur in nonpecuniary damage d appeal on points of law the applicant appealed on points of law he reiterated his grievances and referring to a particular passage in his grounds of appeal stated that the court of appeal had made a mistake in asserting that the defendant had failed to challenge the finding about the offensive nature of the expressions contained in the circular letter in any event the judge had been required at all stages of the proceedings to verify of his own motion whether or not the criminal charge in question was made out in a judgment of november deposited in the courts registry on december the court of cassation finding that the court of appeal had given logical and correct reasoning in respect of all the contentious points dismissed the applicants appeal on points of law ii relevant domestic law article of the criminal code provides for the offence of defamation the relevant parts of that article read as follows anyone who in communication with more than one person offends against the reputation of another shall be punished by one years imprisonment or by a fine of up to eur defamation which consists in imputing a particular fact shall be punished by up to two years imprisonment or by a fine of up to eur defamation which is disseminated by the press or any other form of publicity or in a public document shall be punished by imprisonment of between six months and three years or by a fine of at least eur in the event of defamation against a member of a political administrative or judicial authority or one of its representations the sentences shall be increased legislative decree no of august article a gave jurisdiction to the justice of the peace in matters of defamation among others article a reads as follows in respect of offences within the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace the sentences shall be converted as followsa where the offence is punished by a sentence of imprisonment as an alternative to that of a fine a pecuniary sanction of between and lira shall be applied if the custodial sentence is higher than a maximum of six months the applicable sanction shall be the abovementioned fine or home detention of between six and thirty days or a period of community service of between ten days and three months the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant argued that his conviction for defamation had breached article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government challenged that argument a admissibility the court finds that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissionsa the applicant the applicant submitted that he had been convicted on account of a letter in which he had set out his thoughts on the different ways of interpreting and exercising the duties of a judge his assessments had not been interpreted in line with their real meaning and had been connected to a subject x who was not the actual target according to the applicant there was no evidence that he intended to impugn the reputation and integrity of x moreover the anomaly in the italian justice system whereby judges were not de facto accountable for their conduct had been underlined by many european decisions by books and by websites it was the court system as a whole and not x which had been the target of the applicants criticism the applicant further observed that genoa district court had given him a custodial sentence not prescribed by law and that although he had no criminal record he had not been granted general mitigating circumstances attenuanti generiche the applicant alleged that he had sent his circular letter to a number of judges at lucca district court solely to avoid undermining the reciprocal relationships of friendship and esteem between him and those judges and to protect himself against any distortion of the content of his letter to the csm he also stated that the conduct of x who had refused any attempt to reach a friendly settlement to the dispute had been driven by feelings of animosity towards himb the government the government took the view that the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression pursued the legitimate aims of the protection of the reputation or rights of others and of the authority and impartiality of the judiciary they argued that it was also necessary in a democratic society because the expressions used by the applicant in his circular letter had been offensive and had sought to denigrate x who had been accused in substance of deliberately and knowingly taking an unfair decision and of being arrogant lacking in commitment and indifferent x had thus been portrayed negatively and as a judge who showed total disregard for the fundamental ethical principles of his profession in the governments opinion the applicants attitude could not be justified in the light of the judicial disagreement which lay behind his animosity towards x in addition the court of appeal had acknowledged the existence of mitigating circumstances in the applicants favour and reduced the amount of the sanction imposed on him at first instance in the light of the foregoing the government took the view that in sentencing the applicant the domestic courts which were better placed than the international court to assess the facts and the necessity of the interference had not overstepped their margin of appreciation in such matters if there had been a violation of the convention it had been committed by the applicant who had unduly impugned the reputation of x protected as it was by article the courts assessmenta whether there has been an interference it is not in dispute between the parties that the applicants conviction constituted an interference with his right to freedom of expression under article of the convention see mutatis mutandis belpietro v italy no september b whether the interference was justified prescribed by law and legitimate aim an interference will infringe the convention if it does not meet the requirements of paragraph of article it should therefore be determined whether it was prescribed by law whether it pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in that paragraph and whether it was necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve the relevant aim or aims see pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark no echr xi and ricci v italy no october it is not in dispute that the interference was prescribed by law namely by article of the criminal code see paragraph above and article a of legislative decree no of see paragraph above the applicants conviction pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation and rights of another in this case those of x see mutatis mutandis nikula v finland no echr ii perna v italy gc no echr v ormanni v italy no july and belpietro cited above it also had the aim of maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary of which x a judge was a member see for example and mutatis mutandis kyprianou v cyprus gc no echr xiii foglia v switzerland no december july and sarl libération v france no echr and di giovanni v italy no july it remains to be ascertained whether the interference was necessary in a democratic societyc necessary in a democratic societyi general principles in order to determine whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society the court must ascertain whether it met a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article see janowski v poland gc no echr i association ekin v france no echr viii and stoll v switzerland gc no echr v the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they have delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation see fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state has exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole including the remarks held against the applicant and the context in which they were written see news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i in particular the court must determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify the interference are relevant and sufficient and whether the interference was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued see chauvy and others v france no echr vi in so doing the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities basing their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article see among many other authorities zana v turkey november reports of judgments and decisions vii de diego nafría v spain no march and pedersen and baadsgaard cited above in order to assess the justification for a given statement it is necessary to distinguish between statements of fact and value judgments the existence of facts can be demonstrated whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof see oberschlick v austria no july reports iv and in such cases a requirement to provide proof is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article see morice v france gc no echr the characterisation of remarks as statements of fact and value judgments falls primarily within the ambit of the margin of appreciation afforded to national authorities in particular the domestic courts see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no however even where a statement amounts to a value judgment it must have a sufficient factual basis to support it otherwise it may be excessive see jerusalem v austria no echr ii and ormanni cited above in addition the existence of procedural safeguards for the benefit of a defendant in defamation proceedings is among the factors to be taken into account in assessing the proportionality of an interference under article in particular it is important for the defendant to be afforded a realistic chance to prove that there was a sufficient factual basis for his allegations see inter alia steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii hasan yazıcı v turkey no april and morice cited above a particular aspect of the present case is that at the material time the applicant was a lawyer and his dispute with x had arisen in the context of his professional activity in its nikula judgment cited above see also steur v the netherlands no echr xi and fuchs v germany dec nos and january the court summarised as follows the specific principles applicable to the legal professions the court reiterates that the special status of lawyers gives them a central position in the administration of justice as intermediaries between the public and the courts such a position explains the usual restrictions on the conduct of members of the bar moreover the courts the guarantors of justice whose role is fundamental in a state based on the rule of law must enjoy public confidence regard being had to the key role of lawyers in this field it is legitimate to expect them to contribute to the proper administration of justice and thus to maintain public confidence therein see schöpfer v switzerland judgment of may reports of judgments and decisions iii pp with further references in addition in the case of morice cited above and the court observed that a lawyers are entitled to comment in public on the administration of justice provided that their criticism does not overstep certain bounds in order to protect the judiciary from gratuitous and unfounded attacks which may be driven solely by a wish or strategy to ensure that the judicial debate is pursued in the media or to settle a score with the judges handling a particular case b lawyers can not make remarks that are so serious that they overstep the permissible expression of comments without a sound factual basis and c remarks by lawyers must be assessed in their general context in particular to ascertain whether they can be regarded as misleading or as a gratuitous personal attack and to ensure that the expressions used had a sufficiently close connection with the facts of the case it is also necessary to take into account that the defamed party x was a serving member of the judiciary according to the courts caselaw the limits of acceptable criticism may in some circumstances be wider with regard to judges acting in their official capacity than to ordinary citizens see morice cited above however it can not be said that civil servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent to which politicians do and should therefore be treated on an equal footing with the latter when it comes to criticism of their actions civil servants must enjoy public confidence in conditions free of undue perturbation if they are to be successful in performing their tasks it may therefore prove necessary to protect them from offensive and abusive verbal attacks in the course of their duties see janowski cited above and nikula cited above it should lastly be reiterated that the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference see for example ceylan v turkey gc no echr iv tammer v estonia no echr i and cumpănă and mazăre v romania gc no echr xiii application of those principles to the present case the court notes at the outset that the applicant argued both before it see paragraph above and before the domestic courts see paragraph above that the criticisms in his circular letter were not directed at x but at the italian judicial system as a whole the court can not agree with this argument it observes in this connection that the letter in question see paragraph above contained express references to the letter that the applicant had sent to the csm to complain about the conduct of x and that passages from that letter had been quoted in extenso in addition the applicant summed up the main aspects of the judicial dispute in the context of which according to him x had taken unfair decisions of which the reasons were briefly set out the applicants circular letter was divided into two parts the first part contained an account of the decisions taken in the partition procedure the second contained considerations on behaviour from which judges should refrain and its consequences in the courts view even though the second part of the letter was drafted in the form of general considerations it can be interpreted only as a criticism of the conduct of the judge x who without being expressly mentioned is the protagonist in the account which constituted the premise of the applicants observations and assessments in those circumstances the court shares the findings of the district court and the genoa court of appeal see paragraphs and above according to which x was certainly the subject of the grievances set out in the circular letter it remains to be determined whether the remarks in question overstepped the bounds of admissible criticism in a democratic society it can be seen from the text of the circular letter see paragraph above that in substance the applicant reproached x on two accounts a for taking unfair and arbitrary decisions and b for being a biased judge and for having wilfully made mistakes by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence in the courts view the first criticism amounts to a value judgment as to the nature and legal basis of the decisions taken by x as indicated in paragraph above according to the courts caselaw the truth of such opinions is not susceptible of proof moreover they had a certain factual basis in particular the applicant had been the representative of one of the parties to judicial proceedings for the partition of an inheritance in the context of those proceedings the applicant had on a number of occasions sought to have the sale of a flat suspended and his requests had been dismissed by x on the basis of reasoning which according to the applicants subjective opinion was erroneous and contrary to the law the court therefore can not consider the first criticism to be excessive see mutatis mutandis morice cited above where the court found that criticisms made by the lawyer acting for the civil party about the conduct of the investigating judges during the judicial investigation were value judgments with a sufficient factual basis the same can not be said however when it comes to the second criticism namely that x was a biased judge who had wilfully made mistakes by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence this criticism implied that x had disregarded the ethical obligations inherent in the duty of a judge or even that she had committed a criminal offence the adoption by a judge of a deliberately erroneous decision could constitute an abuse of authority in any event the circular letter alleged that x did not have the qualities of impartiality independence or objectivity qualities which characterise the exercise of judicial activity however the applicant never sought to prove the veracity of the conduct attributed to x and adduced no evidence to show any malicious intent in the decisions that he contested in the courts view his allegations of misconduct on the part of x were based only on the fact that the judge had dismissed the claims he had submitted in the interest of his clients contrast morice cited above it is also noteworthy that the applicant who had referred a complaint against judge x see paragraph above sent out his circular letter without waiting for the outcome of the csm proceedings in defending himself before the domestic courts the applicant merely argued that his criticisms had not been directed at x in person see mutatis mutandis perna cited above and fuchs decision cited above see also by contrast nikula cited above where the court observed that the applicants criticisms had only concerned the manner in which a public prosecutor had discharged his duties in a given court case and not any professional or other qualities of the prosecutor in question the court however has already dismissed that argument see paragraphs above the court also takes account of the context in which the circular letter was written and distributed in this connection it would first note that the applicants criticisms were not made at the hearing or in the course of the judicial proceedings for the partition of an inheritance in that sense the present case can be distinguished from nikula cited above see in particular paragraph where the court found a violation of article of the convention the court further observes that outside the judicial procedure the applicant sent his circular letter to x in person see paragraph above and to many other judges at the lucca district court see paragraph above as the genoa court of appeal rightly observed see paragraph above the distribution of the letter within a small community such as that of a local court would inevitably harm the reputation and professional image of the judge concerned lastly the court notes that while it is true that at first instance the applicant was given a custodial sentence without the benefit of mitigating circumstances in view of his clean criminal record that sanction was replaced on appeal by a small fine of eur which moreover was declared fully discharged see paragraph above in addition that mitigation was applied by the judges at second instance see paragraph above and the amount of the compensation awarded to x eur can not be regarded as excessive the court would further observe that in cases such as the present one which call for a fair balance to be struck between the right to respect for private life and the right to freedom of expression it takes the view that the adjudication of the application should not in principle vary depending on whether it has been lodged under article by the person criticised or under article by the author of the criticism the two rights merit in principle equal respect see hachette filipacchi associés ici paris v france no july timciuc v romania dec no october and mosley v the united kingdom no may accordingly the margin of appreciation should in principle be the same in both cases if the striking of a balance by the domestic courts is consistent with the criteria established by the courts caselaw the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see palomo sánchez and others v spain gc nos and echr and mgn limited v the united kingdom no and january in the courts view there are no such reasons in the present case see mutatis mutandis di giovanni cited above having regard to the foregoing the court finds that the applicants conviction for the defamatory remarks contained in the circular letter and the sanction imposed on him were not disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued and that the grounds given by the national courts were relevant and sufficient for the purposes of justifying those measures the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression was necessary in a democratic society in order to protect the reputation of others and to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary within the meaning of article it follows that there has been no violation of article for these reasons the court declares unanimously the application admissible holds by five votes to two that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in french and notified in writing on june pursuant to rule and of the rules of court françoise elens passos päivi hirveläregistrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the joint separate opinion of judges wojtyczek and grozev is annexed to this judgment phfep joint dissenting opinion of judges wojtyczek and grozevtranslation we can not agree with the view expressed by the majority that there has been no violation of article of the convention in the present case the applicant submitted his complaint alleging a violation of his freedom of expression in the context of a conflict between the rights of two individuals namely between his own freedom of expression and the right of another person to the protection of his reputation moreover the majority have emphasised the fact that the interference with the applicants freedom of expression sought to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary of which x was a member there is no doubt that the need to protect the reputation of others justifies certain restrictions on freedom of expression a persons reputation must be protected effectively and any damage caused to it must entail a sanction in situations of conflict between rights the national authorities must carefully weigh up the rights in question and seek solutions whereby the rights are upheld to the highest degree possible in any event as the majority have observed any interference with a right must always be justified by relevant and serious reasons and remain proportionate to the aim pursued in its caselaw the court has identified a certain number of factors which must be analysed in order to determine whether a restriction on freedom of expression is justified see in particular von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr and axel springer ag v germany gc no february among these factors can be mentioned in particular the question whether the remarks in question contribute to a public debate the content form and consequences of the remarks the conduct of the person affected and the severity of the sanction imposed in the present case the reasoning of the judicial decisions delivered in italy appears not to have taken those various factors into account the italian courts confined themselves to establishing that the applicant had actually made the offending remarks that those remarks had been disseminated among the judges of the court in question and that they were directed at a particular judge in that court they further took the view that the remarks had overstepped the permissible limits but no analysis of the relevant circumstances as identified in the courts caselaw was carried out the methodology applied by the domestic courts does not meet the requirements of article of the convention as interpreted by the court in particular the reasons given by the national courts can not be regarded as satisfactory in terms of the requirement to give relevant and serious reasons in order to justify any interference with the right to freedom of expression in assessing restrictions on freedom of expression it is necessary to pay particular attention to the content of the impugned remarks and especially to consider whether the person concerned was mentioned by name and whether any conduct likely to damage his or her reputation was clearly attributed to that person while a false insinuation may have extremely serious consequences for the reputation of the individual concerned the fact that he or she is not expressly named may nevertheless in certain situations limit the effects of the remarks in examining the compatibility of an interference with the requirements of article of the convention it is also necessary to determine the actual consequences of the remarks to that end one must take account of the type of readership or audience for which the remarks are intended and in particular the number and profession of the addressees we observe that the domestic courts did not take these factors into consideration even though they were crucial for the examination of the case we also regret that the majority paid no heed to these questions we would observe that in the present case the applicant decided not to mention the judge expressly by name leaving a certain ambiguity about the identity of the person concerned moreover the conduct imputed to judge x was presented as follows wilfully making mistakes by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence the remarks combined observation of certain facts and subjective assessment of those facts the way in which the applicant expressed his remarks somewhat lessened their forcefulness we would also note that the impugned remarks were addressed to a restricted and specific readership consisting only of judges the general public were not informed of the content of the allegations disseminated to those judges in that context there are three major points to be highlighted firstly the various professional groups are often bound together by a corporatist spirit and solidarity thus affecting the way they perceive criticisms against their members secondly judges are naturally very wary about remarks that are not supported by convincing evidence thirdly judges are used to receiving complaints sometimes very aggressive ones from individuals who are unhappy with judicial decisions or indeed from their lawyers in most cases such complaints have no concrete impact on the image of the judge thus criticised these various factors related to the specificity of the readership considerably lessen the consequences of the applicants remarks it is questionable whether his letter had a real impact on the image of the judge concerned among that judges colleagues criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant and he was sentenced to a fine of euros for committing a criminal offence in addition the domestic courts awarded the complainant judge euros in damages which is a significant sum in our view having regard to the nature of the remarks made and the specificity of the very limited readership the sanction applied seen in the whole context is manifestly disproportionate in the circumstances of the case the majority justify the interference with the applicants freedom of expression not only by the need to protect a persons reputation but also by the need to maintain the authority of the judiciary in this perspective the interference in question was supposed to contribute to protecting the authority of the justice system in italy in our opinion on this point given the specific aspects of the case mentioned above the interference with the applicants freedom of expression is likely to have quite the opposite effect,,,
9,the applicant companies have their seat in kokemäki the first applicant company satakunnan markkinapörssi oy has been publishing veropörssi magazine since the magazine publishes yearly information about natural persons taxable income and assets this information is public according to finnish law several other publications and media companies also publish such information the editorinchief of the magazine lodged an application with the court in see anttila v finland dec no november in the magazine appeared times and each issue concentrated on a certain geographical area of the country data on million persons taxable income and assets was published which constituted at the time a third of all taxable persons in finland the magazine also published taxrelated articles and announcements the first applicant company satakunnan markkinapörssi oy has worked in cooperation with the second applicant company satamedia oy the companies are owned by the same persons in the second applicant company together with a telephone operator started an smsservice by sending a persons name to a service number taxation information concerning that person could be obtained if information was available in the database the database was created using data already published in the magazine since the second applicant company has also been publishing veropörssi magazine on an unspecified date the data protection ombudsman tietosuojavaltuutettu dataombudsmannen contacted the applicant companies and advised them to stop publishing taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in collecting data which was not to be published was not forbidden the companies declined because they felt that this request violated their freedom of expression by letter dated april the data protection ombudsman requested the data protection board tietosuojalautakunta datasekretessnämnden to order that the applicant companies be forbidden to process taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in and to pass such data to an smsservice he claimed that under the personal data act the companies had no right to establish such personal data registers and that the derogation provided by the act concerning journalism did not apply to the present case the collecting of taxation information and the passing of such information to third parties was not journalism but processing of personal data which the applicant companies had had no right to do on january the data protection board dismissed the request of the data protection ombudsman it found that the derogation provided by the personal data act concerning journalism applied to the present case as concerned the smsservice the data used in the service had already been published in veropörssi magazine and the act did not therefore apply to it by letter dated february the data protection ombudsman appealed to the helsinki administrative court hallintooikeus förvaltningsdomstolen reiterating his request that the applicant companies be forbidden to process taxation information in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in and to pass such data to the smsservice on september the administrative court rejected the appeal it found that the derogation provided by the personal data act concerning journalism which had its origins in directive ec should not be interpreted too strictly as it would then favour protection of privacy over freedom of expression the court considered that veropörssi magazine had a journalistic purpose and that it was also in the public interest to publish such data the court emphasised in particular that the published data was public the derogation provided by the personal data act concerning journalism thus applied to the present case as concerned the smsservice the court agreed with the data protection board that as the information had already been published in the magazine the act did not apply to it by letter dated october the data protection ombudsman appealed further to the supreme administrative court korkein hallintooikeus högsta förvaltningsdomstolen reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the administrative court on february the supreme administrative court decided to request a preliminary ruling from the court of justice of the european union on the interpretation of directive ec on december the court of justice of the european union sitting in a grand chamber composition gave its judgment see case c tietosuojavaltuutettu v satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy judgment of december grand chamber it found first of all that the activities in question constituted processing of personal data to which the directive applied moreover activities involving the processing of personal data such as that relating to personal data files which contained solely and in unaltered form material that had already been published in the media also fell within the scope of the directive in order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society it was necessary to interpret notions relating to that freedom such as journalism broadly however in order to achieve a balance between the two fundamental rights the protection of the fundamental right to privacy required that the derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of data provided for in the directive had to apply only in so far as was strictly necessary in conclusion activities such as those involved in the domestic proceedings relating to data from documents which were in the public domain under national legislation could be classified as journalistic activities if their object was to disclose to the public information opinions or ideas irrespective of the medium which was used to transmit them they were not limited to media undertakings and could be undertaken for profitmaking purposes on september the supreme administrative court quashed the previous decisions and referred the case back to the data protection board it requested the board to forbid the processing of taxation data in the manner and to the extent carried out in the court noted first that the term journalism was not defined in directive ec but that according to the court of justice of the european union it was necessary to interpret notions relating to freedom of expression such as journalism broadly however when balanced against the right to privacy any derogations to the latter were to be kept only to what was strictly necessary when balancing the right to freedom of expression against the right to privacy the court had found that the decisive factor was to assess whether a publication contributed to a public debate or was solely intended to satisfy the curiosity of readers the supreme administrative court found that the publication of the whole database collected for journalistic purposes could not be regarded as journalistic activity the public interest did not require such publication of personal data to the extent seen in the present case in particular as the derogation in the personal data act was to be interpreted strictly the same applied also to the smsservice the smsservice was shut down after the decision of the supreme administrative court was served on the applicant companies the magazine continued publishing taxation data in autumn when its content was only one fifth of the previous content since then the magazine has not appeared on november the data protection board forbade the first applicant company to process taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in and to forward this information to an smsservice the second applicant company was forbidden to collect save or forward to an smsservice any information received from the first applicant companys registers and published in veropörssi magazine by letter dated december after the data protection board had made its decision the data protection ombudsman asked the applicant companies to indicate what measure they were envisaging to take in view of the boards decision in their reply the applicant companies asked the data protection ombudsmans view on the conditions under which they could continue publishing public taxation data at least to a certain extent in his reply the data protection ombudsman stated that according to the supreme administrative courts decision the applicant companies lacked the legal right to maintain their taxation database and to publish it and reminded them of his duty to report any breach of the personal data act to the police by letter dated february the applicant companies appealed against the decision of the data protection board to the helsinki administrative court which transferred the case to the turku administrative court they complained that the decision violated the prohibition of censorship guaranteed by the constitution as well as their freedom of expression the finnish constitution provided better protection than the international human rights treaties as the latter did not prohibit censorship fully according to the domestic law it was not possible to prevent publication of information on the basis of the amount of information to be published or of the means used for its publication nor was it possible to use public interest as a criterion for preventing publication when preventive restriction of freedom of expression was concerned accepting that would mean that the authorities would be able to prevent publication if they thought that the publication did not promote discussion of a topic of public interest on october the turku administrative court rejected the applicant companies appeal it found that as far as the matter had been decided by the supreme administrative court in its decision of september it could not take a stand on the issue in the latter decision the supreme administrative court had stated that the case was not about the public nature of the taxation documents nor about the right to publish such information as the court was now examining only the decision rendered by the data protection board which was issued as a result of the supreme administrative courts decision of september it could not examine the issues which the supreme administrative court had excluded from the scope of its decision as the boards decision corresponded to the content of the supreme administrative courts decision there was no reason to change it by letter dated november the applicant companies appealed further to the supreme administrative court reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the administrative court they noted in particular that the decision issued by the data protection board had prohibited the processing of taxation information for publishing purposes as well as requiring that the internal registers of the first applicant company be protected in a manner required by the personal data act in practice the companies were prevented from collecting information for publishing purposes which meant that there was an interdiction to publish such information the companies noted that the finnish constitution also prohibited indirect preventive censorship on june the supreme administrative court upheld the judgment of the administrative court it found that the case was not about the right to publish taxation information as such nor about preventive censorship on these grounds and the grounds mentioned in the administrative courts reasoning the court found that there was no reason to change the latters decision ii relevant domestic lawa constitutional provisions article of the constitution of finland suomen perustuslaki finlands grundlag act no guarantees

convention provides inter alia article quality of data personal data undergoing automatic processing shall bea obtained and processed fairly and lawfullyb stored for specified and legitimate purposes and not used in a way incompatible with those purposesc adequate relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are stored the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant companies complained under article of the convention that their right to freedom of expression had been violated in a manner which was not necessary in a democratic society the collection of taxation information was not illegal as such and this information was public the decisions of the supreme administrative court meant in fact that the applicant companies were put under prior censorship while other newspapers had been able to continue publishing such information also a wide audience had a right to receive information article of the convention reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the government observed that the applicant companies application had not been lodged within the sixmonth timelimit regarding the first set of proceedings the present case involved two separate sets of proceedings as the subjectmatters of these two sets of proceedings were not the same the first set of proceedings concerned the question of whether the applicant companies had processed personal taxation data unlawfully and the second set of proceedings the issuance of orders for the processing of personal data consequently in their view in respect of the first set of proceedings the application should be declared inadmissible under article and of the convention the applicant companies argued that the initial aim of the data protection ombudsman was to obtain a publishing ban on the applicant companies this was not accomplished until the second round of the proceedings the proceedings could not be divided into two separate sets of proceedings with independent and separable domestic remedies in each the supreme administrative court had referred the case back to the data protection board in september that court could also have issued the ban directly without referring the case back to the board the applicant companies thus argued that their application had been lodged within the sixmonth timelimit regarding the first round of the proceedings the court notes that the first round of the proceedings ended on september when the supreme administrative court quashed the lower decisions and referred the case back to the data protection board as the case was referred back to the data protection board there was no final decision but the proceedings continued with the second round of the proceedings the domestic proceedings became final only on june when the supreme administrative court delivered its second and final decision in the case the court considers that as there was only one final decision there was only one set of proceedings although the case was examined twice before the different levels of jurisdiction the court therefore rejects the governments preliminary objection concerning the first round of the proceedings and considers that the complaint under article is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that this complaint is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissionsa the applicant companies the applicant companies noted that taxation data was public in finland and that anyone could have access to it in this respect the taxation data differed crucially from for example medical records finnish taxation data had been and continued to be published in newspapers and websites this activity had been the subject of profound discussions in the context of which the legislator had decided to maintain public access to taxation data publishing public taxation data had thus been accepted by the finnish legislator annually on november when the taxation records of the preceding year became public numerous newspapers and other media continuously published varying amounts of taxation data in printed papers and websites and this publishing was not in any relevant manner different from the applicant companies activities the applicant companies argued that there was no prescription of proactive limitations to the freedom of expression in the personal data act or in other legislation referred to by the government such limitations were as they should be retrospective the prohibition on processing taxation data de facto also prohibited the applicant companies from publishing it this publishing activity was also de facto the sole reason for the prohibition processing of taxation data was forbidden insofar as such data was to be published in other words collecting and publishing taxation data which was not to be published was not forbidden therefore the prohibition constituted a proactive ban also known as censorship which was strictly against the finnish constitution the applicant companies maintained that the personal data act did not prescribe restrictions to freedom of expression the act was not at all intended to be applied to such personal data which was to be published as the journalistic exception was to be applied to the personal data registers which were meant to support actual publishing however any possibility of limiting basic fundamental rights such as freedom of expression should be explicitly provided by law on the other hand the preparatory works of the act on the public disclosure and confidentiality of taxation information indicated that publishing even large amounts of tax data was accepted by the legislator the restrictions were thus not prescribed by law as to the necessity in a democratic society the applicant companies noted that publishing of taxation data was common frequent and expressly accepted by the finnish legislator they asked what the pressing social need was that demanded limiting their publishing activities while other newspapers and websites continued to publish taxation data in finland according to the government the matter was not examined as a potential limitation to freedom of expression but as handling of personal data to the applicant companies these two issues could not be effectively separated from each other in the way the finnish authorities had done in the present case prior to publishing data needed to be collected and processed this was done by practically all finnish newspapers it was true that the extent of the information published by the applicant companies was different to that practised by other publishers but the manner of publishing was the same taxation data was customarily published in catalogue form with few if any comments the protection of privacy had not during previous decades been a ground to prevent other media from publishing information on taxable income of ordinary persons the applicant companies noted that in the present case the limitations to their freedom of expression on the basis of the estimated general interest had been made prior to the publication the mere possibility of proactively censoring a newspaper on the basis of lacking general interest of its contents or on the basis of its contents in the first place was in the applicant companies view very dangerous for democracy the supreme administrative courts conception of journalism was in contradiction with that of the court of justice of the european union according to which it was to be interpreted broadly not strictly the content of journalism did not change with the amount of information publishedb the government the government argued that in the special circumstances of the case banning the applicant companies from processing taxation data did not constitute an interference with the applicant companies right to freedom of expression within the meaning of article of the convention were the court to have another opinion such interference was in any event prescribed by law and it was necessary in a democratic society the government noted that the impugned measures had had a basis in finnish law especially in various provisions of the personal data act these measures had been taken for the protection of the reputation or rights of others in particular for the protection of private life as to the necessity in a democratic society the government noted that the extensive publication in unaltered form without journalistic comments of individuals taxation data which was public as such had mainly satisfied the curiosity of the readers such processing conflicted with the personal data act the purpose of which was to implement the protection of private life and other basic rights safeguarding the right to privacy during the processing of personal data the public availability of taxation data in finland in general was exceptional in europe as many eu member states classified such data as private access to public information did not entail that such information could always be published but the publishing should always serve the interests of public debate the government observed that the case had been thoroughly examined by the national authorities and courts the supreme administrative court had assessed the matter in both sets of proceedings before it as a question of balancing the right to freedom of expression on the one hand and the right to private life on the other hand it had found inter alia that this assessment should take into account to what extent an open discussion of general interest and necessity in a democratic society or the control of public use of power or the freedom of criticism did not require the publishing of personal data concerning individuals to the now meant extent the government thus considered that the reasons relied on by the domestic courts were relevant and sufficient for the purposes of article of the convention the government considered also that the sanctions imposed on the applicant companies had been reasonable in its decision of november the data protection board had expressly stated that the first applicant company had been permitted to process personal data to the extent that the data had been used exclusively for journalistic activity and processed for journalistic purposes provided that the first applicant company protected the data appropriately furthermore the first applicant company had never been prohibited generally from publishing the information in question it could therefore if it so wished have changed its activity so as to comply with the personal data act moreover the matter did not concern prior censorship as it did not concern the right to publish taxation data as such but the handling of the personal data the case was not about a possible prior interference with the contents of the publication but about the assessment of the legal preconditions set for the handling of personal data with the aim of ensuring the protection of private life referring to the margin of appreciation the government considered that the domestic courts had struck a fair balance between the competing interests and that the impugned interference had been necessary in a democratic society there was thus no violation of article of the convention the courts assessmenta whether there was an interference the court notes that the parties disagree on whether the ban imposed on the applicant companies constitutes an interference with their right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the convention according to the government banning the applicant companies from processing taxation data did not constitute an interference with the applicant companies right to freedom of expression while the applicant companies claimed that it did referring in this respect even to censorship the court notes that in november the data protection board forbade the first applicant company to process taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in and to forward this information to an smsservice the second applicant company was forbidden to collect save or forward to an smsservice any information received from the first applicant companys registers and published in the magazine as a result veropörssi magazine published taxation data once more in autumn when its content was only one fifth of the previous content since then the magazine has not appeared the smsservice had already been shut down earlier the court considers that the prohibition issued by the data protection board did not prevent the applicant companies from publishing taxation data as such however it prohibited them from collecting saving and processing such data to a large extent with the result that an essential part of the information previously published in veropörssi magazine could no longer be published it must therefore be considered that there was an interference with the applicant companies right to impart information as guaranteed by article of the conventionb whether the interference was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim the court notes that the parties also disagree on whether the interference was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim according to the government the impugned measures had a basis in finnish law especially in various provisions of the personal data act and these measures were taken for the protection of the reputation or rights of others in particular for the protection of private life on the contrary the applicant companies maintained that the personal data act did not prescribe any restrictions to freedom of expression and that this act was not at all intended to be applied to such personal data which was to be published the journalistic exception provided by the act was to be applied to the personal data registers which were meant to support actual publishing the court notes that the right to impart information is subject to the exceptions set out in article of the convention the court accepts that the interference was based on the provisions of the personal data act as in force at the relevant time in the present case the question before the domestic courts was whether the journalistic exception provided by the personal data act was applicable to the applicant companies case in other words the question was whether in their case the domestic law as interpreted by the domestic courts allowed exceptions to be made from the protection of private life in favour of the freedom of expression the court therefore considers that the interference was prescribed by law and it pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others within the meaning of article c whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society according to the courts wellestablished caselaw freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article of the convention it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society this freedom is subject to the exceptions set out in article which must however be strictly construed the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly see for example nilsen and johnsen v norway gc no echr viii and lingens v austria july series a no the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with a european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article see janowski v poland gc no echr i the courts task in exercising its supervision is not to take the place of national authorities but rather to review under article in the light of the case as a whole the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation see among many other authorities fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction the court must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case as a whole in particular it must determine whether the interference in issue was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient see janowski v poland cited above news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i barfod v denmark february series a no lingens v austria cited above and sunday times v the united kingdom no april series a no in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see jersild v denmark september series a no the court further emphasises the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society although the press must not overstep certain bounds particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information its duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities information and ideas on all matters of public interest see bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii de haes and gijsels v belgium february reports of judgments and decisions i and jersild v denmark cited above not only do the media have the task of imparting such information and ideas the public also has a right to receive them see for example sunday times v the united kingdom no cited above the court has recently set out the relevant principles to be applied when examining the necessity of an instance of interference with the right to freedom of expression in the interests of the protection of the reputation or rights of others it noted that in such cases the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see axel springer ag v germany gc no february and mgn limited v the united kingdom no january in von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above the court defined the contracting states margin of appreciation and its own role in balancing these two conflicting interests the court went on to identify a number of criteria as being relevant where the right of freedom of expression is being balanced against the right to respect for private life see von hannover v germany no gc cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above namelyi contribution to a debate of general interestii how wellknown is the person concerned and what is the subject of the reportiii prior conduct of the person concernediv method of obtaining the information and its veracitycircumstances in which the photographs were takenv content form and consequences of the publication andvi severity of the sanction imposed turning to the facts of the present case the court notes that the applicant companies were not as such forbidden to publish taxation data in veropörssi magazine however they were forbidden to collect save or process taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in and to forward this information to an smsservice as a result the applicant companies published one more issue of veropörssi magazine in autumn with one fifth of the previous content since then the magazine has not appeared the smsservice had already been shut down earlier in order to assess whether the necessity of the restriction of the exercise of the freedom of expression has been established convincingly the court must examine whether the balancing exercise between the freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the court considers first of all that the general subjectmatter which was at the heart of the publication in question namely the taxation data about natural persons taxable income and assets was already a matter of public record in finland and as such was considered to be a matter of public interest from the point of view of the general publics right to receive information about matters of public interest and thus from the standpoint of the press there were justified grounds for imparting such information to the public the court notes that in veropörssi magazine published taxation data on million persons taxable income and assets these persons must have included both wellknown personalities and ordinary citizens according to the specific act on the public disclosure and confidentiality of tax information this taxation information is public in finland there is thus no suggestion that the published information was obtained by subterfuge or other illicit means compare von hannover v germany no echr vi on the contrary the published information was received directly from the tax authorities moreover the court observes that the accuracy of the published information was not in dispute even before the domestic courts there is no evidence or indeed any allegation of factual errors misrepresentation or bad faith on the part of the applicant companies see in this connection flinkkilä and others v finland no april the court notes that the only problematic issue for the national authorities and courts was the extent of the published information according to them the publishing of taxation information to such an extent as in could not be considered as journalism but as processing of personal data which the applicant companies had no right to do the central question thus turned on the concept of journalism as the derogation provided by the personal data act concerning journalism had its origins in directive ec the supreme administrative court decided to request a preliminary ruling from the court of justice of the european union on the interpretation of directive ec in that respect the court notes that the court of justice of the european union found in its preliminary ruling that in order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society it was necessary to interpret notions relating to that freedom such as journalism broadly however in order to achieve a balance between the two fundamental rights the protection of the fundamental right to privacy required that the derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of data provided for in the directive had to apply only in so far as was strictly necessary in conclusion the court found that activities such as those involved in the case at hand relating to data from documents which were in the public domain under national legislation could be classified as journalistic activities if their object was to disclose to the public information opinions or ideas irrespective of the medium which was used to transmit them the court notes that after having received the preliminary ruling from the court of justice of the european union the supreme administrative court found that the publication of the whole database collected for journalistic purposes could not be regarded as journalistic activity it considered that the public interest did not require such publication of personal data to the extent that had been seen in the present case in particular as the derogation in the personal data act was to be interpreted strictly the same applied also to the smsservice the court observes that in its analysis the supreme administrative court attached importance both to the applicant companies right to freedom of expression as well as to the right to respect for private life of those taxpayers whose taxation information had been published the court examined the case on the basis of principles embodied in article and the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the supreme administrative court thus balanced in its reasoning the applicant companies right to freedom of expression against the right to privacy according to the supreme administrative court it was thus necessary to interpret the applicant companies freedom of expression strictly in order to protect the right to privacy the court finds this reasoning acceptable the restrictions on the exercise of the applicant companies freedom of expression were established convincingly by the supreme administrative court taking into account the courts caselaw the court reiterates its recent caselaw according to which the court would require in such circumstances strong reasons to substitute its own view for that of the domestic courts see von hannover v germany no gc cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above lastly as concerns the sanctions the court notes that the applicant companies were not prohibited generally from publishing the information in question but only to a certain extent nothing prevented them from continuing to publish taxation information to a lesser extent than they had done in the fact that in practice the limitations imposed on the quantity of the information to be published may have rendered the applicant companies business activities unviable is not however a direct consequence of the actions taken by the domestic courts and authorities but an economic decision made by the applicant companies themselves it must also be taken into account that the prohibition laid down by the domestic authorities can not be considered as a criminal sanction but as an administrative one and thereby a less severe sanction than a criminal one contrast and compare lehideux and isorni v france september reports of judgments and decisions vii in conclusion the reasons relied on by the domestic courts and authorities were both relevant and sufficient to show that the interference complained of was necessary in a democratic society having regard to all the foregoing factors and taking into account the margin of appreciation afforded to the state in this area the court considers that the domestic courts struck a fair balance between the competing interests at stake there has therefore been no violation of article of the convention ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant companies complained under article of the convention of the length of the administrative proceedings which had lasted for more than eight years article of the convention reads in the relevant parts as follows in the determination of his civil rights and obligations everyone is entitled to a hearing within a reasonable time by a tribunal the government contested that argument a admissibility the government observed that the applicant companies application had not been lodged within the sixmonth timelimit regarding the first set of proceedings the present case involved two separate sets of proceedings as the subjectmatters of these two sets of proceedings were not the same the first set of proceedings concerned the question of whether the applicant companies had processed personal taxation data unlawfully and the second set of proceedings the issuance of orders for the processing of personal data consequently in their view the application should be declared in respect of the first set of proceedings inadmissible under article and of the convention the applicant companies argued that the initial aim of the data protection ombudsman was to impose a publishing ban on the applicant companies this was not accomplished until the second round of the proceedings the proceedings could not be divided into two separate sets of proceedings each with independent and separable domestic remedies the supreme administrative court had referred the case back to the data protection board in september that court could also have issued the ban directly without referring the case back to the board the applicant companies thus argued that their application had been lodged within the sixmonth timelimit regarding the first round of the proceedings referring to its conclusions concerning the sixmonth rule see paragraph above the court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissionsa the applicant companies the applicant companies argued that the entire period of eight years had been about the same legal question namely whether it was legal to collect process and eventually to publish taxation information in the applicant companies magazine it had been within the powers of the supreme administrative court to issue the ban directly without referring the case back to the data protection board this could have been done in the name of the applicant companies fundamental right to a fair trial within a reasonable time as guaranteed by article of the convention the applicant companies had not initiated these proceedings and in their view it bore little relevance of what these proceedings consisted the legal uncertainty concerning the publication of the applicant companies magazine had in fact lasted even longer as already on june the ministry of justice had initiated a criminal investigation concerning the publishing of the magazine the ministry had also requested a statement from the data protection ombudsman for the applicant companies this uncertainty had thus lasted for yearsb the government the government argued that the proceedings concerning the preliminary ruling from the court of justice of the european union had lasted for one year and ten months when excluding this duration the length of the first set of proceedings was three years and three months the criminal investigation initiated in had concerned a different subjectmatter to the proceedings now at stake the second set of proceedings had lasted for two years and three months the government noted that none of the procedural stages had lasted very long approximately one and a half years for each stage the case had involved two separate sets of proceedings as the subjectmatter of the two sets of proceedings was not the same in spite of the fact that the proceedings related to the same parties and the same facts the first set of proceedings had concerned the issue of whether the applicant companies had processed personal data in conflict with the provisions of the personal data act the supreme administrative court had quashed the appealed decision and referred the matter back to the data protection board which had to conduct a new administrative consideration of the matter and to make a new administrative decision the second set of proceedings had concerned the question of whether the data protection boards new decision of november had corresponded to the previous supreme administrative courts decision the government noted that the matter had been exceptionally demanding from the legal point of view the proceedings had included the drafting of a request for a preliminary ruling and there had been more hearings than usual in view of the particular circumstances of the case the proceedings had been conducted within a reasonable time within the meaning of article of the convention the courts assessment the court notes that the period to be taken into consideration began on february when the data protection boards first decision was appealed against and ended on june when the supreme administrative court gave a final decision in the case however the case was pending before the court of justice of the european union for a preliminary ruling for one year and ten months which according to the courts caselaw to be excluded from the length attributable to the domestic authorities see pafitis and others v greece february reports of judgments and decisions i and koua poirrez v france no echr x when deducting this duration from the overall duration the impugned proceedings before the domestic authorities and courts lasted over six years and six months at two levels of jurisdiction of which both levels twice the court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria the complexity of the case the conduct of the applicants and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicants in the dispute see among many other authorities frydlender v france gc no echr vii the court agrees with the government that there has not been any particularly long period of inactivity on the part of the authorities and domestic courts the proceedings were pending before the domestic authorities and courts for approximately one and a half years for each stage which can not be considered excessive the excessive total length seems to have been caused by the fact that the case was examined twice by each level of jurisdiction the court considers that even though the case was of some complexity it can not be said that this in itself justified the entire length of the proceedings some of this complexity may have been caused by the fact that the case was referred back to the data protection board for a new examination the court has frequently found a violation of article of the convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case see frydlender v france cited above having examined all the material submitted to it the court considers that even taking into account the complexity of the case the government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case having regard to its caselaw on the subject the court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the reasonable time requirement there has accordingly been a breach of article of the convention iii alleged violation of article of the convention lastly the applicant companies complained under article of the convention that they had been discriminated against visàvis other newspapers which had been able to continue publishing the information in question article of the convention reads as follows the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in the convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex race colour language religion political or other opinion national or social origin association with a national minority property birth or other status the government contested that argument admissibility the government observed that it did not appear from the case file that the applicant companies had relied on article of the convention as such or in conjunction with article of the convention before the domestic courts or authorities they had thus not exhausted the domestic remedies available to them and this part of the application should therefore be declared inadmissible under article and of the convention in any event the government noted that the situation of other publishers of taxation information was not comparable or analogous with that of the applicant companies as they had not published information in the same manner and to the same extent as the applicant companies the domestic courts had not examined the matter as one of placing different publishers in different positions but rather as a question of handling personal data in the applicant companies publications the conduct of the domestic authorities could therefore not be considered as amounting to discrimination under article of the convention taken in conjunction with article of the convention were the court to have another opinion the government considered that the difference in treatment had pursued a legitimate aim of protecting the private life of others and it had been reasonable to the aims pursued accordingly there had been no violation of article of the convention taken in conjunction with article of the convention the applicant companies claimed that they had made comparisons with other taxation data publishers before every domestic instance and that they had relied on both their right to equal treatment and freedom of expression they might not have relied on article of the convention expressly but they had certainly made claims and arguments based on their right to equal treatment when assessing potential limitations to their freedom of expression the applicant companies claimed that their complaint under article was admissible the applicant companies further noted that publishing of taxation data was common frequent and expressly accepted by the finnish legislator such data was annually published by numerous newspapers it was not restricted to persons of public interest but any person with taxable income exceeding euros was almost certainly mentioned in some printed national newspaper or on a national website none of this publishing had been restricted nor any attempt made to restrict it by any finnish authority article of the convention had thus been violated as the applicant companies had been prevented from publishing such information while the other newspapers and media had not the court does not consider it necessary to examine the governments preliminary objection concerning the nonexhaustion of domestic remedies as it finds this complaint in any case inadmissible for the reasons set out below the court notes that article of the convention complements the other substantive provisions of the convention and its protocols it has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms safeguarded by those provisions although the application of article does not presuppose a breach of those provisions and to this extent it is autonomous there can be no room for its application unless the facts at issue fall within the ambit of one or more of the latter see for instance eb v france gc no january and vallianatos and others v greece gc nos and echr the court notes that in the present case it is undisputed that the applicant companies situation falls within the notion of freedom of expression within the meaning of article of the convention consequently article taken in conjunction with article of the convention applies the court has established in its caselaw that in order for an issue to arise under article there must be a difference in treatment of persons in relevantly similar situations such a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification in other words if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised the contracting states enjoy a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a difference in treatment see burden v the united kingdom gc no echr turning to the present case the court notes that the applicant companies complaints under article of the convention relate to the prohibition imposed on them preventing them from publishing taxation data to a certain extent while other newspapers allegedly were able to publish such information the applicant companies are thus comparing their situation to that of the other newspapers engaged in publishing taxation information the court observes that the applicant companies were prohibited from publishing taxation data to the extent they had done in when they had published data on million persons taxable income and assets it is not known to what extent the other newspapers published such information nor is it known what was considered by the domestic authorities as an acceptable quantity to be published it appears that the applicant companies were never prevented from publishing taxation data to the same extent as the other newspapers but only to an extent which clearly exceeded the quantity published by the others the applicant companies can not thus be compared with other newspapers publishing taxation data as the quantity published by them was clearly greater than elsewhere and there is thus no point of comparison available the applicant companies can not therefore claim to be in the same situation as the other newspapers the court therefore considers that the applicant companies situation is not sufficiently similar to the situation of the other newspapers it follows that this part of the application is manifestly illfounded and must be declared inadmissible under article a and of the convention iv application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court finds that there has been a violation of the convention or the protocols thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party a damage the applicant companies claimed euros eur in respect of pecuniary damage for the loss of income for one year the government considered that there was no causal link between the alleged violation of article of the convention and the damage claimed were the court of a different opinion the applicant companies had not provided sufficient proof of the amount claimed therefore it could not be said that the damage complained of was actually caused by the alleged violation of article of the convention this claim should therefore be rejected were the court of a different opinion the question of the application of article should be reserved moreover the government noted that the applicant companies had not claimed any pecuniary damages in respect of alleged violations of articles or of the convention nor any nonpecuniary damages and that consequently no such compensation could be awarded the court does not discern any causal link between the violation found under article of the convention and the pecuniary damage alleged by the applicant companies the court therefore rejects this claim as to the nonpecuniary damage the court notes that the applicant companies have made no claim under that heading b costs and expenses the applicant companies also claimed eur for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and the court the government noted that it was not clear whether all costs claimed related to the present case moreover there was no specification related to all costs and expenses as required by the rules of court the government considered that the applicant companies claims were excessive as to quantum in their view the compensation for costs and expenses should not exceed with respect to the domestic proceedings eur inclusive of valueadded tax and with respect to the proceedings before the court eur inclusive of valueadded tax according to the courts caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum in the present case regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria the court considers it reasonable to award the sum of eur inclusive of valueadded tax covering costs under all heads c default interest the court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the european central bank to which should be added three percentage points for these reasons the court declares by a majority the complaints concerning the freedom of expression and the length of the proceedings admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible holds by six votes to one that there has been no violation of article of the convention holds unanimously that there has been a violation of article of the convention holds unanimouslya that the respondent state is to pay the applicant companies within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with article of the convention the following amount eur nine thousand five hundred euros plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicants in respect of costs and expensesb that from the expiry of the abovementioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage points dismisses by six votes to one the remainder of the applicant companies claim for just satisfaction done in english and notified in writing on july pursuant to rule and of the rules of court fatoş aracıguido raimondi deputy registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgmenta concurring opinion of judge nicolaoub dissenting opinion of judge tsotsoria grafaconcurring opinion of judge nicolaou in striking a balance between the applicant companies right to freedom of expression and the right to personal privacy of others under respectively articles and of the convention the supreme administrative court had regard inter alia to directive ec of the european parliament and of the council of october on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data oj l p this directive which aims at protecting individuals from the adverse effects of the processing and flow of tax data of a personal nature while at the same time enjoins states to provide exemptions or derogations in order that freedom of expression may also be safeguarded in furtherance of the public interest is itself sensitive to the need of getting the balance right see article of the directive as well as recital of its preamble article provides in this regard that member states shall provide for exemptions or derogations for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression only if they are necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing freedom of expression upon request by the supreme administrative court for a preliminary ruling on questions relevant to the interpretation of the directive in the light of the matters at issue the court of justice of the european union sitting in grand chamber gave a ruling the gist of which was a that the notion of journalism is to be interpreted broadly and therefore the activities of the applicant companies may be classified as journalistic but that it was for the national court to decide whether those activities were solely for journalistic purposes or in other words whether the sole object of those activities was the disclosure to the public of information opinions or ideas and b that any derogations and limitations were to apply only in so far as strictly necessary the supreme administrative court then proceeded with the examination of the case fully following the guidance received from the cjeu it concluded that in the circumstances the activities in question could not be regarded as activities pursued solely for journalistic purposes that the public interest did not in the present context require the publication of personal data to such an extent and that therefore the limitations in relation to the protection of data did not apply consequently it requested the data protection board to issue a prohibition this outcome entailed economic loss for the applicant companies basically in the form of profits the supreme administrative court did not include this aspect in the matters that needed to be taken into account in my opinion it was right not to have done so to have attributed importance to such loss would have been to envisage the possibility that protection under the directive might be defeated if the loss was high as could be the case where the infringement was on a particularly large scale while protection would remain only if the loss was relatively low i am not prepared to countenance that yet that is what the majority now do in paragraph of the judgment the loss allegedly sustained by the applicant companies is firstly viewed as a sanction against them in my view it was not a sanction then it is said that the loss is not however a direct consequence of the actions taken by the domestic courts and authorities but an economic decision made by the applicant companies themselves i am bound to say with respect that i am not quite sure what exactly that means but it certainly seems to effectively neutralize the idea of a sanction still the idea of a sanction is repeated immediately further down in the same paragraph the prohibition to publish is described as an administrative sanction and as such less severe than a criminal sanction but no further reference is made to financial loss i am unable to associate myself with this line of reasoning there was certainly an interference with the applicant companies right to publish however that interference was obviously justified as necessary and proportional on the basis of the balancing carried out by the supreme administrative court in the context of the applicable legal framework and in light of strasbourg caselaw having regard to what this case was about i consider that to have been enough as i have already indicated any loss sustained by the applicant companies was merely incidental to what was at stake it was not an integral part of the considerations that had to be balanced and could not therefore have had any impact on the outcome dissenting opinion of judge tsotsoria i dissent from the majoritys conclusion that there has been no violation of article of the convention in this case the core of this case is the right to freedom of expression in particular freedom of the press as exercised by the applicant companies the issue at hand was the restriction on processing lawfully available taxation data concerning natural persons taxable income and assets in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in when the applicant companies had published data on million taxpayers and forwarded this information to an sms service such taxation data constituted a matter of public record and a subject of public interest in finland see paragraph of the judgment freedom of expression is essential to a democratic society to uphold and protect it and to respect its diversity and its political social and cultural missions is the mandate of all governments article of the convention guarantees not only the right to impart information but also the right of the public to receive it see among other authorities ahmet yıldırım v turkey no echr and observer and guardian v the united kingdom november b series a no any measures interfering with the right of the media to convey information other than where limitations have been explicitly prescribed by law do a disservice to democracy and often even endanger it see mutatis mutandis fáber v hungary no july with further references therein with a certain degree of hesitation i align myself with the conclusion of the majority that the interference with the applicant companies freedom of expression was prescribed by the personal data act and that it pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others i also have doubts as to whether this case should have been analysed according to the criteria developed in von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr and axel springer ag v germany gc no february see paragraph of the judgment be that as it may after applying the abovementioned criteria the judgment concludes and i subscribe to this conclusion that the activities of the applicant companies which contributed to a debate on a matter of public interest raised no questions as to their compliance with the standards of responsible journalism and their good faith has not been called into question see paragraphs of the judgment the only problematic area for the national authorities and courts was the extent of the published information which would determine whether the activities of the applicant companies fell under the notion of journalism or processing of personal data which the applicant companies had no right to do see paragraph of the judgment the conclusion reached by the majority here served as the basis for shifting the balance from the applicant companies freedom of expression article to the protection of the private life of the taxpayers concerned article i do not consider that the judgment has persuasively ascertained that the prescribed limitations on processing and consequently publishing taxation data were necessary for the protection of the right to privacy of either specific individuals or of society as a whole therefore i do not agree with the majority that such measures were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued importantly the judgment does not follow the established caselaw finding a violation of article in cases where governments have taken measures to protect publicly available and known information on matters of public interest from disclosure see for example observer and guardian cited above and fressoz and roire v france gc no and echr i the judgment upholds the decision of the domestic authorities to restrict the processing of taxation data which have been openly available and in the public domain in finland under the act on the public disclosure and confidentiality of tax information thus affecting the capacity of the applicant companies to publish such data i consider that this restriction serves as a form of censorship that as such is incompatible with democracy moreover restricting the rights and duties of newspapers to purvey information that is already available on a matter of legitimate public concern has been held to endanger democracy and to be characteristic of a totalitarian regime as lord bridge put it in the observer and guardian case cited above the domestic authorities gave a broad interpretation endorsed by the majority of the concept of respect for the private life of taxpayers in relation to the processing and subsequent publication of their taxation data the decision by the supreme administrative court of finland to impose the restriction was made on the ground of the abstract and hypothetical need to protect privacy no negative effect or harm was identified as having been inflicted upon any individual nor had society been otherwise imperilled through publication of these data moreover the publishing of taxation data has not been considered to jeopardise the privacy of taxpayers in finland even though a number of newspapers and websites have continuously published such data see paragraph of the judgment without sustainable grounds to believe that the right of privacy has been violated or that an imminentreal danger of such a violation existed the imposition of severe restrictions on media freedom can not serve the legitimate interest of society regrettably the majority agreed with the respondent state that the applicant companies activities did not fall within the exception for the purposes of journalism in the personal data act see paragraph of the judgment it should be recalled that the inalienable elements of journalism are data collection interpretation and storytelling the judgment however could lead to an interpretation that journalists are so limited in processing data that the entire journalistic activity becomes futile this may be the case especially in circumstances where there are continuous efforts to limit freedom of expression particularly in the light of the dynamic and evolving character of the media the judgment does not follow the postulate that any interference with freedom of expression must be convincingly established and narrowly interpreted see for example hertel v switzerland august reports of judgments and decisions vi by limiting the opportunity to publish data already disclosed to the public the national authorities restricted the contribution of the applicant companies to debate on questions of public interest see sürek v turkey no gc no echr iv and morice v france gc no april another aspect of the judgment that may lead to further restrictions on freedom of expression is the linking of journalistic activity to the extent of the information published establishing a quantitative framework for publicly available information and limiting the freedom guaranteed by article on this ground does not correspond to the notion of a pressing social need it is vital that freedom of expression is safeguarded against vague and disproportionate interference such an interpretation of the term journalistic activities can not be in the best interests of a democratic society as understood in the caselaw of the court this interpretation also deviates from the approach developed by the court of justice of the european union to the interpretation of directive ec see paragraphs and of the judgment the court should have construed and assessed the journalistic activities of the applicant companies against the backdrop of the essential role played by the media including the press in a democratic society and the fact that all persons who exercise their freedom of expression including journalists undertake duties and responsibilities the scope of which depends on their situation and the technical means they use see for example handyside v the united kingdom december series a no the respondent state should not have been afforded a wide margin of appreciation in the particular circumstances of the case see for example fressoz and roire cited above and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii the question of the nature and severity of the measures taken by the domestic authorities is also a matter of concern in paragraph the court concludes that the interference by the domestic authorities with the applicant companies activities amounted to sanctions albeit necessary and proportionate ones i agree with judge nicolaous view as expressed in his concurring opinion that they were not sanctions as such contrast and compare with weber v switzerland may series a no öztürk v turkey gc no echr vi and özgür gündem v turkey no echr iii nonetheless the decisions of the domestic authorities entailed an extremely serious interference with the applicant companies activities in practice while publishing as such was not prohibited the domestic authorities decisions prevented the applicant companies to a certain extent from processing data for publishing purposes this led to futile attempts to continue publishing such data as a result the measures imposed not only limited the companies participation in and contribution to debate on matters of legitimate concern see for example lingens v austria no july bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above and mosley v the united kingdom no may but also led to the discontinuation of publication in addition this would inevitably have had financial consequences for the applicant companies hence the severity of the measures imposed should have played a role in the proportionality analysis in the light of the foregoing and given the interest a democratic society has in ensuring and preserving freedom of the press i believe that the national authorities in the particular circumstances of the case did not apply standards in conformity with the principles embodied in article of the convention and overstepped the margin of appreciation afforded to them consequently the court should have exercised its supervisory function and should have concluded that the interference with the applicant companies right to freedom of expression was not necessary in a democratic society this should have resulted in an award of just satisfaction to the applicant companies under article of the convention european charter on freedom of the press b van der haak m parks m castells the future of journalism networked

10,in and lives in kragujevac at the relevant time he was an editorinchief of svetlost a weekly news magazine based in the same city the applicant was represented by ms d rakićević a lawyer practising in kragujevac the government were represented by their agent ms z jadrijević mladar the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows the published article on august svetlost published an article entitled the citys chief undertaker ccu mr a from a smuggler to a rich man glavni gradski grobar gggr g a od švercera do bogatuna the subtitle just below states that before you decide to die ask ccu as to whether you can do so since in kragujevac only the privileged have this right pre nego što odlučite da umrete pitajte gggr da li možete to da uradite jer u kragujevcu to pravo imaju samo privilegovani the article itself written by ms b a journalist employed with svetlost in so far as referred to by the domestic courts reads as follows in connection with an earlier case allegedly involving the building of a family crypt in the centre of the kragujevac cemetery by a local businessman referred to as pharaoh a case which greatly agitated the citizens of kragujevac because of the digging up of multiple existing graves ccu stated that all this was lawful and marketbased enforcing discipline against the dead and calling out the living for their debts ccu just like any other debt enforcer started issuing threats of a most bizarre nature which this journalist can not now convey for the sake of decency if we were a state based on the rule of law and a civil society this man would have to be removed from his position immediately for not being up to it both as a person and professionally instead walking bravely in his gianfranco ferré shoes he is successfully leading the citys public burial company although ccus career seems fantastic it was not easy to travel for such a short time the road from being a transitional loser and a cigarette smuggler to being a person wearing gianfranco ferré shoes and living the high life at a time when thousands of experts and hard workers were losing their jobs ccu went in another direction and from an ordinary worker three years of vocational school and a street cigarette smuggler became a director of the citys cemetery about whose high income both official and more often unofficial under the counter there are fantastical stories being told throughout the city through the constant increase in the price of death and personal human tragedy ccu is building his successful career at the time when the case referred to in paragraph of this article happened ccu left one political party and joined another one whose boss ordered him to sell to the kragujevac pharaoh the centre of the old city cemetery leaving nothing to chance ccu managed to secure for himself two diplomas just in case they were needed they may come in handy and it sounds better when introducing oneself as part of the above article there was also a photograph of mr a referred to by his name and surname and an explanation that it was taken on the occasion of a public presentation of a book about graveyards promocija monografije o grobljima the civil proceedings in august mr a lodged a civil defamation claim against the applicant ms b and svetlost regarding the published article and the said photograph on september the kragujevac high court viši sud u kragujevcu ruled partly in favour of mr a and ordered the applicant ms b and svetlost to pay him jointly i serbian dinars rsd equivalent to approximately euros eur at the time on account of the mental anguish which he had suffered as a consequence of the breach of his honour and reputation ii rsd equivalent to approximately eur at the time for the violation of his right to privacy and iii rsd in litigation costs equivalent to approximately eur at the time all with statutory interest as of the date of adjudication the kragujevac high court explained inter alia that there had been no justified interest for the public to be informed about mr as private life including as regards how he had opted to dress in any event according to his own statement which the court accepted mr a had never worn italian shoes and had properly obtained his diplomas he had however used to sell cigarettes for a while the respondents had furthermore failed to verify the other allegations against mr a thus harming his honour and his reputation in particular the court could not accept that the allegations regarding the functioning of the public burial company had been based on a press conference which had taken place in or on statements which had been given by a number of its former employees as suggested by the respondents since there was no evidence in support of those claims in fact the witnesses including the mayor personally who had been heard in the course of the proceedings all explicitly stated otherwise following the publication of the article mr a had been contacted by many friends colleagues and business partners as well as by the mayor they had all wanted to know whether the allegations contained in the article were accurate which in turn had caused him great mental anguish the respondents had likewise failed to obtain the consent of mr a for the publication of the photograph in question the remaining text including the title and the subtitle amounted to a mixture of value judgments and unverified statements of fact which had been intended to belittle mr as person in breach of the relevant journalistic and ethical standards on december the kragujevac appeals court apelacioni sud u kragujevcu upheld the kragujevac high courts ruling as regards the compensation which had been awarded to mr a on account of the mental anguish suffered due to the breach of his honour and his reputation at the same time however the appellate court rejected altogether mr as claim for compensation regarding the violation of his privacy in connection with the photograph which had been published as part of the article and amended the amount which had been awarded for litigation costs to rsd equivalent to approximately eur at the time in its reasoning which was otherwise essentially along the lines of the reasons which had been offered at first instance the kragujevac appeals court pointed out inter alia that mr a was not entitled to any compensation for the alleged violation of his privacy since he had been a public function holder and the photograph in question had been taken during a public event related to the performance of his duties mr as consent had therefore not been necessary for its publication the above rulings relied on inter alia some of the relevant provisions of the obligations act and the public information act summarised in paragraphs and below the proceedings before the constitutional court on february the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal ustavnu žalbu against the kragujevac appeals courts judgment of december on february the constitutional court ustavni sud dismissed the appeal and in so doing endorsed the reasoning of the kragujevac appeals court

instance osnovni sud u kragujevcu on the basis of the civil judgments of september and december respectively see paragraphs and above on the same day the kragujevac court of first instance issued the enforcement order rešenje o izvršenju on july the kragujevac appeals court upheld this decision at second instance on may however mr a withdrew his enforcement request in respect of the applicant and the other two respondents he did so before the kragujevac court of first instance as part of a separate criminal case which he had brough against ms b regarding the same article and furthermore renounced his right odrekao se prava to reinstitute the enforcement proceedings at any point subsequently this declaration was also accepted by ms bs defence counsel in the criminal proceedings on the same occasion mr a dropped his criminal charges against ms b and the criminal case itself was thus concluded on february the kragujevac court of first instance discontinued the enforcement proceedings mr a having taken no steps to have the civil judgments in question enforced since march relevant legal frameworkthe obligations act zakon o obligacionim odnosima published in the official gazette of

concerned accusations involving the commission of a criminal offence this act was subsequently amended through decisions rendered by the constitutional court but was ultimately repealed and replaced by other legislation in the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that he had suffered a breach of his freedom of expression in particular he maintained i that the printed article in question legitimately raised serious issues to do with the functioning of a staterun public utility company as well as the alleged malfeasance andor corruption on the part of its director and ii that he had ultimately ended up being punished for the articles publication by losing a civil defamation case and being ordered to pay compensation plus costs to mr a article of the convention in so far as relevant reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to impart information and ideas without interference by public authority the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the government maintained that given that the civil court judgments rendered against the applicant have not been enforced he could no longer claim to be a victim of the violation alleged the applicant disagreed it is the settled caselaw of the court that the word victim in the context of article of the convention denotes the person directly affected by the act or omission at issue the existence of a violation of the convention being conceivable even in the absence of prejudice prejudice is relevant only in the context of article consequently a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a victim unless the national authorities have acknowledged either expressly or in substance and then afforded redress for the breach of the convention see for example nada v switzerland gc no echr with further references turning to the present case the court observes that quite apart from the issue of redress the domestic authorities have never acknowledged either expressly or in substance the violation of the convention alleged by the applicant accordingly the applicant may still claim to be a victim of a breach of his rights under article of the convention and the governments objection in this regard must be dismissed the court furthermore notes that the application is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any of the other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merits the parties submissionsa the applicant the applicant reaffirmed his complaint he furthermore added that the article consisted of a combination of statements of facts and value judgments ms b had also carried out proper research before its publication and had enquired with the management of the citys cemetery for information concerning the price of a burial plot while pretending to be interested in buying one the management however had been concealing information and avoiding transparency the public had nevertheless learned about several cases involving the resale of burial plots where the mortal remains of people who had passed away long ago and whose relatives had either died or had left the country had been removed and the plots then resold to the newlyrich who had gained their wealth by doing business in the grey zone or even by engaging in crime the applicant maintained that mr a had been a public official and had therefore had to endure more criticism particularly since the article focused on an important local issue mr a had likewise never disputed that at one time he had in fact been smuggling cigarettes which had itself always been an illegal activity while in his s mr a had furthermore obtained his diplomas in the shortest possible time and at a private university which had been linked to multiple scandals involving the printing of diplomas as for the possibility to refute the allegations contained in the article mr a could have done so but had opted instead in favour of a civil defamation lawsuit lastly the applicant argued that the statement of may to the effect that mr a had apparently wanted to withdraw his enforcement request see paragraph above had had no legal effect as it had been given in the criminal context and not as part of the pending enforcement proceedings it was furthermore unclear as to whether mr as counsel had even had the authorisation to do so on behalf of his client and the applicable enforcement regulations themselves had not envisaged such a possibility in any event the enforcement request had never been withdrawn in the enforcement proceedings nor had the enforcement judge been informed of what had transpired in the criminal context ultimately the enforcement proceedings had been discontinued only because mr a had not informed the enforcement judge as to how he would have liked to proceed with the case see paragraph above hence mr a could have reinstituted the enforcement proceedings at any point in the meantime however the applicant had been subjected to public humiliation and emotional distress since inter alia enforcement officers had come to his home on several occasions had made an inventory of his property and had even threatened to seize it up until it had become clear that the applicants assets were insufficient to cover the judgment debtb the government the government endorsed the reasoning of the civil courts see paragraphs and above and maintained that there had been no violation of article in the present case in particular the interference with the applicants freedom of expression had been in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation of others admittedly mr a had been a public figure and the limits of acceptable criticism had thus been broader in his case than with respect to a private individual but even so there had to be some reasonable limits applicable the article had also contained a series of false claims concerning mr as private and professional life which claims had not been properly verified before being published the government reiterated that even where allegations are pure value judgments rather than statements of fact they must still have some factual basis or be deemed as not being in accordance with article of the convention in any event the general tone of the article had been such that it had been clearly intended to belittle mr a and portray him as a dishonest and immoral person prone to breaking the law none of which had been proved in the course of the civil proceedings furthermore even though ms b had communicated with the public burial company for research purposes and regarding the lease of a burial plot she had not obtained a statement from mr a personally before the publication of the article and had tried to reach him only once there had in any event been no attempt to conceal any information from ms b and the amount of compensation awarded to mr a had not been disproportionate finally the government argued that the applicant had not suffered any adverse consequences since the civil judgments in question had not been enforced in particular on may mr a had withdrawn his enforcement request and had renounced his right to have the enforcement proceedings reinstituted subsequently see paragraph above moreover this declaration had also been accepted by ms bs representative personally see paragraphs and above and on february the kragujevac court of first instance had itself discontinued the enforcement proceedings see paragraph above in any event after december the civil judgments could not have been enforced based on the relevant provisions of the obligations act see paragraph above the courts assessmenta existence of an interference it is not disputed between the parties that the final civil judgment rendered against the applicant as an editorinchief by the kragujevac appeals court on december amounted to an interference by a public authority with his right to freedom of expression see paragraph above see also mutatis mutandis lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc nos and and echr iv orban and others v france no january with further references and gutiérrez suárez v spain no and june as regards the situation of authors as well as publishers publication directors and editors responsible for their publications it is however understood that the publication of mr as photograph in the impugned article was not ultimately deemed to amount to a violation of his privacy by the said appellate court which was why the applicant clearly suffered no interference with his freedom of expression on this account in particular see paragraph above in fine an interference with ones freedom of expression will infringe the convention unless it satisfies the requirements of paragraph of article it must therefore be determined whether it was prescribed by law pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in that paragraph and was necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve those aimsb whether the interference was prescribed by law the court notes that the legal basis for the adoption of the final civil judgement in question was inter alia the relevant provisions of the public information act and the obligations act see paragraphs and above the court finds that these provisions were both adequately accessible and foreseeable that is to say that they were formulated with sufficient precision to enable an individual if need be with appropriate advice to regulate his or her conduct see for example and among many other authorities the sunday times v the united kingdom no april series a no and karácsony and others v hungary gc nos and may see also in the serbian context tešić v serbia nos and february the court therefore concludes that the interference at issue was prescribed by law within the meaning of article of the conventionc whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim in agreement with the position of the domestic courts the government argued that the interference in question had pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation or rights of others the court finds no reason to hold otherwise and accepts therefore that the interference with the applicants freedom of expression pursued one of the legitimate aims envisaged under article of the conventiond necessary in a democratic societyi general principles the court refers to the general principles for assessing the necessity of an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression as set out in morice v france gc no echr bédat v switzerland gc no march and medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june the court has also held in numerous cases that a lack of relevant and sufficient reasoning on the part of the national courts or a failure to consider the applicable standards in assessing the interference in question will entail a violation of article see among many other authorities scharsach and news verlagsgesellschaft v austria no echr xi uj v hungary no and july and mariya alekhina and others v russia no july it should furthermore be reiterated that the right to protection of reputation is a right which is guaranteed under article of the convention as part of the right to respect for private life see for instance denisov v ukraine gc no september in order for article to come into play an attack on a persons reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be carried out in a manner causing prejudice to the personal enjoyment of ones right to respect for his or her private life see axel springer ag v germany gc no february medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above and beizaras and levickas v lithuania no january in instances where in accordance with the criteria set out above the interests of the protection of the reputation or rights of others bring article into play the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance when protecting the two values guaranteed by the convention namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above the general principles applicable to the balancing of these rights were first set out in von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr and axel springer ag cited above then restated in more detail in couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no echr extracts and more recently summarised in medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above lastly the court has held that the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity and scope of any interference in the freedom of expression protected by article of the convention where the national authorities have weighed up the interests at stake in compliance with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw strong reasons are required if it is to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see bédat cited above with further references the relevant criteria when it comes to the balancing exercise between the rights protected under article and article of the convention include a the contribution made by the article in question to a debate of public interest b how well known is the person concerned and what is the subject of the report c the conduct of the person concerned prior to the publication of the article d the method of obtaining the information and its veracity e the content form and consequences of the publication and f the severity of the sanction imposed see for example axel springer ag cited above and milisavljević v serbia no april of course some of the above criteria may have more or less relevance given the particular circumstances of a given case see satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june and other relevant criteria may also be taken into account depending on the situation see axel springer se and rtl television gmb h v germany no september ii application of these principles to the present case in assessing the relevant statements contained in the published article and the reasons given in the domestic civil judgments to justify the interference with the applicants freedom of expression the court finds the following issues of particular relevance having regard to the criteria identified in paragraphs and above whether the statements in question made a contribution to a debate of public interest whether mr a can be considered a public figure the content and form of the information contained in the article and lastly the consequences of the publication of the article in respect of mr a and the severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant himselfα whether the article made a contribution to a debate of public interest the public interest ordinarily relates to matters which affect the public to such an extent that it may legitimately take an interest in them which attract its attention or which concern it to a significant degree especially in that they affect the wellbeing of citizens or the life of the community this is also the case with regard to matters which are capable of giving rise to considerable controversy which concern an important social issue or which involve a problem that the public would have an interest in being informed about see among others satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above with this in mind the court considers that the published article in the present case clearly concerned an issue of public interest in so far as it referred to the functioning of a public burial company entrusted with the management of the kragujevac citys cemetery the domestic civil courts for their part agreed with this by noting that there had been no justified interest for the public to be informed of mr as private life but then going on to carry out an analysis of the allegations to do with the functioning of the public burial company see paragraphs and aboveβ whether mr a can be considered a public figure the court reiterates that a distinction has to be made between private individuals and persons acting in a public context as political or public figures accordingly whilst a private individual unknown to the public may claim particular protection of his or her right to private life the same is not true of public figures see minelli v switzerland dec no june petrenco v moldova no march and milisavljević cited above in respect of whom the limits of critical comment are wider as they are inevitably and knowingly exposed to public scrutiny and must therefore display a particularly high degree of tolerance see kuliś v poland no march ayhan erdoğan v turkey no january and milisavljević cited above persons may in this context be considered as public figures based on inter alia their acts andor position through which they have entered the public arena see kapsis and danikas v greece no january with further references as well as in view of the institutional dimension and importance of their duties see for example chalabi v france no september in their observations both parties agreed that mr a had been a public figure within the meaning of article of the convention at the material time see paragraphs and above as did the civil courts in their judgments rendered earlier see paragraph above in particular given the above caselaw on the issue and the fact that mr a had in fact been responsible for the management and operation of an important public utility company the court finds no reason to disagree and concludes that as a public figure mr a had to show in general a greater degree of tolerance than a private individual faced with criticism in a printed publicationγ the content and form of the information contained in the article the court would stress that in the context of freedom of expression it draws a distinction between statements of fact and value judgments the existence of facts can be demonstrated whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article however where a statement amounts to a value judgment the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement if there is not that value judgment may prove excessive in order to distinguish between a factual allegation and a value judgment it is necessary to take account of the circumstances of the case and the general tone of the remarks bearing in mind that assertions about matters of public interest may on that basis constitute value judgments rather than statements of fact see for instance morice cited above with further references being mindful of the above and as regards the present case the court notes that the article see paragraph above reads inter alia as follows at a time when thousands of experts and hard workers were losing their jobs ccu went in another direction and from an ordinary worker three years of vocational school and a street cigarette smuggler became a director of the citys cemetery about whose high income both official and more often unofficial under the counter there are fantastical stories being told throughout the city leaving nothing to chance ccu managed to secure for himself two diplomas just in case they were needed they may come in handy and it sounds better when introducing oneself even assuming that the abovequoted statements were exaggerated value judgments rather than statements of fact or even that they amounted to journalistic provocation see for example kuliś cited above with further references the applicant ms b and their publication provided absolutely no evidence in the civil proceedings in support of the contention implicit or otherwise that mr a had in fact obtained any financial gain illegally or had somehow secured his two diplomas improperly or unlawfully see paragraphs and above mere speculation or at best conjecture in this regard see paragraph above clearly could not suffice as a proper basis for such serious allegations despite the fact that mr a had indeed been a public figure at the material time and that the article itself concerned generally a topic of some public interest it follows therefore that the two paragraphs in question were intended to belittle mr as person in breach of the relevant journalistic and ethical standards as suggested by the government in their observations and explained by the civil courts in their judgments see paragraphs and above also compare and contrast to for example ziembiński v poland no no and july where the publication in question was deemed satirical and did not involve accusations of criminal wrongdoing by the local government officials concerning the remainder of the impugned article the court has emphasised on many occasions that article of the convention is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such being the demands of that pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society see among other authorities handyside v the united kingdom december series a no and observer and guardian v the united kingdom november series a no indeed the role of the press as a public watchdog allows journalists and publishers to have recourse to a certain degree of exaggeration provocation or even harshness see kuliś cited aboveδ the consequences of the publication of the article in respect of mr a as already noted above the right to protection of reputation is a right which is guaranteed under article of the convention as part of the right to respect for private life see paragraphs and above given the nature of the allegations concerning mr a published in paragraphs and of the impugned article see paragraph above as well as its own conclusions set out in paragraph above the court considers that the consequences of their publication were clearly sufficiently serious so as to attract the protection of article in respect of mr as reputation see paragraph above the domestic civil courts were clearly also of this opinion having ruled that mr a had in fact suffered a breach of his honour as well as his reputation see paragraphs and aboveε the severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant the nature and severity of the sanction imposed is also a matter of particular importance in assessing the proportionality of the interference under article see paragraph above the amount of any compensation awarded must likewise bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the moral injury suffered by the plaintiff in question see tolstoy miloslavsky v the united kingdom july series a no b see also tešić cited above turning to the present case the court considers that the final civil court judgment rendered against the applicant ordering him together with the other two respondents jointly to pay an rsd equivalent of approximately eur for the mental anguish suffered and the costs incurred plus statutory interest can not as such be deemed severe particularly given the number of the respondents in question and the fact that the amounts awarded were never enforced against any of them see paragraphs and above also compare and contrast to tešić cited above and ζ conclusion in the light of the above considerations the court is of the opinion particularly given some of the allegations contained in paragraphs and of the article that a fair balance has been struck between the applicants freedom of expression on the one hand and mr as interest in the protection of his reputation on the other it finds therefore no need to substitute its views in this regard for those of the domestic courts see paragraph above it is further noted that despite the essential role of the press in a democratic society paragraph of article does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage involving matters of serious public concern see for example bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii and monnat v switzerland no echr x the protection afforded by article of the convention to journalists as well as to editors by implication is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism see for example bédat cited above in view of the foregoing there has been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimouslydeclares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rules of court hasan bakırcı jon fridrik kjølbro deputy registrar president in the said title this person was referred to by his full name and surname but in this judgment he shall instead be referred to as mr a except for the subtitle of the published article and the article itself where the journalist used the

11,the first applicant had its registered office in kirov the second applicant was born in and lives in kirov the first applicant was a limited liability company founded by the state property department of the kirov regional government and registered as a legal entity in on an unspecified date the kirov regional legislative assembly and the kirov regional government founded the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper on august it was officially registered as a regional news medium the official address of its editorial board was the same as that of the first applicant according to the applicants the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper was not registered as a legal entity and did not have articles of association the first applicant was the publisher of the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper the applicants were however unable to submit a publishing agreement according to its articles of association as amended on may the first applicants main activity consisted in issuing the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper it also carried out publishing and advertising activities the first applicant was managed by its executive body the editorinchief that position was occupied at the material time by the second applicant who was at the same time the editorinchief of the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper a the article on august the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper published an article under the headline the chief federal inspector has brought the media to its knees but not the businessmen гфи поставил на колени прессу но не коммерсантов the article was written by the second applicant who signed it using his penname semyon volkov the article concerned a joint press conference held by mr p the chief federal inspector for the kirov region and mr k the mayor of kirov the press conference was about the media coverage of the regional project kirov cultural capital of the volga region for the article was critical of the cultural value of the events connected with the project and spoke ironically about mr ps accomplishments in that field mr p was further quoted as saying that the allotted funds were insufficient to finance the work of the projects organising committee and as criticising local businesses for their unwillingness to sponsor the project allegedly because the project had not received the governors explicit endorsement the article then went on as follows curiously enough just before that meeting i had a chance to talk to some businessmen i know they told me that the chief federal inspectors office had literally pestered them with offers for them to become sponsors however they do not respond to such offers not because they fear the governor but because they do not want to give money some say that mr p is too deeply involved in political games of which they want no part others are for some reason concerned that their money might be wasted on the lovers of the collector of funds rather than spent on cultural events b defamation proceedings on august mr p in his official capacity as the chief federal inspector brought an action for defamation against the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper and the author of the article semyon volkov according to his statement of claim the final paragraph of the contested article had asserted that he was in charge of the collection and distribution of funds for the project that he was capable of committing a crime by embezzling the funds entrusted to him and that he had lovers thereby violating moral and ethical norms considering that those statements were untrue and damaging to his honour dignity and professional reputation he sought a retraction and compensation for nonpecuniary damage mr p also enclosed the text of the retraction statement that he wished the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper to publish it contained an apology and an acknowledgement that the last sentence of the paragraph cited above was untrue and damaging to his honour and reputation a promise to discipline the author of the article and an undertaking to respect the domestic law on the media in the future on september mr g deputy editorinchief of the first applicant signed a power of attorney appointing mr k and mr r to act as its counsel in the defamation proceedings on september judge s of the leninskiy district court of kirov decided to sever the claim against the author of the article for adjudication in separate proceedings because the first applicant had refused to disclose his identity the proceedings against the author were stayed proceedings in respect of the first applicant on september the leninskiy district court of kirov sitting in a singlejudge formation comprising judge s held a hearing counsel mr k and mr r asked that the hearing be adjourned because the second applicant the newspapers editorinchief and the only person acquainted with the circumstances relating to the contested publication was on annual leave until october the court refused the request mr k and mr r further submitted that the contested statements did not concern mr p who was not the collector of funds for the cultural project the funds were being collected by the kirov town administration counsel for mr p submitted that the article had been entirely devoted to mr p it stated in particular that he had pestered local businessmen with requests to become sponsors of the cultural project the last sentence of the article which concerned the collector of funds could easily be interpreted as directed at mr p such an interpretation had indeed been made by a number of local newspapers which had also understood the last sentence of the article as referring to mr p on september the leninskiy district court of kirov granted mr ps claim against the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper in full the court found that the final paragraph of the article contained false information about the plaintiff who it had falsely alleged was the collector of funds that might have been wasted on lovers rather than spent on cultural events the court noted that the defendant had not produced any proof of the truthfulness of that information it ordered the editorial board to pay the plaintiff russian roubles rur approximately euros eur in compensation for nonpecuniary damage and rur in court fees it further ordered an immediate publication of the retraction statement as drafted by mr p on september enforcement proceedings were opened on the same day the first applicant applied to the leninskiy district court for a stay in the enforcement proceedings it submitted that the court had ordered the enforcement of the judgment against the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper which had no legal entity status and accordingly could not be a defendant in civil proceedings furthermore the order for immediate enforcement was unlawful and violated the first applicants right to know the reasons for the judgment at that time the full text of the judgment was unavailable and to lodge an appeal against it on september judge s issued two interim decisions by the first decision he refused the first applicants request for a stay of enforcement as unsubstantiated no further reasons were given the second decision rectified an error in the operative part of the judgment it held that the defendants name was the limited liability company the editorial board of the vesti newspaper rather than the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper on september the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper published the retraction statement as drafted by mr p and endorsed in the judgment of september on september the first applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment of september submitting that the article had not named the collector of funds for the project or suggested that it was mr p who had collected the funds nor had it stated that mr p had lovers or that he had embezzled any funds entrusted to him it was clear from the text that the contested sentence did not concern mr p at all the first applicant further complained about the district courts unreasoned refusal to adjourn the hearing until the second applicant had returned from leave the second applicant was the only person who knew the identity of the author of the article and who was able to give an informed response to the statement of claim the second applicant lodged a statement in support of the appeal he disclosed that he was the author of the article and stated that the judgment of september had been poorly reasoned although mr p had failed to prove that the contested sentence concerned him personally the district court had accepted his claim without analysing whether the impugned statements were indeed directed at him proceedings in respect of the second applicant on an unspecified date the proceedings against the author of the article were resumed and the second applicant was summoned to appear before the leninskiy district court as the defendant in mr ps defamation case instituted on august his case was heard by a bench composed of the presiding judge s and two lay assessors the second applicant lodged an objection against judge s on the ground that he had already expressed his position in the judgment against the editorial board lay assessors examined and rejected the objection finding that the second applicants fears as to mr ss impartiality were not justified at the hearing on october the second applicant was represented by mr r as counsel the second applicant and his counsel both argued that the last sentence of the article did not concern mr p it concerned the collector of funds who had not been identified in the article the fact that other newspapers had interpreted the last sentence as directed at mr p was irrelevant because the second applicant could not be held responsible for the actions of other people they further submitted that the second applicant had simply repeated the reservations expressed by businessmen with regard to the distribution of the funds collected for the project counsel for mr p repeated the arguments he had advanced at the hearing of september in particular the reasons why mr p believed that the contested statements were directed at him he submitted in particular that the title and the structure of the article showed that it was entirely about mr p and that other people had understood the last sentence of the article as concerning mr p and this had been proved by articles in other newspapers on october the leninskiy district court issued a judgment against the second applicant the court found that the article read as a whole gave the impression that the contested statements concerned mr p the same interpretation had been arrived at by other newspapers which had been unanimous in considering that the last sentence had been about mr p the contested statements which accused mr p of spending public funds on lovers were damaging to his honour dignity and professional reputation the second applicant had failed to prove the truthfulness of his statements about mr p the second applicant was ordered to pay rur approximately euros in compensation for nonpecuniary damage and rur in court fees the second applicant appealed he repeated the arguments advanced in his statement in support of the first applicants appeal he further argued that the outcome of his case had been predetermined by the judgment against the editorial board judge s who had examined the case against the editorial board was bound to have had a preconceived opinion on his case appeal proceedings in respect of the applicants on october the kirov regional court adjourned the examination of the appeals it established that the interim decision of september rectifying an error in the judgment of september had been issued in the absence of the interested parties moreover the parties had not received a copy of that decision and had thereby been deprived of an opportunity to appeal until that omission had been remedied the appeal against the judgment of september could not be examined nor could the appeal against the judgment of october because both cases were based on the same claim the determination of one of them would prejudge the outcome of the other on that ground the kirov regional court decided that the two cases should be joined and all appeals should be examined simultaneously on november the first applicant lodged an appeal against the interim decision of september it argued that that decision was unlawful for the following reasons the rectification had been made by the district court of its own motion the decision had been taken in the absence of the parties and in substance the decision was the disguised substitution of a defendant rather than a correction of a clerical error or an obvious mistake the first applicant submitted that the limited liability company the editorial board of the vesti newspaper and the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper were two distinct entities the first was registered as a legal entity while the second was operating without state registration the fact that the district court had issued a judgment against the wrong entity demonstrated that the adjudication of the case had been superficial and the essential aspects of the case had not been examined properly on november the leninskiy district court by a new interim decision confirmed its earlier decision of september on the rectification of the error regarding the defendants name the first applicant lodged an appeal repeating the arguments advanced in the appeal statement of november on december the kirov regional court examined all the appeals both applicants were represented at the hearing by mr r the kirov regional court quashed the interim decision of september on the ground that it had been issued in the absence of the parties but upheld the interim decision of november which in its view was lawful thus it found that counsel who had taken part in the hearing of september had represented the interests of the first applicant the limited liability company the editorial board of the vesti newspaper it was clear that the judgment of september defined the rights of and imposed obligations on the first applicant because no other organisation had been involved in the proceedings the amendment of the defendants name had therefore been no more than a rectification of a clerical error not related to the merits of the case and having no effect on the substance of the judgment the regional court further upheld the judgments of september and october in substance in particular it found that the district court had addressed the applicants arguments relating to the existence of an objective link between the contested statements and the plaintiff it had analysed the tile structure and contents of the impugned article and had correctly found that its last sentence concerned mr p moreover it had taken into account that mr p was not the only one to have understood that the sentence had been directed at him other newspapers had also drawn the same conclusion the district court had therefore correctly required the defendants to prove the truthfulness of their allegations which they had failed to do both applicants had been represented at hearings by counsel and their procedural rights had therefore been respected finally the regional court held that the severance of the claim against the second applicant from the proceedings had not involved a substantially incorrect determination of the dispute the regional court found however that the district court had incorrectly required the first applicant to publish the retraction statement drafted by the plaintiff the requirement for an apology a promise to discipline the author and an undertaking to respect domestic law contained in the retraction statement had no basis in domestic law the order for immediate enforcement had also been unlawful the court ordered that the first applicant publish an amended retraction statement it also reduced the award payable by the first applicant to rur approximately euros on january the first applicant published the amended retraction statement on august the first applicant was declared insolvent and dissolved ii relevant domestic lawa civil actions for defamation article of the civil code provides that an individual may apply to a court with a request for the retraction of statements svedeniya that are damaging to his or her honour dignity or professional reputation if the person who disseminated such statements does not prove their truthfulness the aggrieved person may also claim compensation for losses and nonpecuniary damage sustained as a result of the dissemination of such statements ruling no of the plenary supreme court of the russian federation adopted on august as amended on april and in force at the material time provided that in order to be considered damaging statements had to be untrue and contain allegations of a breach of laws or moral principles for example the commission of a dishonest act or improper behaviour in the workplace or in everyday life dissemination of statements was understood as the publication of statements or their broadcasting paragraph the burden of proof was on the defendant to show that the disseminated statements were true and accurate paragraph on february the plenary supreme court of the russian federation adopted ruling no requiring courts hearing defamation claims to distinguish between statements of facts which could be checked for veracity and evaluative judgments opinions and convictions which were not actionable under article of the civil code because they were expressions of a defendants subjective opinion and views and therefore could not be checked for veracity paragraph furthermore it prohibited the courts from ordering defendants to make an apology to a plaintiff because that form of redress had no basis under russian law including article of the civil code paragraph b defendants in an action for defamation the mass media act

of its date the parties could appeal against the rectification order article the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicants complained of a violation of their right to freedom of expression as provided in article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the applicants submitted that there had been an unlawful interference with their freedom of expression in particular they submitted that the order to publish a retraction statement containing an apology and the order for immediate enforcement had had no basis in domestic law although the appeal court had acknowledged that those orders had been unlawful it had not remedied the violation on the contrary the appeal court had aggravated the situation by requiring the first applicant to publish a second retraction statement thus the first applicant had been punished twice the applicants also argued that the first applicant the publisher of the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper could not be cited as a defendant under domestic law an action for defamation had to be brought against the editorial board because the editorial board of the newspaper did not have legal entity status the action had to be brought against its founders the government of the kirov region and the legislative assembly of the kirov region who should have been cited as the defendants see the supreme courts ruling of august cited in paragraph above therefore there had been no legal basis for bringing an action for defamation against the publisher the applicants further argued that the interference had been disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued the article had denounced the administrative pressure placed on businessmen with the aim of compelling them to sponsor government projects it had also voiced the apprehensions of those businessmen that the funds thus collected might be misappropriated it had therefore raised questions of public concern moreover the author had simply shared with his readers the opinions held by others without stating that those opinions were true or valid accordingly the interference with the applicants freedom of expression had not corresponded to a pressing social need the government submitted firstly that the interference with the applicants freedom of expression had been lawful the first applicant had been cited as a defendant in the defamation proceedings in accordance with domestic law as to the allegedly unlawful order to publish a retraction statement containing an apology the government submitted that that order had later been quashed on appeal the government conceded that the contested article had raised questions of public concern and that the limits of acceptable criticism in respect of mr p a civil servant were wider than in the case of a private individual they submitted however that the article had not been limited to criticism of mr ps actions in an official capacity it had also encroached on the private sphere claiming that mr p had lovers the government disputed the applicants arguments that there had been no objective link between those statements and mr p the contested article had been entirely devoted to the activities of the chief federal inspector mr p taking into account the articles title structure and contents there could be no doubt that the statements concerning the collector of funds had been directed at mr p those statements had been intended as statements of fact and the applicants had failed to prove their truthfulness given that the statements published by the applicants were damaging to mr ps honour and reputation the interference with their freedom of expression had been justified the court notes that it is common ground between the parties that the judgments adopted by the domestic courts in the defamation proceedings constituted an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression guaranteed by article it is not contested that the interference pursued a legitimate aim that of protecting the reputation or rights of others within the meaning of article the dispute in the case relates to whether the interference was prescribed by law and whether it was necessary in a democratic society the court notes that article of the civil code provides a legal basis for civil liability for defamation the applicants however argued in accordance with the ruling by the plenary supreme court see paragraph above that an action for defamation had to be brought against the editorial board and that there was therefore no legal basis for holding the first applicant the publisher of the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper liable the court observes that the applicants assertion that the first applicant and the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper were separate entities is not supported by any evidence the applicants were unable to submit any document showing that the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper existed as a distinct though unregistered legal entity the court notes that under domestic law an editorial board must have articles of association even if it has not been registered as a legal entity see paragraph above however the applicants did not submit a copy of the editorial boards articles of association although they were requested to do so by the court nor did they produce a copy of the compulsory publishing agreement between the editorial board or the editorinchief and the publisher see paragraph above further it is clear from the first applicants articles of association that its activities consisted in issuing as well as publishing the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper see paragraph above given that domestic law provides that the issuing of the news medium is the main function of an editorial board see paragraph above the court can not but conclude that the first applicant was acting both as the newspapers editorial board and its publisher this conclusion finds further confirmation in the fact that the newspapers editorial board was registered at the first applicants official address and that the second applicant occupied the positions of both editorinchief of the first applicant and editorinchief of the newspaper finally the court finds it significant that the applicants never claimed in the domestic proceedings that there was no legal basis for the first applicants liability on the ground that it was the publisher rather than the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper in view of the above the court concludes that the first applicant combined the functions of editorial board and publisher of the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper and could be therefore held liable for defamation under domestic law further as regards the applicants argument that the order to publish a retraction statement containing an apology and the order for immediate enforcement had no basis in domestic law the court notes that it has previously found that before the ruling of the plenary supreme court see paragraph above russian courts could reasonably interpret article of the civil code as providing for an apology as part of the redress for defamation see kazakov v russia no and december thus in the circumstances of the present case the court is ready to accept that the interpretation of the relevant legislation by the russian courts was not such as to render the impugned interference unlawful in convention terms in any event the order to publish a retraction statement containing an apology and the order for immediate enforcement were quashed on appeal see paragraph above the irregularity alleged was thereby expressly acknowledged and adequately redressed in view of the above the court finds that the interference with the applicants freedom of expression was prescribed by law it remains to be determined whether it was necessary in a democratic society the test of necessity in a democratic society requires the court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a pressing social need whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient in assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation this margin of appreciation is not however unlimited but goes hand in hand with a european supervision by the court whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article the courts task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities but rather to review under article in the light of the case as a whole the decisions they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation in so doing the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see among many others grinberg v russia no july stoll v switzerland gc no echr v krasulya v russia no february mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no july and most recently animal defenders international v the united kingdom gc no april in the present case the second applicant expressed his views by having them published in a newspaper edited by the first applicant they were found civilly liable for that publication therefore the impugned interference must be seen in the context of the essential role of the press in ensuring the proper functioning of a democratic society see lingens v austria july series a no and sürek v turkey no gc no echr iv it is also significant that the plaintiff mr p the chief federal inspector of the kirov region was a civil servant although it can not be said that civil servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent politicians do civil servants acting in an official capacity are like politicians subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals see thoma v luxembourg no echr iii further the allegations of misappropriation of public funds were obviously a matter of great public concern and therefore came within the scope of a public debate on a matter of general importance the court reiterates that there is little scope under article of the convention for restrictions on political speech or debates on questions of public interest see feldek v slovakia no echr viii and sürek cited above that being said the court reiterates that article of the convention protects journalists right to divulge information on issues of general interest provided that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the ethics of journalism under the terms of paragraph of article of the convention freedom of expression carries with it duties and responsibilities which also apply to the media even with respect to matters of serious public concern moreover these duties and responsibilities are liable to assume significance when there is a question of attacking the reputation of a named individual and infringing the rights of others thus special grounds are required before the media can be dispensed from their ordinary obligation to verify factual statements that are defamatory of private individuals whether such grounds exist depends in particular on the nature and degree of the defamation in question and the extent to which the media can reasonably regard their sources as reliable with respect to the allegations see lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc nos and echr and pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi the court observes that the applicants were found civilly liable for disseminating a statement which they had been unable to prove to the effect that the collector of funds for a regional cultural project might misappropriate the collected funds and spend them on his lovers the main dispute between the parties related to whether the contested statement concerned the plaintiff the court has repeatedly stated that for an interference with the right to freedom of expression to be proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation of others the existence of an objective link between the impugned statement and the person suing for defamation is a requisite element mere personal conjecture or a subjective perception of a statement as defamatory does not suffice to establish that the person was directly affected by it there must be something in the circumstances of a particular case to make the ordinary reader feel that the statement reflected directly on the individual claimant or that he was targeted by the criticism see filatenko v russia no december and dyuldin and kislov v russia no july the court notes that the question whether there was an objective link between the impugned statement and the plaintiff mr p was extensively debated in the domestic proceedings after hearing the parties analysing the title structure and contents of the impugned article and studying how it was understood by other newspapers the courts found that the statement was directed at mr p see paragraphs and above the court does not see any reason to depart from that finding it is true that the collector of funds was not mentioned by name and that mr p did not officially perform that function as the funds were formally collected by the local administration however when read in context in particular in conjunction with the articles title and such statements as the chief federal inspectors office literally pestered them with offers to become sponsors the contested statement might convey to an ordinary reader the impression that it was the chief federal inspector mr p who was the collector of funds referred to in the contested statement indeed that was the interpretation made by a number of the local newspapers which also understood that the contested statement was directed at mr p the court therefore accepts the finding of the domestic courts that the applicant had disseminated a statement that the plaintiff mr p might spend public funds on his lovers the court considers it regrettable that the domestic courts did not express any opinion as to whether the above statement constituted a factual allegation or a value judgment before holding the applicants liable for their failure to prove its veracity the court finds it difficult to determine whether that statement was a statement of fact or a value judgment the use of the modal verb might suggests that it was a supposition rather than a statement of fact indeed from a grammatical point of view modality deals with uncertainties and attitudes rather than certainties and facts however it is not necessary to determine this issue because under the courts caselaw even a value judgment must be based on sufficient facts in order to constitute a fair comment under article see jerusalem v austria no echr ii the court notes that the applicants never endeavoured to establish a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis for their allegation that mr p had lovers and might spend public funds on them although the second applicant claimed that he had obtained that information from some unnamed businessmen he knew see paragraph above he never attempted to verify the rumours the court reiterates in this connection that even public figures may legitimately expect to be protected against the propagation of unfounded rumours relating to their private life see standard verlags gmb h v austria no no june given that the applicants were unable to adduce sufficient evidence in support of their allegations the court considers that they disseminated unverified information about mr ps alleged involvement in extramarital affairs and a gratuitous accusation of misappropriation of public funds the court sees no reason to disagree with the domestic courts assessment that the contested statement was of such a nature and gravity as to be capable of causing considerable harm to the reputation of mr p it therefore finds the statements about mr ps private life and his alleged mismanagement of public funds frivolous and unfounded the applicants must be therefore taken to have gone beyond the limits of responsible journalism set out in paragraph above finally in assessing the proportionality of an interference the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are also factors to be taken into account see skałka v poland no may in this connection the court notes that the amount of damages the applicants were ordered to pay to the plaintiff does not appear excessive in the light of these considerations it can not be said that the decisions of the domestic courts overstepped the margin of appreciation afforded to them thus the court accepts that the interference complained of was not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and can therefore be considered necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention accordingly there has been no violation of article of the convention ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicants complained under article of the convention that the courts that examined the defamation claim against them had been biased and that the principles of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms had been breached the relevant parts of article read as follows in the determination of his civil rights and obligations everyone is entitled to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal a impartiality of the courts the applicants submitted that judge s the only professional judge in the formation examining the claims against the second applicant had been biased firstly he had adjudicated the claims against the first applicant and had already stated his position on the merits of the case in the applicants opinion in order to maintain the appearance that his position was consistent judge s had to arrive at the same conclusions in respect of the claims against the second applicant secondly by resuming of his own motion the case against the second applicant judge s had acted in the interests of the plaintiff thereby demonstrating his prejudice against the applicants the government argued that the claims against the author had been correctly and lawfully severed from the claims against the editorial board the editorial board had refused to reveal the identity of the author of the impugned article and the courts had had no other choice but to sever the claims after the name of the author had been revealed and the proceedings against him had resumed there had been no procedural obstacles to prevent judge s who had adjudicated the claims against the editorial board from examining the claims against the author under domestic law there were no grounds for objecting to judge s the court reiterates that impartiality normally denotes the absence of prejudice or bias and its existence or otherwise can be tested in various ways the court has thus distinguished between a subjective approach that is endeavouring to ascertain the personal conviction or interest of a given judge in a particular case and an objective approach that is determining whether he or she offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect see among many other authorities gautrin and others v france may reports of judgments and decisions iii and kyprianou v cyprus gc no echr xiii as to the subjective test the personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary see padovani v italy february series a no b in the instant case the judges subjective impartiality was not disputed by the parties as to the objective test when applied to a single judge or a body sitting as a bench it means determining whether quite apart from the personal conduct of the judge or of any of the members of the judicial bench there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to the judges or the benchs impartiality in this regard even appearances may be of some importance what is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public it follows that when it is being decided whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or judicial bench lacks impartiality the standpoint of those claiming that the judge or the bench is not impartial is important but not decisive what is decisive is whether the fear can be held to be objectively justified see gautrin and others and kyprianou both cited above and respectively in the present case the fears of bias stemmed principally from the fact that judge s one of the three judges on the bench examining the claims against the second applicant had already stated his position that the contested statements were defamatory in the case against the first applicant the court accepts that that situation could raise doubts about the impartiality of judge s in the applicants mind it has thus to decide whether those doubts were objectively justified the court has found in a number of cases that the involvement of the same judge in two sets of the proceedings concerning the same events may under certain circumstances cast doubts on that judges impartiality see for example ferrantelli and santangelo v italy august reports iii and rojas morales v italy no november where a violation of article was found because a judge sitting in a criminal case had earlier tried a coaccused and by contrast schwarzenberger v germany no et seq august martelli v italy dec no april and poppe v the netherlands no et seq march where no violation of article was found in similar circumstances see also fatullayev v azerbaijan no april where the same judge examined questions of both civil liability and criminal liability arising from the same facts at the same time the court reiterates that the mere fact that the same judge adjudicated two sets of proceedings arising out of the same events is not in itself sufficient to undermine that judges impartiality and that the answer to the question whether an applicants fears are objectively justified depends on the circumstances and the special features of each particular case see schwarzenberger cited above poppe cited above see also delage and magistrello v france dec no january lindon otchakovsky laurens and july cited above and cañas gómez v spain dec no september all concerning involvement of the same judge in two civil cases arising out of the same events turning to the circumstances of the present case the court notes that the plaintiff mr p submitted claims simultaneously against the editorial board of the newspaper and the author of the contested article whose identity was unknown the case was attributed to judge s given that the first applicant the editorial board of the newspaper refused to disclose the identity of the author judge s severed the claims against the author for adjudication in separate proceedings and stayed those proceedings after the pronouncement by judge s on september of the judgment against the first applicant and while the appeal against that judgment was pending the second applicant disclosed that he was the author of the article immediately after that judge s resumed the proceedings against the author on october judge s presiding over a bench of two lay assessors issued the judgment against the second applicant the two sets of proceedings were then joined and examined simultaneously by the appeal court in order to determine whether the involvement of judge s in the proceedings against the second applicant after he had participated in the proceedings against the first applicant casts objectively justified doubts on his impartiality the court must take into account the following circumstances the nature and extent of judge ss functions during both sets of proceedings whether the text of the judgment against the first applicant contained any statements concerning the second applicant and created the impression that judge s considered the second applicant liable for defamation and whether in the course of the proceedings against the second applicant judge s gave fresh consideration to the case taking into account the new evidence submitted by the second applicant see ferrantelli and santangelo cited above rojas morales cited above delage and magistrello cited above schwarzenberger cited above and martelli cited above lindon otchakovsky laurens and july cited above poppe cited above and and cañas gómez cited above the court notes that in the judgment of september judge s found on the basis of the evidence available to him at that time that the first applicant was liable for defamation because it had failed to prove the truthfulness of the allegations published by it he did not make any findings as to the liability of the author of the article nor did he use any expressions which might create the impression that he had formed any opinion as to the liability of the author see paragraph above further the court observes that when examining the claims against the second applicant judge s was in no way bound by his first decision which was not yet final indeed the judgment of october against the second applicant did not contain any references to the judgment of september judge s gave fresh consideration to the entire case in adversarial proceedings with the benefit of the more comprehensive information obtainable from the second applicant the author of the contested article the second applicant was free to advance new legal arguments or submit evidence showing that the impugned statement authored by him had had a sufficient factual basis or was otherwise justified as can be seen from the text of the judgment of october the judge took such new arguments and evidence into account when deciding whether the second applicant was liable for defamation see paragraph above in view of the above the court does not see any reason to suspect that judge s a professional judge who possessed the necessary experience and training to allow him to judge a particular dispute fairly on the basis of its own circumstances see mutatis mutandis craxi v italy no no december was prejudiced against the second applicant because of his previous involvement in the proceedings against the first applicant as judge s never made any statements implying that he had formed an unfavourable opinion of the second applicants case before presiding over the court that had to decide it the presumption of impartiality can not be said to have been rebutted finally it is relevant that when examining the claims against the second applicant judge s was not sitting in a singlejudge formation but was assisted by two lay assessors whose impartiality the applicants did not question see mutadis mutandis diennet v france september series a no a consequently any doubts the applicants may have had as regards the impartiality of judge s can not be held to be objectively justified there has therefore been no violation of article of the convention as regards the impartiality of the courts b equality of arms the applicants further submitted that the judgment of september had been given against the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper however on september six days after the pronouncement of the judgment the first applicant had been made a defendant by an interim decision issued in its absence the substitution of a defendant disguised as the rectification of a clerical error had resulted in a violation of the applicants procedural rights the applicants had been absent from the hearing of september and had been given no opportunity to present their case or submit evidence to the district court counsel who had attended the hearing of september had represented the interests of the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper that the first applicant had subsequently retained the same counsel to represent it before the appeal court could not remedy the disadvantage created on september the fact remained that at the crucial firstinstance hearing the applicants had been absent and unrepresented and had been deprived of an opportunity to defend their position and comment on the plaintiffs claims the government submitted that the first applicants representatives had participated in the defamation proceedings from the beginning and had been present at the hearing of september in support of their submissions they produced a power of attorney signed by a deputy editorinchief of the first applicant on september appointing mr k and mr r to act as the first applicants counsel in the defamation proceedings see paragraph above they also produced materials from the case file showing that all written pleadings had been submitted on behalf of the first applicant rather than on behalf of the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper they also referred to the decision of december by the regional court which found that the judgment of september had defined the rights of and imposed obligations on the first applicant because no other organisation had been involved in the proceedings the naming of the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper as the defendant had been no more than a clerical mistake the court reiterates that it is central to the concept of a fair trial in civil as in criminal proceedings that a litigant is not denied the opportunity to present his or her case effectively before the court and that he or she is able to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side see steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii the principle of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms requires that each party be given a reasonable opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations made or evidence adduced by the other party and to present its case under conditions that do not place it at a substantial disadvantage visàvis its opponent see krčmář and others v the czech republic no march and dombo beheer bv v the netherlands october series a no article leaves to the state a free choice of the means to be used in guaranteeing litigants these rights see steel and morris cited above thus given that article of the convention does not guarantee a right to personal presence before a civil court representation may be an appropriate solution in cases where a party can not appear in person see gryaznov v russia no june turning to the citcumstances of the present case the court notes that the applicants assertion that the first applicant was neither present nor represented at the hearing of september is refuted by the documents in the case file it is clear from the materials in the courts possession that from september that is from the very beginning of the defamation proceedings the first applicant was represented by counsel mr k and mr r see paragraph above they submitted written pleadings on the first applicants behalf and participated in all hearings including the hearing of september and the appeal hearings where they made submissions on behalf of the first applicant the applicants allegation that mr k and mr r acted on behalf of the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper does not therefore find confirmation in the case file moreover the court has already found that the first applicant and the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper were one and the same entity see paragraphs to above it is therefore not persuaded by the applicants argument that the interim decision of september was the substitution of a defendant in disguise it is convinced by the domestic courts finding that the judgment of september defined the rights of and imposed obligations on the first applicant because no other organisation had been involved in the proceedings see paragraph above the amendment of the defendants name was therefore no more than a rectification of a clerical error correcting a misspelling of the name of the first applicant which acted as the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper and which had effectively participated as a defendant in the defamation proceedings from their beginning the court concludes that the first applicants representatives participated throughout the defamation proceedings and the first applicant was therefore given an effective opportunity to present its case by commenting on the plaintiffs claims making submissions and adducing evidence as regards the second applicants absence from the hearing of september it is significant that he was informed in advance about that hearing he was therefore given a reasonable opportunity to arrange either for his personal presence or for representation by counsel however he failed to act with reasonable diligence and take the necessary steps to ensure that his case was effectively presented before the court see for similar reasoning milovanova v ukrain dec no october and belan v russia dec no september it is also relevant that the second applicant was personally present and represented by counsel at the hearing of october and at all appeal hearings in view of the above the court finds that the applicants were given a reasonable opportunity to present their case effectively before the courts and were able to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side there has been therefore no violation of article of the convention as regards the principles of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms for these reasons the court unanimously holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention as regards the alleged partiality of the courts holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention as regards the principles of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms done in english and notified in writing on may pursuant to rule and of the rules of court andré wampach isabelle berro lefèvre deputy registrar president,,,
12,background to the case the applicant was born in and lives in weinheim he is a campaigner against abortion and operates an antiabortion website on which he campaigns occasionally in a very graphic way against abortion by a decision of march the federal review board for publications harmful to minors bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende schriften included the applicants website wwwbabycaustde the german website on the list of publications considered to be harmful to minors the applicant subsequently redesigned his online presence his new website included a link in bold type to the website wwwbabycaustat the austrian website which was operated by mh since deceased described by the applicant on his current website as a dear friend and fellow campaigner attached to the link to the austrian website was the following comment if you want to know more about the modernday democratic crime of abortion make your enquiries in austria wenn sie mehr über das modern demokratische verbrechen der abtreibung wissen wollen dann fragen sie in österreich nach at the material time the content of the austrian website was essentially consistent with that of the german website prior to the objection from the federal review board in addition the austrian website contained a link to a version of the applicants complete german website as it had originally existed prior to the federal review boards objection only the website credits had been deleted the applicant had provided mh with a cd containing all the data required for the running of the austrian website the version of the german website which could be reached via the link on the austrian website included the following statement equating the babycaust to the holocaust would mean relativising todays abortion murders den babycaust mit dem holocaust gleichzusetzen würde bedeuten die heutigen abtreibungsmorde zu relativieren moreover on the home page of the austrian website the following statement was shown between two photos of babies one of which was obviously covered in blood there is no other word for it abortion is aggravated murder abtreibung ist mord es gibt kein anderes wortthe photo underneath showed a pile of corpses in an unspecified third reich concentration camp the caption below read abortion and euthanasia are crimes that no human law can presume to declare lawful abtreibung und euthanasie sind verbrechen die für rechtmäßig zu erklären sich menschliches gesetz anmaßen kann furthermore under a link abortions on the austrian website a caricaturelike drawing of a wolf as an executioner guillotining embryos was shown the text above this image read abortionists they can kill but woe betide those who remind them of the killing abtreiber töten können sie aber wehe wenn man sie ans töten erinnert underneath the text read fascists anti fascists whether concentrationcamp commanders or murderers of unborn children both are manifestations of criminals these low lifes have the same genetic makeup faschisten antifaschisten kzkommandanten oder mörder von ungeborenen sind zwei erscheinungsformen von kriminellen menschen diese sumpfblüten haben denselben genetischen code accessible via the link not for the fainthearted were images purporting to show aborted foetuses and the words sixty years post auschwitz after termination its off to the incinerator or the rubbish heap jahre nach auschwitz nach der unterbrechung gehts in den verbrennungsofen oder auf den müll following the link germany and a further link on that page to prayer requests reference was made to a decision by the karlsruhe court of appeal judgment of february u prohibiting the applicant from labelling abortions as performed by the doctors named on his website as aggravated murder the reference was glossed with the following statement we have not labelled and do not label abortion doctors as aggravated murderers however we will stand firm in our conviction that the wilful bringingtodeath of an innocent human being is aggravated murder can anyone seriously argue that an innocent unborn human being is not wilfully killed in an abortion abtreibungsärzte sind von uns nicht als mörder bezeichnet worden und werden von uns nicht als mörder bezeichnet aber wir werden zu unserer meinung stehen das vorsätzliche zu tode bringen eines unschuldigen menschen ist mord und wer kann ernstlich behaupten dass bei einer abtreibung kein unschuldiger ungeborener mensch vorsätzlich getötet wird at the very bottom of the same page under the highlighted text german contemporary history in brief a sentence read perverted doctors murdered unborn children at the behest of their mothers pervertierte ärzte ermordeten im auftrag der mütter die ungeborenen kinder from that page the reader was directed to a locationbased alphabetical list mentioning the names and practice addresses of many doctors across germany who performed abortions the list was accompanied by an invitation to pray for these doctors dr f the plaintiff in the main proceedings was mentioned on the list he was of jewish faith and his family had suffered from the atrocities carried out during the national socialist era b domestic proceedings dr f applied to the courts for an injunction against the applicant and mh as well as for damages for the violation of his personality rights he argued that the websites in question had generated a direct association between the named doctors and the third reich equated abortions with the crimes of the third reich and stigmatised him as a murderer on february the karlsruhe regional court ordered the applicant to desist from using andor allowing the use of the term aggravated murder on the german website or the austrian website to describe abortions performed by dr f who was named on those websites it also ordered the applicant as joint and several debtor gesamtschuldner with mh to pay dr f compensation of euros eur a similar order against mh was issued in a separate judgment the karlsruhe regional court gave the following grounds for its decision firstly it established that the statements at issue could be attributed to the applicant the fact that the said content was accessible only via the indirect route of the austrian website operated by mh was irrelevant the applicant had made the content his own by having referred and created a link on the german website expressly to mhs website he had also not disputed during the proceedings that the statements had originated from him moreover throughout the proceedings he had continuously and with conviction described abortion as aggravated murder and considered the comparison of abortions and the holocaust reflected even in the babycaust domain name to be appropriate in a next step the court analysed screenshots of the website which had been submitted by the plaintiff it concluded that the website at issue contained the general statement that abortions as performed by dr f were acts of aggravated murder comparable with the utterly unjustifiable atrocities inflicted on jews in the third reich by mentioning dr fs name and his practice address directly in this context the applicant had reproached the doctor specifically for performing abortions and had created a pillory effect even though the applicant had made his statements in the context of a public debate of fundamental importance and freedom of expression protected polemical and sharp criticism the applicants comments on the german website and the austrian website had not been posted as broad criticism but specifically against the doctors mentioned on those sites the applicant had purposefully undermined the plaintiffs right of personality by labelling abortion as aggravated murder equating it to the crimes of the holocaust and reproaching dr f specifically for his involvement this was also true on the assumption that the statements constituted an expression of opinion and not a factual claim consequently the weighing of all those considerations turned out in favour of dr fs general right of personality which in these circumstances prevailed over the applicants freedom of expression as regards damages the karlsruhe regional court reasoned that the violation of the right of personality and the associated stigmatising effect were particularly serious given that dr f himself was jewish and his family had suffered directly the nazi atrocities in the third reich moreover the court took into account that the applicant had persistently made these or similar statements and had not been dissuaded by orders to desist issued against him such as the decision of the karlsruhe court of appeal of february u to which the website referred see paragraph above or the inclusion of the website on the list of publications harmful to minors by the federal review board by indicative order of september the karlsruhe court of appeal notified the applicant of its intention to dismiss his appeal owing to insufficient prospects of success the court elaborated that the regional courts conclusion that the austrian website had levelled the serious and personal allegation against dr f that he had performed acts of aggravated murder the allegation had further involved comparing abortions to the extermination of jews under nazi rule this had constituted a serious attack on dr fs reputation and personality rights the court of appeal also confirmed that the applicant had to assume responsibility for the content of the austrian website he had given the relevant content from his own website over to mh and had given his consent by means of a link for it to be posted on the austrian website moreover the award of monetary compensation was appropriate in the light of the severity of the interference with the general right of personality the regional court had correctly taken into account to the detriment of the applicant that he had failed to observe the legally binding decision of the karlsruhe court of appeal of february the court further clarified that for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation to be awarded it was irrelevant whether dr f was jewish and that his family had been persecuted under the nazi regime in support of that view the court adjudged that there were no apparent indications that the applicant had had or should have had any such knowledge the applicant was provided with the opportunity to submit his position on the above reasoning which he made use of to no avail on february the karlsruhe court of appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant without an oral hearing it referred to its reasoning in the indicative order of september and emphasised that the awarded damages had been justified irrespective of whether dr f was jewish on april the federal constitutional court refused to admit a complaint by the applicant for adjudication for being inadmissible bv r without providing reasons ii relevant domestic law and practice the relevant domestic law and practice have been set out in the courts judgment in annen no no september the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the civil injunction and the order to pay damages had violated his freedom of expression as provided in article of the convention which reads in so far as relevant as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others a admissibility the court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions the applicant submitted that his statements had contributed to a public debate of great importance and had not been aimed at equating the inhuman killing by nazi doctors to the medical activities performed by dr f however mentioning the holocaust had been aimed at having a warning effect the applicant further argued that dr fs faith had had no bearing on the criticism of his conduct which he had also made in regard to doctors of other faiths moreover the applicant put forward the argument that abortions could be considered aggravated murder as maliciousness was defined as the exploitation of the victims helplessness and lack of suspicion in sum he claimed that there had been no pressing social need for the injunction and the order to pay damages and given his contribution to a public debate dr fs personality rights should not have been considered more important than his freedom of expression the government accepted that the judgments of the domestic courts had constituted an interference with the applicants freedom of expression nonetheless they submitted that this interference had been based on articles of the civil code pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and reputation of dr f and had been ultimately justified the courts had assessed the content of the websites with the help of screenshots in detail and had considered possible interpretations however they had come to the conclusion that based on a realistic interpretation the website had contained the general statement that the abortions performed by dr f had constituted acts of aggravated murder comparable with the mass murder of jews under the nazi regime as dr f had been listed by name and address on the website he had been indirectly labelled a perverted doctor and murderer of unborn children with a character comparable to a concentration camp commander having regard to these serious allegations the balancing exercise between the applicants freedom of expression and dr fs personality right had had to fall in favour of dr fs rights moreover the accusations had been of such a serious nature that they not only justified a civil injunction but had also an order to pay damages the government also argued that the present case differed strongly from the case of annen v germany no november on a factual level in the present case the applicant had made no reference to the actual legal situation regarding the criminal liability of abortions or to the fact that law and morals could differ from each other moreover the statements comparing abortions to the holocaust were not limited to the domain name babycaust of the website but inter alia to explicitly equating doctors performing abortions to concentration camp commanders the thirdparties submissions the thirdparty intervener adf international submitted that according to the courts caselaw freedom of expression played an essential role in a democratic society and that even ideas that offend shock or disturb were protected under article particular protection was granted to expressions of opinions which were made in the course of a debate on matters of public interest and the court itself had recognised that the question of abortions raised moral and ethical issues of public interest furthermore the court had also recognised the special importance of advocacy groups in democratic societies and for public discussion in sum adf international argued that restrictions on speech in this area could only be justified in the most extraordinary circumstances the thirdparty intervener ordo iuris institute referred to the courts wellestablished caselaw according to which even ideas that offend shock or disturb were protected by freedom of expression it further argued that this caselaw had been followed by polish courts which had accepted comparisons between abortion and genocide in the context of antiabortion campaigns dr f submitted that the right to freedom of expression was subject to the limitations outlined in of article of the convention therefore freedom of expression could be restricted if it was necessary for the protection of the right of others in particular when statements went beyond being polemical or exaggerated critique and solely pilloried someone these statements no longer served a debate of public interest but constituted vilification this held particularly true when doctors were accused of aggravated murder and their medical activities were compared with the unjustifiable annihilation of jews in the third reich the third party intervener further argued that the present case had to be clearly distinguished from annen v germany no november since the statements currently at issue clearly compared abortion with the holocaust and it was not possible to understand them as merely generating awareness that law and morals could differ from each other the courts assessment at the outset the court considers and this is not in dispute between the parties that the injunction and the order to pay damages interfered with the applicants right to freedom of expression that the interferences were prescribed by law namely articles and of the civil code and that they pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of others it therefore remains to be determined whether the interferences were necessary in a democratic society the fundamental principles concerning the question of whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the courts caselaw and have recently been summarised as follows see delfi as v estonia gc no june with further referencesi freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society as set forth in article this freedom is subject to exceptions which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article iii the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts the court further reiterates that the right to protection of reputation is protected by article of the convention as part of the right to respect for private life see chauvy and others v france no echr vi pfeifer v austria no november and polanco torres and movilla polanco v spain no september in order for article to come into play however an attack on a persons reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be made in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see a v norway no april axel springer ag v germany gc no february and delfi as cited above in cases that concerned allegations of criminal conduct the court also took into account that under article of the convention individuals have a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty see among other authorities worm v austria august reports of judgments and decisions v and du roy and malaurie v france no echr x when examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interests of the protection of the reputation or rights of others the court may be required to ascertain whether the domestic authorities have struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see hachette filipacchi associés v france no june mgn limited v the united kingdom no january axel springer ag cited above and delfi as cited above turning to the circumstances of the present case the court observes that the regional court classified the statements not as statements of fact but as expressions of opinion the court will therefore proceed on the assumption that the statements are to be considered value judgments and would reiterate in that regard that while the existence of facts can be demonstrated the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof however even where a statement amounts to a value judgment there must be a sufficient factual basis to support it failing which it will be excessive see jerusalem v austria no echr ii the court notes that the domestic courts concluded that the website contained the general statement that abortions as performed by dr f were acts of aggravated murder given the applicants statements such as there is no other word for it abortion is aggravated murder and we will stand firm in our conviction that the wilful bringingtodeath of an innocent human being is aggravated murder the court agrees with that conclusion the court also takes note of the fact that the applicant argued before the court that abortions could be considered aggravated murder within the meaning of article of the criminal code however it also observes that article of the criminal code clearly outlines the criminal liability of abortions that are not exempted from criminal liability under article a of the criminal code and that there is no domestic caselaw or other evidence in domestic law supporting the applicants claim in sum the court finds that there was not a sufficient factual basis for calling abortions as performed by dr f aggravated murder in that regard the court also notes that these accusations were not only very serious something reflected in the fact that a conviction for aggravated murder would carry a life sentence but might also incite to hatred and aggression the court further observes that the domestic courts additionally justified the injunction and the order to pay damages by the applicants comparison of abortion with the holocaust and the atrocities under the nazi regime the court would reiterate that the impact an expression of opinion has on another persons personality rights can not be detached from the historical and social context in which the statement was made and that references to the holocaust must be seen in the specific context of german history see annen cited above hoffer and annen v germany dec nos january in the annen case the court concluded that the holocaust reference in the leaflet at issue alone could not justify a civil injunction since the applicant had not explicitly equated abortion with the holocaust and his reference to the killing of human beings in auschwitz could be understood as a way of creating awareness of the general fact that law may diverge from morality however the court notes that the applicants statements in the present case exceeded the ones examined in the context of the case of annen and that the applicant equated doctors who performed abortions with concentration camp commanders and even stated that equating the babycaust with the holocaust would mean relativising todays abortion murders in view of these statements the court agrees with the findings of the domestic courts that the applicant had equated the medical activities of dr f to the utterly unjustifiable atrocities inflicted on jews under the nazi regime in sum the court considers that the applicants statement had no sufficient factual foundation and severely violated dr fs reputation consequently the reasons adduced by the domestic courts were not only relevant but also sufficient to justify the interferences with the applicants freedom of expression lastly the court observes that the applicant was not criminally convicted for slander as regards the civil injunction the court takes note of the fact that the applicant was not prevented from campaigning against abortions in general but only prohibited from describing abortions as performed by dr f as aggravated murder in so far as damages are concerned the court observed that the domestic courts elaborated in detail why the violations of dr fs personality rights had been particularly serious and why they considered damages appropriate in the present case while the court accepts that this interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression was more intense than in cases where he was only ordered to desist from making a specific statement it considers that based on the national courts reasoning the amount awarded to dr f did not fall outside their margin of appreciation in these circumstances the court concludes that the injunction and the order to pay damages were not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and that the reasons given by the domestic courts were relevant and sufficient the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression could therefore reasonably be regarded by the domestic courts as necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation and rights of dr f there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the complaints concerning article of the convention admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rules of court claudia westerdiek yonko grozev registrar president,,,
13,in and lives in genappe he was represented by mr a berenboom lawyer the belgian government the government were represented by their agent ms i niedlispacher of the federal justice department background to the case the applicant is the publisher of the newspaper le soir one of belgiums leading frenchlanguage newspapers in a print edition of the newspaper an article reported among other items on a car accident caused by g that had led to the death of two people and injured three others the article mentioned gs full name g was convicted in connection with the incident in he served his sentence and was formally rehabilitated in since june the newspapers website has provided an electronic version of its archives dating back to including the abovementioned article when the archives were published online and throughout the proceedings before the domestic courts the articles were freely accessible on the website on june july and august g wrote to the legal department of the public limited company rossel et compagnie which owned le soir requesting that the article be removed from the newspapers electronic archives or at least rendered anonymous in support of his request g referred to the fact that he was a doctor and that the article appeared on the list of search results when his name was typed into several search engines on january the legal department of rossel et compagnie refused to remove the impugned article from the archives but stated that it had given notice to the administrator of the search engine google to delist the article a reminder was sent to the administrator of google on february before the domestic courts the applicant stated that these steps had produced no response the court has not been informed of any subsequent followup action on march g brought the case before the council for journalistic ethics conseil de déontologie journalistique the cdj the selfregulatory body of the french and germanspeaking media in belgium on april the cdj declared the request inadmissible on the grounds that the dispute did not concern a matter of journalistic ethics it pointed to the solutions that had been adopted by belgian newspaper publishers with regard to electronic press archives namely the right to rectification in cases where the information was inaccurate and the right of electronic communication in cases where the information was incomplete domestic court proceedings in a summons served on may g instituted proceedings against the applicant in the neufchâteau court of first instance seeking to have the online press archive in question anonymised on the basis of article of the civil code in the alternative should the applicant actually provide irrefutable technical evidence of the impossibility of making the information anonymous g sought an order requiring him to add a noindex tag to the online version of the article to prevent it from appearing on the list of results when his name was typed into the search engine of the newspapers website in gs view by keeping the article online without anonymising it or adding a noindex tag despite receiving a reasonable and substantiated request to that effect the applicant had committed a fault and had infringed gs right to be forgotten in a judgment of january the court of first instance allowed most of gs claims noting that the applicant had not adduced any evidence of the impossibility of anonymising the article the court ordered him to replace gs first name and surname by the letter x in the digital version of the article featured on the newspapers website and on any other database for which he was responsible the applicant was ordered to pay one euro to g in respect of nonpecuniary damage and to pay gs costs the court rejected the requests for an anonymised version of the judgment to be sent to the parties and to possible third parties and for the judgment to be declared immediately enforceable in a judgment of september the liège court of appeal upheld the lower courts judgment in its entirety the court of appeal began by pointing out that each of the parties had fundamental rights that were not absolute and were of equal ranking as to the criterion of lawfulness required in order to derogate from the principle of freedom of expression the court of appeal noted that the right to be forgotten was considered an integral part of the right to respect for private life as enshrined in article of the convention article of the international covenant on civil and political rights and article of the constitution that was sufficient to satisfy the lawfulness test in order to derogate from the principle of freedom of expression the court dismissed the applicants argument that article of the civil code did not provide a clear and foreseeable legal basis the provision in question constituted the ordinary rules on liability and was applicable to news organisations which could not be unaware that they might be held liable if the exercise of press freedom caused damage resulting from an infringement of the rights of others as the court of first instance had observed articles et seq of the civil code as interpreted by the belgian legal literature and caselaw constituted legislation that was sufficiently accessible clear precise and foreseeable for the purposes of article of the convention the court of appeal added that alongside the traditional aspect of the right to be forgotten linked to the fresh disclosure by the press of a persons previous convictions there existed a second aspect linked to the erasure of the digital data and in particular the data available on the internet the dispute which concerned the digitisation of journalistic archives related to the latter aspect namely the right to be forgotten online what was sought therefore was the removal of information available on the internet this right to be forgotten online had recently been established by the court of justice of the european union the cjeu in its judgment in google spain and google c may see paragraphs below the cjeu had held that the requirement regarding fresh disclosure of the information could be inferred from the effect of the search tool which gave prominence to information that would not otherwise be visible online it was true that the cjeu judgment concerned a dispute between a private individual and the operator of a search engine nevertheless the principles established by that judgment could be transposed to the case at hand in so far as the publisher had also enabled the article in question to be given prominence via the search engine of the newspapers website which was accessible free of charge the effect had also been multiplied significantly by the development of the operating software used by googletype search engines the indexing of the article on search engines was only possible because it was present in the database of le soir in nonanonymised form and without any noindex tag the right to be forgotten online was not unlimited and had to be regulated in so far as it was liable to come into conflict with the freedom of expression of the press in order to assess whether a balance had been struck between the fundamental rights enshrined inter alia in articles and of the convention it was necessary to have regard to the criteria defined in the courts caselaw von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr and the caselaw of the cjeu google spain and google cited above thus in order for a right to be forgotten to be recognised the facts had to have been disclosed lawfully in the first place and had to be of a judicial nature there could be no current interest in their disclosure the facts could not be of historical interest a certain time had to have elapsed between the two disclosures and the person concerned could not be a public figure had to have an interest in being reintegrated into society and had to have discharged his or her debt the court of appeals task in the case before it was to ascertain whether in the light of these criteria the restriction on press freedom stemming from gs request pursued a legitimate aim and satisfied the proportionality test in conformity with article of the convention in the instant case the court of appeal found that it was not disputed that the original disclosure of the information in question had been lawful and that the facts reported on had been of a judicial nature the fresh disclosure of the facts had no value in terms of newsworthiness g did not hold any public office the mere fact that he was a doctor in no way justified his continued identification in the online article some twenty years after the events the court considered this to be illegitimate and disproportionate since it did not add anything to the value of the article and was liable to cause indefinite and serious harm to gs reputation by giving him a virtual criminal record despite the fact that he had not only served his sentence after a final conviction for the offence but had also been rehabilitated twenty years after the events the identity of a person who was not a public figure did not enhance the public interest of the article which merely contributed at a statistical level to a public debate on road safety in the court of appeals view removing gs first name and surname did not render the information devoid of interest since it would have no impact on the actual substance of the information conveyed which concerned a tragic road traffic accident caused in particular by the harmful effects of alcohol the applicants arguments concerning the duty of remembrance and the need to preserve a full and faithful record in the archives were irrelevant g had not requested that the impugned article be removed from the archives but simply that the electronic version be rendered anonymous the paper archives remained intact and the applicant was still able to ensure the integrity of the original digital version the events reported on in the article were clearly not of historical significance as the article related to a banal albeit tragic news story which was not alleged still less demonstrated to have been a source of particular public concern lastly a significant length of time sixteen years had elapsed between the initial publication of the article and the first request for anonymisation some twenty years had passed by the time of delivery of the judgment it followed from all these considerations that g satisfied the criteria for claiming a right to be forgotten and that keeping the article in question online without rendering it anonymous was liable to cause him disproportionate harm when weighed against the benefits of strict observance of the applicants right to freedom of expression the criteria of lawfulness legitimacy and proportionality arising out of article of the convention were satisfied in the court of appeals view the request for anonymisation had been apt to ensure a proper balance between the interests at stake that balance would not be achieved by the establishment of a right to digital rectification or communication as proposed by the applicant such procedures would not be appropriate as they would allow the stigmatising effect of the serious offences committed by g and of the sentence he had already served to persist indefinitely and would render the rehabilitation order given in his favour meaningless hence the most effective means of protecting gs privacy without interfering to a disproportionate extent with the applicants freedom of expression was to anonymise the article on the website of le soir by replacing gs first name and surname with the letter x in the court of appeals view by refusing to accede to the request to anonymise the article the applicant had not acted in the way that any prudent and diligent publisher would act in the same circumstances that refusal constituted a fault a simple search using gs first name and surname in the search engine on le soirs website or on google immediately brought up the article that was undoubtedly a source of damage to g at least of a nonpecuniary nature such a situation made knowledge of his previous conviction easily accessible to a wide audience and was thus liable to stigmatise him seriously damage his reputation and prevent him from reintegrating into society normally a causal link between the fault and the damage sustained had also been established acceding to gs request did not confer on each and every individual a subjective right to rewrite history nor did it make it possible to falsify history or impose an excessive burden of responsibility on the applicant the court of appeal was called upon to determine a specific dispute between two parties in the context of a oneoff civil action for damages based on article of the civil code while seeking to ensure that a balance was struck between two fundamental rights claimed by the parties the applicant further argued before the court of appeal that the way in which the database of le soir worked meant that it was not possible to alter archived articles and thus to replace gs name with the letter x the court of appeal noted that in support of his claims the applicant had submitted a report drawn up by the newspapers technical department however the court considered that the report in question which had been prepared after the applicant had been given notice to appear by technicians who were in a relationship of dependency with the applicant did not provide any guarantees of impartiality and had no probative value moreover the report did not state that it was actually impossible to implement the measure requested but simply referred to the risks and costs the only reference to impossibility concerned the physical impossibility of withdrawing the newspapers that had been sold the collections that had been distributed and the numerous copies of the content available in physical and digital format in the public domain something that had not been requested the applicant appealed on points of law in one of his grounds of appeal he alleged a violation of article of the convention in particular he argued in the first limb of the ground of appeal that the fault he had allegedly committed consisted in disregarding a subjective right namely the right to be forgotten although that right was not enshrined either in clear precise and accessible domestic legislation or in a higherranking international rule but was derived solely from the legal literature and caselaw hence in the applicants view the court of appeal judgment had breached the requirement that the interference be lawful in the second limb of the ground of appeal the applicant contended that the order for him to alter in the online archives the content of an article that had been published in the past and was available in the paper archives amounted to unjustified interference with his freedom of expression in breach of article of the convention in a judgment of april the court of cassation dismissed the appeal on points of law it found that the first limb of the ground of appeal arguing that the court of appeal had based the right to be forgotten online on the legal literature and caselaw failed on factual grounds the court of cassation held as follows it follows from the reasoning of the court of appeal judgment firstly that the judgment under challenge regards the right to be forgotten online as an intrinsic component of the right to respect for private life and indeed states so and views such interference with the right to freedom of expression as may be justified in order to protect that right as being based not on the legal literature and caselaw which the judgment does not recognise as having general regulatory scope but on article of the convention article of the international covenant on civil and political rights and article of the constitution and secondly that it refers to the judgment of the court of justice of the european union only to lend support to its view on the scope of that right to be forgotten as to the second limb the court of cassation held that the right to respect for private life which encompassed the right to be forgotten might justify interference with the right to freedom of expression the digital archiving of an old press article which at the time it was printed had lawfully reported on past events that were now covered by the right to be forgotten was not exempt from possible interference with the right to freedom of expression in order to protect the right to be forgotten such interference might consist in altering the archived text so as to prevent or make good a breach of the right to be forgotten the court of appeal had ruled lawfully that the online archiving of the article in question had amounted to a fresh disclosure of gs previous conviction that was liable to infringe his right to be forgotten the court of appeal had subsequently weighed up the rights of the parties and had provided legal justification for its ruling that the applicant by refusing to accede to the request for the article to be anonymised had committed a fault it had therefore lawfully ordered him to replace gs first name and surname with the letter x on the website of le soir accordingly the second limb of the ground of appeal had to be dismissed it appears that the article in question is still available on the newspapers website but is accessible only to subscribers it is accompanied by a notice referring to the relevant judicial decision relevant legal framework and practice domestic law and practiceprotection of the fundamental rights at stake and the right to be forgotten the belgian constitution

of the european parliament and of the council of october on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data was aimed at protecting

may case c euc google spain sl and google inc hereafter google spain the court of justice of the european union the cjeu was called upon to define the extent of the rights and obligations arising out of directive ec with regard to internet search engines the case originated in a complaint lodged by a spanish national with the spanish data protection agency against a spanish daily newspaper and google the applicant had complained that when an internet user entered his name in googles search engine the list of results displayed links to two pages of the newspaper mentioning his name in connection with an auction following attachment proceedings he had requested the newspaper either to remove or alter those pages so that the personal data relating to him no longer appeared or to use certain tools made available by search engines in order to protect his data he had also requested google to remove or conceal the personal data relating to him so that they ceased to be included in the search results and in the links to the newspaper while the spanish agency had rejected the complaint against the newspaper it had upheld the complaint against google which brought an action before the spanish courts it was in the context of this judicial dispute that the case was referred to the cjeu for a preliminary ruling the cjeu held that the operations carried out by operators of search engines should be classified as data processing of which they were the controllers article b and d regardless of the fact that these data had already been published on the internet and had not been altered by the search engine it stated that in so far as the activity of a search engine could be distinguished from and was additional to that carried out by publishers of websites and also affected the fundamental rights of the person concerned the operator of the search engine had to ensure in particular that the guarantees laid down by the directive could have full effect moreover given the ease with which information published on a website could be replicated on other sites effective and complete protection of data users and particularly of their right to privacy could not be achieved if they had to obtain first or in parallel the erasure of the information relating to them from the publishers of websites the cjeu concluded that the operator of a search engine was obliged to remove links to web pages that were published by third parties and contained information relating to a person from the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of that persons name including in cases where the name or information had not been erased beforehand or simultaneously from those web pages and even as applicable when its publication on those pages was in itself lawful the cjeu added that even initially lawful processing of accurate data could in the course of time become incompatible with the directive where those data were no longer necessary in the light of the purposes for which they had been collected or processed that was so in particular where they appeared to be inadequate irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive in relation to those purposes and in the light of the time that had elapsed the cjeu concluded that if under articles and of the european unions charter of fundamental rights guaranteeing respectively the right to respect for private life and the right to the protection of personal data the persons concerned had a right to ensure that the information in question relating to them personally should no longer be linked to their name by a list of results and they were thus entitled to request that the information in question no longer be made available to the general public on account of its inclusion in such a list of results those rights overrode as a rule not only the economic interest of the operator of the search engine but also the interest of the general public in having access to that information through a search relating to the names of the persons concerned however according to the cjeu that would not be the case if it appeared for particular reasons such as the role played by the persons concerned in public life that the interference with their fundamental rights was justified by the preponderant interest of the general public in having on account of its inclusion in the list of results access to the information in question regarding the difference in treatment between the publisher of a web page and the operator of a search engine the cjeu found as follows furthermore the processing by the publisher of a web page consisting in the publication of information relating to an individual may in some circumstances be carried out solely for journalistic purposes and thus benefit by virtue of article of directive from derogations from the requirements laid down by the directive whereas that does not appear to be so in the case of the processing carried out by the operator of a search engine it can not therefore be ruled out that in certain circumstances the data subject is capable of exercising the rights referred to in article b and subparagraph a of the first paragraph of article of directive against that operator but not against the publisher of the web page finally it must be stated that not only does the ground under article of directive justifying the publication of a piece of personal data on a website not necessarily coincide with that which is applicable to the activity of search engines but also even where that is the case the outcome of the weighing of the interests at issue to be carried out under article f and subparagraph a of the first paragraph of article of the directive may differ according to whether the processing carried out by the operator of a search engine or that carried out by the publisher of the web page is at issue given that first the legitimate interests justifying the processing may be different and second the consequences of the processing for the data subject and in particular for his private life are not necessarily the same indeed since the inclusion in the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of a persons name of a web page and of the information contained on it relating to that person makes access to that information appreciably easier for any internet user making a search in respect of the person concerned and may play a decisive role in the dissemination of that information it is liable to constitute a more significant interference with the data subjects fundamental right to privacy than the publication on the web page in the guidelines on the implementation of the court of justice of the european union judgment in the case of google spain sl and google inc v agencia española de protección de datos aepd and mario costeja gonzález c adopted on november the article data protection working party stated as follows search engines included in web pages do not produce the same effects as external search engines on the one hand they only recover the information contained on specific web pages on the other and even if a user looks for the same person in a number of web pages internal search engines will not establish a complete profile of the affected individual and the results will not have a serious impact on him therefore as a rule the right to delisting should not apply to search engines with a restricted field of action particularly in the case of search tools of websites of newspapers from the material point of view and as its been already mentioned the ruling expressly states that the right only affects the results obtained on searches made by the name of the individual and never suggests that the complete deletion of the page from the indexes of the search engine is needed the page should still be accessible using any other terms of search it is worth mentioning that the ruling uses the term name without further specification the second part of the guidelines concerns common criteria which the data protection authorities are invited to apply in handling complaints following refusals of delisting by search engines the relevant parts of the eighth and thirteenth criteria read as follows is the data processing causing prejudice to the data subject does the data have a disproportionately negative privacy impact on the data subject the data might have a disproportionately negative impact on the data subject where a search result relates to a trivial or foolish misdemeanour which is no longer or may never have been the subject of public debate and where there is no wider public interest in the availability of the information does the data relate to a criminal offence eu member states may have different approaches as to the public availability of information about offenders and their offences specific legal provisions may exist which have an impact on the availability of such information over time data protection authorities will handle such cases in accordance with the relevant national principles and approaches as a rule data protection authorities are more likely to consider the delisting of search results relating to relatively minor offences that happened a long time ago whilst being less likely to consider the delisting of results relating to more serious ones that happened more recently however these issues call for careful consideration and will be handled on a casebycase basis after the court of appeal had given its judgment in the present case regulation eu of the european parliament and of the council of april on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data the gdpr repealed directive ec of october article of the gdpr provides as follows article right to erasure right to be forgotten the data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds appliesa the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph to erase the personal data the controller taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation shall take reasonable steps including technical measures to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to or copy or replication of those personal data paragraphs and shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessarya for exercising the right of freedom of expression and informationd for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with article in so far as the right referred to in paragraph is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing after the delivery of the judgment in ml and ww v germany cited above the cjeu delivered two judgments on september relating to requests for a preliminary ruling concerning the obligation for operators of search engines to grant requests for delisting dereferencing the cases concerned are gc and others v commission nationale de linformatique et des libertés cnil c euc and google llc successor in law to google inc v commission nationale de linformatique et des libertés cnil c euc in the first judgment c the cjeu reiterated that the operators of search engines could be required to grant requests for dereferencing nevertheless when they received a request to that effect they had to weigh up the right to privacy and the right to protection of personal data of the person making the request for dereferencing against the freedom of information of internet users potentially interested in accessing the information in question the cjeu referred to the judgment in ml and ww v germany cited above inferring from it that it was for the operator of a search engine to assess in the context of a request for dereferencing relating to links to web pages on which information is published relating to criminal proceedings brought against the data subject whether in the light of all the circumstances of the case such as in particular the nature and seriousness of the offence in question the progress and the outcome of the proceedings the time elapsed the part played by the data subject in public life and his past conduct the publics interest at the time of the request the content and form of the publication and the consequences of publication for the data subject he or she has a right to the information in question no longer in the present state of things being linked with his or her name by a list of results displayed following a search carried out on the basis of that name in the second judgment c the cjeu specified that european union law did not require the operator of a search engine to carry out dereferencing on all versions of its search engine nevertheless it was required to do so on the versions of the search engine corresponding to all the member states and to put in place measures to discourage internet users conducting a search from one of the member states from gaining access to the links in question found on non eu versions of the search engine furthermore eu law did not prevent a supervisory or judicial authority of a member state from weighing up the fundamental rights at stake in the light of national standards of protection of fundamental rights and after weighing those rights against each other from ordering the operator of such a search engine where appropriate to carry out dereferencing concerning all versions of the search engine the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant alleged that the order for him to anonymise the archived version of the impugned article on the website of the newspaper le soir constituted a violation of freedom of expression freedom of the press and freedom to impart information he relied on article of the convention the relevant parts of which provide everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the court notes that the application is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merits the parties submissionsa the applicanti lawfulness of the interference the applicant submitted that the judgment against him had not been based on a clear and foreseeable law enabling him to foresee the legal consequences of his actions article of the civil code did not provide any clarification as to the type of restrictions allowed their purpose duration and scope or the possibility of reviewing them the right to be forgotten as established in a handful of decisions of the belgian courts applied only to newly published material and not to the digital reproduction of an original article that had been archived in unaltered form the court of appeal had drawn an analogy with the cjeu judgment in the case of google spain transposing the principles established in that judgment regarding a search engine to a newspaper publisher it had equated newspaper publishers with search engines without taking into account the fact that they were not subject to the same obligations as newspaper publishers were granted exemptions for journalistic purposes within the meaning of article of directive ce or the fact that the cjeu had expressly distinguished between these two types of activities furthermore the belgian courts had previously held that the protection of private life act of december did not impose a timelimit on the press beyond which any information had to be disseminated in anonymous form by the person responsible for the processing or by a third party see paragraph above that act also expressly permitted journalists to process judicial data in the applicants view something that was permitted under a specific law could not be prohibited by the ordinary rules on liability the applicant added that the few decisions that had sanctioned the right to be forgotten on the basis of article of the civil code set out criteria that had been the subject of novel and therefore unforeseeable interpretations finding as the court of appeal had done in the instant case that the proceedings were not designed to punish the disclosure of past events but to obtain the removal of information available online amounted to a substantial change in the criteria for applying the right to be forgotten hitherto recognised by the caselaw in the applicants view the extensive interpretation of those criteria by the court of appeal conferred an absolute and automatic character on the right to be forgotten which meant that with the passage of time it was possible to obtain the anonymisation of any electronic archive and hence of all newspaper judicial archives this would result in a gradual erosion of the integrity of the journalistic archives if it was possible for anyone to have the information made anonymous there was even a risk that the activity of archiving itself would disappear anonymisation therefore needed to be part of a particularly tight framework ensuring effective judicial review to prevent possible abuse lastly the applicant emphasised that the gdpr which incorporated the interpretation of the right to be forgotten given by the cjeu in its google spain judgment specifically provided for an exemption for the processing of data for archiving purposes in the public interest article d see paragraph aboveii necessity of the interference in the applicants view the judgment against him had not been strictly necessary in a democratic society the source of gs grievance was the fact that the article was indexed by search engines rather than the article as such it was search engines that brought the archives to light a decision should therefore have been taken to deindex the article rather than anonymising it as this was less restrictive of freedom of expression there were significant issues at stake in the present case as requests for anonymisation posed a serious threat to digital archiving recognising a right to be forgotten with regard to journalistic archives entailed a risk that this right would become a right to have information deleted or rewritten and hence a risk of undermining freedom to convey information and the very concept of archives which presupposed the existence of documents in their original unaltered form the order for the applicant to anonymise the archive in question would have a chilling effect on freedom of expression and freedom of the press and would ultimately prompt him to cease electronic archiving furthermore the belgian courts had not weighed up the competing interests at stake in accordance with the criteria established in the courts caselaw in particular the assessment as to whether g was known to the public had been incompatible with the courts caselaw according to which individuals could not complain of a loss of reputation which was a foreseeable consequence of their own actions such as the commission of a criminal offence as to the severity of the measure imposed the applicant submitted that other measures had existed that were less restrictive of freedom of expression such as making an addition to the news item published at the time referring to the order rehabilitating g or the delisting of the article by search engines such as google with regard to the last of these the applicant alleged that it had been up to g to submit a request for delisting to the operators of the search engines nevertheless in an effort to assist the applicant the newspapers legal department had itself requested google to delist the article in question but had received no response the applicant inferred from this that the reasons given by the court of appeal and upheld by the court of cassation were insufficient to demonstrate that the interference had been necessary in a democratic society the court of cassation had merely found that the court of appeal judgment had been legally justified without replying to the arguments raised by the applicant the applicant added that the right to be forgotten could not be transformed into a right for each individual to rewrite his or her personal history criminal convictions that had been the subject of public proceedings reported on by the press fell into the category of information that could legitimately be retained by the media the information could be delisted if the relevant criteria were satisfied but it could not be censoredb the governmenti lawfulness of the interference the government observed that the foreseeability of the law should not translate into excessive rigidity in the present case the judgment against the applicant was based on the provisions of the convention and the constitution guaranteeing the right to protection of private life of which the right to be forgotten formed a part and on article of the civil code which together constituted a sufficiently foreseeable legal basis hence the interference with freedom of expression did not stem either from the belgian legal literature or caselaw or from the cjeus google spain judgment it was acknowledged in the belgian ordinary rules on liability that a violation of the right to respect for private life of which the right to be forgotten was a part constituted a fault resulting from a breach of a written rule of conduct hence the applicant could not have been unaware that he might be held liable article of the civil code was sufficiently accessible clear precise and foreseeable taken together with article of the convention it formed a sufficiently foreseeable basis justifying interference with freedom of expression the fact that other courts whether in belgium or elsewhere had reached a different conclusion was irrelevant in so far as those courts had applied the same reasoning which had resulted in different outcomes depending on the specific circumstances of the cases before them in any event any exemptions allowed for journalists were not absolute and had to be weighed up in the light of the criteria established by the courtii necessity of the interference the government pointed out that neither the publics right to be informed about past events nor the right to create online archives was an absolute right in their view the initial interference with gs exercise of his right to respect for his private life stemmed from the decision of the publisher of le soir to publish the information in question and to keep it online albeit without drawing the publics attention to it the domestic courts had examined all the legal and technical arguments advanced by the parties and had imposed a proportionate measure on the applicant taking into account the range of different measures proposed by him in particular they had deemed it insufficient to add a comment to the online article the court of appeal had opted for the anonymisation of the article after weighing up the interests at stake the government stressed that the integrity of the archives as such was not impaired by the judgment given against the applicant but merely the publics access to the online version of the article the paper archives remained intact and people like researchers could still request access to the nonanonymised digital version of the article the case was to be distinguished from that of ml and ww v germany nos and june in view of the particular circumstances of the case and especially the fact that g was not well known the fact that he had had no contact with the media and the minimal interest of the events reported on in the article the information had become damaging precisely because of the passage of time and the article had been published online more than fifteen years after publication of the print version the present case was therefore also to be distinguished in terms of the facts from the judgment in węgrzynowski and smolczewski v poland no july in conclusion the government observed that the belgian courts had determined a specific dispute between two parties in the context of a civil action for damages while seeking to ensure that a balance was struck between two competing fundamental rights claimed by the parties they had taken their decisions after examining the criteria established by the court and striking a reasonable balance between the interests at stake there were therefore no sufficiently strong reasons for the court to substitute its assessment for that of the domestic courts submissions of the thirdparty intervener the thirdparty intervener g was the person who had requested anonymisation of his name in the article in issue in his view the applicant had displayed excessive zeal in objecting to the request as to the facts he pointed out in particular that although he had himself in the proceedings before the court of first instance proposed the use of a noindex tag as an alternative to anonymisation it was the applicant who had subsequently rejected that solution in gs view article of the civil code taken in conjunction with the right to be forgotten as recognised by the caselaw and legal literature as an integral part of the right to respect for private life constituted a sufficiently foreseeable legal basis satisfying the requirements of article of the convention as to the necessity of the interference he stressed the fact that the article belonged to the past which meant that it attracted a lesser degree of protection the significant repercussions of republication of the article on the internet as a result of the publication of the archives online and the complete lack of any public interest in the inclusion of his full name in the article furthermore it was not a question of requiring the media to remove all personal data from their archives as a blanket measure or to remove the data of anyone who so requested but of requiring them to assess the fundamental rights at stake in context the courts assessment it is not disputed that the civil judgment against the applicant ordering him to anonymise the impugned article amounted to interference with his rights under article of the convention an interference with the right to convey information or ideas will infringe the convention if it does not meet the requirements of paragraph of article it should therefore be determined whether the interference was prescribed by law whether it pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in that paragraph and whether it was necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve the relevant aim or aimsa lawfulness of the interference the applicant alleged that the judgment against him had not been foreseeable the general principles concerning the requirement of foreseeability of the law under article of the convention are summarised in the judgment in delfi as v estonia gc no echr see also more recently satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june magyar kétfarkú kutya párt v hungary gc no january and selahattin demirtaş v turkey no gc no december the court must seek to ascertain whether the way in which the domestic courts applied article of the civil code which constitutes the ordinary rules on liability to the applicants situation was foreseeable in so doing it will take account of the domestic legal framework as a whole that is to say both the written norms that were applied and the general principles stemming from the legislation and the caselaw see delfi as cited above the court observes at the outset that belgian law recognises a right to be forgotten as an integral part of the right to respect for private life see paragraph above as pointed out by the court of cassation in the present case that right flows from article of the convention article of the international covenant on civil and political rights and article of the constitution see paragraph above the court of appeal relied on these provisions in particular in recognising gs right to be forgotten see paragraph above interpreting the scope of the right to be forgotten is a matter for the national authorities notably the courts which have primary responsibility for interpreting domestic law unless the interpretation is arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable the courts role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of the interpretation are compatible with the convention see radomilja and others v croatia gc nos and march s v and a v denmark gc nos and others october and molla sali v greece gc no december the question raised by the applicant before the domestic courts was whether g satisfied the relevant criteria in order to claim the right to be forgotten in so far as in the applicants view the article in question was not newly published material but an archived version of an old article in this regard the court of cassation upheld the interpretation of the court of appeal which had found that the online publication of the archived version of the article amounted to fresh disclosure of gs previous conviction see paragraph above the court can not subscribe to the applicants view that the court of appeal in referring to the cjeu judgment in google spain had equated newspaper publishers with search engines as explained by the court of cassation the court of appeal had referred to the abovementioned judgment which concerned a search engine only for the purpose of determining the scope of the right to be forgotten per se in the courts view this interpretation by the national courts of the provisions concerning the protection of private life was neither arbitrary nor manifestly unreasonable returning to article of the civil code this provision requires a person to make good any damage caused through his or her fault including the unjustified infringement of a right this provision serves as the basis for civil actions for alleged abuse of press freedom see paragraph above accordingly the court is not persuaded by the applicants argument that it had not been foreseeable that judgment might be given against him on the basis of the ordinary rules on liability on account of an infringement of the right to be forgotten stemming from the digital reproduction of an old article it observes in that connection that the fact that a legal provision is applied for the first time in a certain type of case does not suffice to establish a lack of foreseeability see satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above magyar kétfarkú kutya párt cited above and selahattin demirtaş cited above likewise the fact that there are examples of cases in which the courts ruled differently is not sufficient to establish a lack of foreseeability since all the circumstances of the case must be taken into account in matters that involve the balancing of rights this is especially true since the caselaw to which the applicant referred had a different legal basis namely the protection of private life act of december see paragraph above see conversely rtbf v belgium no echr moreover the court notes that in previous cases examined under article of the convention it has accepted a provision constituting the ordinary rules on civil liability as a sufficiently foreseeable legal basis see with regard to article of the belgian civil code de haes and gijsels v belgium february reports of judgments and decisions i and leempoel sa ed ciné revue v belgium no november for cases concerning other states in which the interference with freedom of expression was also based on the ordinary rules of liability see for instance węgrzynowski and smolczewski cited above and ml and ww v germany cited above it follows from the foregoing that the judgment given against the applicant had a legal basis that satisfied the foreseeability requirement the interference was therefore prescribed by lawb legitimate aim the parties agreed that the interference had pursued a legitimate aim within the meaning of article namely the protection of the reputation or rights of others in this case gs right to respect for his private lifec necessity of the interference the court emphasises that as in the case of ml and ww v germany cited above it is not the lawfulness of the article when it was first published that is in issue but the fact that it was made available on the internet and the possibility of accessing the article a long time after the events the task of the national courts was to balance the various rights at stake the freedom of expression of the applicant as a publisher and in particular his right to convey information to the public on the one hand and gs right to protection of his private life on the other the court will first reiterate the principles concerning the balancing of the rights in issue and the criteria to be taken into account in assessing the necessity of an interference with freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the convention especially where as in the present case the issue concerns a digital archive available on the internet i it will then apply those criteria to the particular circumstances of the case iii the applicable general principlesα balancing of the rights the court refers to the general principles as set out in numerous judgments concerning the balancing of the rights guaranteed by articles and of the convention see among other authorities axel springer ag v germany gc no february couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no echr extracts bédat v switzerland gc no march and satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above as it has held repeatedly these rights as a matter of principle deserve equal respect see among other authorities axel springer ag cited above von hannover v germany no gc nos and cedh delfi as cited above and couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above and bédat cited above the court has already had occasion in examining an initial publication to lay down the relevant principles which must guide its assessment and more importantly that of the domestic courts as to whether an instance of interference was necessary it has thus identified a number of criteria in the context of balancing the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life the criteria are as follows i contribution to a debate of public interest ii whether the person concerned is known to the public and the subject of the news report iii the prior conduct of the person concerned iv the way in which the information was obtained and its veracity v the content form and consequences of the publication and vi the severity of the measure imposed see axel springer ag cited above and satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above and the references therein see also the cjeu judgment in gc and others v commission nationale de linformatique et des libertés cnil cited at paragraph above according to the courts caselaw the test of necessity in a democratic society requires the court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a pressing social need and in particular whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient and whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued see the sunday times v the united kingdom no april series a no and vavřička and others v the czech republic gc nos and others april the court further reiterates that under article of the convention the contracting states enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed under that provision is necessary however this margin goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those delivered by an independent court in exercising its supervisory function the courts task is not to take the place of the national courts but rather to review in the light of the case as a whole whether the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation are compatible with the provisions of the convention relied on see axel springer ag cited above where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see among other authorities axel springer ag cited above couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above bédat cited above and satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above β the specific nature of online publication of digital archives the great majority of cases concerning a conflict between the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life examined by the court have related to the initial publication of information about private aspects of the lives of individuals or their families see among many other authorities hachette filipacchi associés ici paris v france no july axel springer ag cited above couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above and more recently falzon v malta no march unlike those cases the present case concerns the online publication in and the continued availability to date of the archived version of an article originally published in in the print edition of the newspaper le soir in a situation where the lawfulness of the initial publication is not disputed in response to a request to that effect by g the domestic courts ordered the applicant to anonymise the digital archive of the impugned article by replacing gs full name with the letter x the court has previously held that in addition to its primary function the press has a secondary but nonetheless valuable role in maintaining archives containing news which has previously been reported and making them available to the public internet archives make a substantial contribution to preserving and making available news and information digital archives constitute an important source for education and historical research particularly as they are readily accessible to the public and are generally free see times newspapers ltd v the united kingdom nos and nos and and echr węgrzynowski and smolczewski cited above fuchsmann v germany no october and ml and ww v germany cited above in a case such as the present one the rights of a person who has been the subject of content available on the internet must therefore be balanced against the publics right to be informed about past events and contemporary history in particular through the use of digital press archives see ml and ww v germany cited above in that connection the court is keenly aware of the risk of a chilling effect on freedom of the press posed by a requirement for a publisher to anonymise an article whose lawfulness has not been questioned the obligation to examine at a later stage the lawfulness of keeping a report online following a request from the person concerned which implies weighing up all the interests at stake entails a risk that the press might refrain from keeping reports in its online archives or omit individualised elements in reports likely to be the subject of such a request see ml and ww v germany cited above the court is also mindful of the fact that the alteration of the archived version of an article undermines the integrity of the archives and thus their very essence the domestic courts must therefore be particularly vigilant whenever they grant a request for anonymisation or alteration of the electronic version of an archived article on the grounds of respect for private life that being said the right to keep archives available to the public online is not an absolute right but must be balanced against the other rights at stake in this context in the courts view the criteria to be taken into account regarding the online publication or continued availability of archived material are in principle the same as those applied by the court in the context of initial publication nevertheless certain criteria may have more or less relevance given the particular circumstances of the case and the passage of time see to similar effect ml and ww v germany cited above see also satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above ii application of these principles in the present caseα contribution to a debate of public interest as to the existence of a debate of public interest not diminished by the passage of time see ml and ww v germany cited above the court stresses the fact that by their very nature archives contribute to a debate of public interest in a different way from an initial publication above all digital archives constitute an important source for education and historical research see paragraph above and for placing current events in context the weight to be given to this criterion in balancing the interests at stake must therefore be tailored to the specific nature of such archives in the present case the court of appeal correctly observed that the online publication of the article did not have any value in terms of newsworthiness see paragraph above it held that twenty years after the events the identity of a person who was not a public figure did not enhance the public interest of the impugned article which merely contributed at a statistical level to a general debate on road safety the article concerned a series of admittedly tragic events whose contribution to a debate of public interest related mainly to the hazards of road traffic and the causes of those hazards hence the court notes the court of appeals finding that mentioning gs full name was not apt twenty years after the events to contribute to a debate of public interest see conversely ml and ww v germany cited above β whether the person concerned was known to the public and the subject of the article as to whether the person concerned was known to the public and the subject of the article it is true that the court has previously found as pointed out by the applicant that article of the convention can not be relied on in order to complain of a loss of reputation which is the foreseeable consequence of ones own actions such as the commission of a criminal offence see axel springer ag cited above gillberg v sweden gc no april medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june ml and ww v germany cited above and denisov v ukraine gc no september however this does not mean that a person with a past criminal conviction may never claim the right to be forgotten were this so that right would be devoid of substance the court considers that after a certain amount of time has passed persons who have been convicted may have an interest in no longer being confronted with their acts with a view to their reintegration in society see ml and ww v germany cited above and the references contained therein as stated by the court of appeal the electronic archiving of an article concerning the commission of an offence must not create a kind of virtual criminal record for the person concerned see paragraph above this is particularly true where as in the present case the person has served his or her sentence and been rehabilitated although after the commission of a criminal offence and while the trial is ongoing a hitherto unknown person may acquire a degree of notoriety that notoriety may also decline with the passage of time see ml and ww v germany cited above indeed the publics interest as regards criminal proceedings will vary in degree ibid thus in some cases the right to be forgotten may confer on the person concerned the right to revert to being simply an individual unknown to the public again time is a very important factor in this regard in the present case the court of appeal observed that g did not hold any public office see paragraph above he was a private individual unknown to the general public at the time of his request for anonymisation see conversely ml and ww v germany cited above the facts for which he had been convicted were not the subject of any media coverage with the exception of the impugned article either at the time of the events reported on or when the archived version of the article was published on the internetγ the conduct of the person concerned with regard to the media the domestic courts did not rule expressly on the issue of gs conduct with regard to the media the court notes that g did not at any time contact the media to publicise his situation either when the article first appeared in or when it was published online in see conversely ml and ww v germany cited above it is clear from his letters to le soir requesting the removal or anonymisation of the article see paragraph above that on the contrary he made every effort to stay out of the media spotlightδ how the information was obtained and its veracity the veracity of the facts related in the article was not disputed by g see mutatis mutandis ml and ww v germany cited above and conversely węgrzynowski and smolczewski cited above likewise g did not allege that the information had been obtained in breach of journalistic ethics moreover the court of appeal found that it was not disputed that the initial disclosure of the information had been lawful see paragraph aboveε the content form and consequences of the publication firstly as regards the content of the article in question it dealt with several roadtraffic accidents which had occurred within the space of a few days in the accident caused by g was one of them see paragraph above secondly with regard to the form of the publication an issue on which the domestic courts likewise did not rule expressly the court reiterates that internet sites are an information and communication tool particularly distinct from the printed media especially as regards the capacity to store and transmit information and that the risk of harm posed by content and communications on the internet to the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and freedoms particularly the right to respect for private life is certainly higher than that posed by printed publications see editorial board of pravoye delo and shtekel v ukraine no echr extracts węgrzynowski and smolczewski cited above delfi as cited above and ml and ww v germany cited above the court has inferred from this that the policies governing reproduction of material from the printed media and the internet may differ see editorial board of pravoye delo and shtekel cited above and węgrzynowski and smolczewski cited above the same is true as regards paper and digital archives as the scope of the latter is much greater and the repercussions on the private life of the individuals who are named are correspondingly more serious an effect that is further amplified by search engines as to the extent to which the archived version of the article was disseminated the court takes account of the fact that consulting archives requires an active search which involves entering keywords on the web page containing the newspapers archives given its location on the website the article in issue was not likely to attract the attention of those internet users who were not seeking information about g likewise the court does not doubt that maintaining access to the article was not intended to redisseminate information about g see to similar effect ml and ww v germany cited above the court nevertheless notes that in the instant case at the time of gs request and throughout the domestic proceedings access to the archives of the newspaper le soir was unrestricted and free of charge compare with ml and ww v germany cited above where certain articles were accessible only behind a paywall or for subscribers the applicant pointed out that in the present case the judgment had not been against the operator of the search engine but against the publisher of a newspaper whose articles were accessible online like the cjeu the court accepts that the obligations of search engines may differ from those of the entity which originally published the information see ml and ww v germany cited above see also paragraph above it is also true that it is primarily because of search engines that the information on individuals that is held by the media outlets concerned can easily be found by internet users see ml and ww v germany cited above however it can not be overlooked that the very fact that a newspaper posts an article on its website has an impact on the visibility of the information in question thus the initial interference with gs right to respect for his private life resulted from the applicants decision to publish that information on his website and especially to keep it available there even without the intention of attracting the publics attention ibid thirdly as to the consequences of publication the court of appeal noted that a simple search using gs first name and surname on the search engine of le soir or on google immediately brought up the article see paragraph above the court of appeal held that keeping the impugned article online was therefore liable to cause indefinite and serious harm to gs reputation by giving him as already observed see paragraph above a virtual criminal record despite the fact that he had not only served his sentence after a final conviction for the offence but had also been formally rehabilitated in the courts view this assessment by the court of appeal can not be regarded as arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable with the passage of time individuals should have the opportunity to rebuild their lives without being confronted with their past mistakes by members of the public see mutatis mutandis österreichischer rundfunk v austria no december and ml and ww v germany cited above name searches have become commonplace in todays society and more often than not people conduct such searches for reasons wholly unconnected to any prosecution or conviction of the person concernedστ the severity of the measure imposed on the applicant lastly as regards the severity of the measure imposed on the applicant the court must seek to ascertain whether the domestic courts took into account the impact of the measure on the applicant and le soir and whether they examined within the limits of the case before them whether other measures less restrictive of freedom of expression could be considered the court notes that in the proceedings before the domestic courts the applicant maintained that a balance between the rights at stake could be achieved by means of a right to rectification or communication that is to say by adding further information to the impugned article the court of appeal took the view that such a procedure would not be appropriate in the present case as it would allow the stigmatising effect of the offences committed by g and of the sentence he had already served to persist indefinitely and would render the rehabilitation order given in his favour meaningless before the court the applicant subsequently alleged that the court of appeal had not made clear why the addition by le soir of a noindex tag would be insufficient to secure gs right to respect for his private life he also alleged referring in particular to the cjeus google spain judgment that g should have asked search engines like google to delist the impugned article the court notes that in the court of appeal proceedings the applicant argued that only the search engines were competent to deal with gs request and that the latter had erroneously directed his request against the applicant as to the addition by le soir of a noindex tag on the article it does not appear from the documents in the domestic case file to which the court has access that the applicant argued before the lower courts that the addition of such a tag would suffice to secure gs right to respect for private life in any event the court of appeal noted that at the time of delivery of its judgment the article in question was still available on the website of le soir without any noindex tag as to the delisting of the article by search engines the court considers that the relevance of such a measure is to be assessed in the context of the case brought before the courts as gs request was directed against the applicant alone the courts can not be criticised for simply examining the admissibility and merits of that request it is true that it was open to le soir to take the initiative and itself request the search engines to delist the article in question in response to the request it had received from g to ensure respect for his private life the applicant stated that the newspapers legal department had in fact contacted google for that purpose but had received no reply see paragraph above as g did not request delisting of the article by the search engines in the context of his dispute with the applicant and the latter did not have it delisted as an alternative to anonymisation the court considers it unnecessary to examine in the abstract whether delisting was apt to achieve a fair balance between the interests at stake likewise in so far as the matter was not raised in the proceedings before the domestic courts it is not the courts task to consider of its own motion possible alternative methods less restrictive of the applicants right to freedom of expression that might have been used in the present case the court of appeal took the view that the most effective means of protecting gs privacy without disproportionately interfering with the applicants freedom of expression was to anonymise the article posted on le soirs website by replacing gs first name and surname with the letter x see paragraph above in reply to an argument advanced by the applicant it stressed the fact that he had not been requested to remove the article from the archives but simply to render the electronic version anonymous the paper archives remained intact and the applicant could still ensure the integrity of the original digital version see paragraph above replying to a further argument by the applicant citing the technical impossibility of altering archived articles the court of appeal considered that the impossibility of doing so had not been established see paragraph above with regard to archives the court attaches considerable weight to the fact that the nature of the measure imposed in the present case preserved the integrity of the archived article since it was only a matter of anonymising the online version of the article and the applicant was allowed to keep the original digital and paper archives as pointed out by the government this meant in particular that anyone interested in the original version of the article could still request access to it including in digital form see paragraph above it was therefore not the article itself but merely the ability to access it on the website of le soir that was affected by the measure as to the court of appeals assessment of the technical feasibility for the applicant of anonymising the article on the website of le soir the applicant did not adduce any evidence capable of persuading the court that this assessment was arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable in view of the foregoing the court considers that the national courts were entitled to conclude that the test as to the proportionality of the interference with the right to freedom of expression was satisfied see paragraph aboveiii conclusion in the light of the considerations outlined above the court considers that the domestic courts weighed in the balance gs right to respect for his private life and the applicants right to freedom of expression in accordance with the criteria established in its caselaw specifically the court of appeal attached particular weight to the damage sustained by g on account of the online publication of the article in question having regard in particular to the passage of time since the publication of the original article and to the fact that the anonymisation of the article on the website of le soir left the archives themselves intact and constituted the most effective measure amongst those that could have been taken in the present case without interfering disproportionately with the applicants freedom of expression in the courts view the reasons given by the domestic courts were relevant and sufficient it sees no strong reason which would require it to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts and to set aside the balancing exercise carried out by them it therefore finds that the measure imposed can be regarded as proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and as striking a fair balance between the competing rights at stake accordingly in the specific circumstances of the present case there has been no violation of article of the convention the court wishes to make it clear that its finding can not be interpreted as entailing an obligation for the media to check their archives on a systematic and permanent basis without prejudice to their duty to respect private life at the time of the initial publication of an article when it comes to archiving the article they are required to carry out a check and thus weigh the rights at stake only if they receive an express request to that effect for these reasons the courtdeclares unanimously the application admissible holds by six votes to one that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in french and notified in writing on june pursuant to rule and of the rules of court signature_p_milan blaško georgios a serghides registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the separate opinion of judge pavli is annexed to this judgment gasmbdissenting opinion of judge pavli the current case involves a conflict between the right of the press and the general public to preserve the integrity of press archives versus the right of an individual not to be confronted with a permanent criminal record in the online domain which is one aspect of what has come to be known as the right to be forgotten on the facts it is a situation whereby one persons right to online privacy can be quite effectively protected at the level of search engines without it being necessary to interfere directly with the relevant archived material a situation that by definition raises serious questions of necessity in a democratic society it is a crucial consideration that has been ignored by the domestic rulings which the majority upholds based on a weak procedural argument and with little attention to the general ramifications of this potentially farreaching judgment in my view by ordering the applicant to anonymise an archived online article containing information about an old crime committed by the plaintiff in the domestic proceedings mr g the belgian courts failed to strike a fair balance between the competing interests protected by article and article of the convention respectively in ratifying the balancing exercise carried out by the national courts the judgment goes against an emerging but clear european consensus that righttobeforgotten claims in the online realm can and should be effectively addressed through deindexation of search engine results while preserving the integrity of the original historical material unless the privacy claimant can show that for some exceptional reason deindexation would not be sufficient or adequate in the specific case finally the methodological approach followed by the majority in applying the von hannover criteria to the current case is also questionable in my view the essential role of digital press archives i recall at the outset that the court has repeatedly emphasised the substantial contribution made by digital press archives to preserving and making available news and information thereby constituting an important source for education and historical research see węgrzynowski and smolczewski v poland no july and times newspapers ltd v the united kingdom nos and nos and echr the maintenance of internet archives is a critical aspect of the role of the press in a democracy ibid the court has further noted that even with respect to defamatory material it is not the role of judicial authorities to engage in rewriting history by ordering the removal from the public domain of all traces of publications which have in the past been found by final judicial decisions to amount to unjustified attacks on individual reputations see węgrzynowski and smolczewski cited above it follows a fortiori that only very compelling reasons can justify direct interference with archived media content whose legality at the time of the original publication has not been questioned retrospective cleansing of digital press archives interferes not only with the publics article right to be informed about past events and contemporary history but also with the publishers freedom of journalistic expression protected by the same provision in this context the court has recognised that granting such anonymisation requests can have a broader chilling effect on freedom of expression according to the court the obligation to examine the lawfulness of a report at a later stage following an anonymisation request from the person concerned which implies weighing up all the interests at stake would entail a risk that the press might refrain from keeping reports in its online archives or that it would omit individualised elements in reports likely to be the subject of such a request see ml and ww v germany nos and june the court observed in that regard that the most careful scrutiny under article is required where measures or sanctions imposed on the press are capable of discouraging the participation of the press in debates on matters of legitimate public concern ibid to fulfil their article function digital press archives must be complete and historically accurate any tampering with their content could undermine their underlying purpose which is to maintain a full historical record keeping in mind also that it is not possible to know beforehand which particular information stored in them will at some future point become of renewed public interest for example journalists and others have a legitimate interest in building a moral profile of a political candidate by gathering or crosschecking various facts about his or her past in such a situation the persons criminal record may gain new significance whether or not any prior convictions are considered to be spent see jankauskas v lithuania no no june where the court found that spent convictions can legitimately be relied on for the purposes of evaluating a persons moral stature in the case of emergent public figures the watchdog function can be seriously compromised if press archives have in the meantime been unnecessarily sanitised in view of the above there is little scope under the convention for measures that have the effect of permanently interfering with the historical record i should note at this point that it makes little difference that the historical material has been left untouched in the printed version of the archive considering that presentday newsgathering investigative journalism and scholarly research rely to a great degree on online sources in fact the court has stressed that the importance of digital press archives stems particularly from the fact that they are readily accessible to the public and are generally free see ml and ww v germany cited above while a persons privacy and right to rehabilitation should be generally protected from the casual curiosity of the online masses that does not necessarily justify the complete erasure of the historical record emerging european consensus on the right to be forgotten it is important to consider the case at hand in the context of the emerging european consensus on balancing private and public interests in cases involving press archives an important reference in this regard is the cjeus ruling in google spain to which todays judgment refers extensively see paragraphs of the judgment at issue in google spain was an archived online article fully lawful at the time of publication containing a persons name in connection with an auction that followed attachment proceedings the cjeu established a data protection remedy that consists in delisting web pages containing personal data from namebased search engine results but ensuring that no information gets deleted or altered in the original source the cjeus reasoning rested in part on the distinction between the legal regime applicable to general search engines and that applicable to primary publishers with the crucial difference being that only the latter can benefit from journalistic exemptions under european union data protection principles the cjeu pointed out that as a result of this difference the data subject will in certain circumstances be capable of exercising his data protection rights against the search engine operator but not against the publisher of the web page see paragraph of the cjeu judgment in the same vein the outcome of the weighing of the competing interests at issue may be different in each of the two scenarios given that first the legitimate interests justifying the processing may be different and second the consequences of the processing for the data subject and in particular for his private life are not necessarily the same paragraph regarding specifically the consequences of data processing for private life the cjeu found that the inclusion of a web page in namebased search results is liable to constitute a more significant interference with the data subjects fundamental right to privacy than the publication on the web page given that the inclusion of information in the search results makes access to that information appreciably easier for any internet user making a search in respect of the person concerned and may play a decisive role in the dissemination of that information paragraph in this connection it is important to bear in mind that general search engines have a transformational impact on personal privacy because they allow users to build a complete profile of a persons life drawing on practically every piece of information available online in a way that was not possible in the pre internet days this makes general search engines unique in a way that does not apply to digital press archives or even the search engine of one individual website in continuity with previous eu data protection rules and the google spain judgment the upgraded eu general data protection regulation gdpr expressly lays down the right to erasure of personal data on grounds enumerated in article this right is however subject to limitation to the extent that processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information article a the gdpr also provides for exemptions and derogations for processing carried out for journalistic purposes if they are necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the freedom of expression and information article recital of the gdpr makes it clear that this applies in particular to the processing of personal data in news archives and press libraries in the years since the google spain judgment delisting of namebased search results has become a wellestablished and functional remedy in europe in cases concerning righttobeforgotten claims relating to press publications there is in fact strong comparative evidence pointing towards a reluctance on the part of domestic courts to edit the past by anonymising archives with remedies at the level of search engines being favoured instead by way of example i refer to a recent judgment of the spanish constitutional court in a b v ediciones el país which dealt with facts not dissimilar to those at issue in the current case the constitutional court held that once access to the online article in question had been impeded through its deindexation from general search engines and from the internal search engine of el país it was no longer necessary to alter its content to satisfy the privacy claim since the dissemination of the article had been reduced both quantitatively and qualitatively by disassociating it from the identity of the persons concerned also notable is a judgment of the german federal constitutional court of november which introduced a nuanced methodology for balancing private and public interests in cases concerning digital press archives with an emphasis on examining all available technical options before resorting to altering the historical record directly while leaving the balancing exercise in casu to the ordinary courts the high german court stressed that the aim is to strike a balance that preserves unrestricted access to the original texts to the greatest extent possible while also ensuring that where protection is merited in the individual case especially in relation to namebased searches via search engines sufficient limitations are put in place paragraph in its methodological guidance to the lower courts the federal constitutional court focused on the actual dissemination and visibility of the original publication on the internet see paragraphs and an aspect that is also crucial in the present case the allterrain von hannover criteria turning now to our own methodology for considering righttobeforgotten requests the majority have resorted to the criteria developed in von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr as the general matrix for resolving conflicts between article and article interests in fairness the court has previously followed the same approach in ml and ww v germany cited above the deployment of the von hannover criteria together with the similar but not identical test adopted in axel springer ag v germany gc no february in order to resolve all conflicts ranging from invasion of privacy to defamation disputes and now matters of informational selfdetermination has generated a measure of criticism from both outside and inside the court it has been argued for example that defamation cases differ in many significant respects from privacy torts and that at least some of the criteria developed in von hannover are not equally relevant or transposable to the reputational context i have some sympathy for this line of argument considering that it may be somewhat rigid and overambitious to seek to apply a single set of criteria to the very diverse range of conflicts that may arise between article and interests this is especially so in view of the growing scope and diversity of claims that the court has recognised as falling with the remit of article be that as it may the current context raises an even more challenging question why should the von hannover criteria be applied by default to a dispute about a publication whose original legality is not in question and whose courtordered editing is requested in the name of substantially different considerations for example the notoriety of the person concerned or the contribution of the material to matters of public interest are much more easily assessable at the moment of the original publication in contrast when interference with the archived material is requested many years after the events it is also necessary to consider the potential utility and relevance of the publication at some future time this is an inherently uncertain ponderation and therefore the presumption must be in favour of not interfering directly with original archive material for these reasons i fear that the von hannover criteria may have reached the limit of their usefulness in this context it is worth recalling here that the eu regulatory framework on the right to be forgotten relies on a simpler set of criteria that are more germane to the context of personal data protection though certainly not without their own interpretative challenges delisting versus editing of the press archive in the present case turning to the merits of the present case i do not question that the plaintiff in the domestic proceedings had a legitimate article interest in not being casually confronted with his spent conviction with a view to his reintegration in society it is however important to pinpoint where exactly that interest lay he took the initial steps against le soir because he realised that the article at issue appeared among the top search results when his name was typed into search engines see paragraph of the judgment in his submissions to this court mr g sought to demonstrate the impact of the archived article on his private life precisely by reference to the fact that the article featured prominently in the search results linked to his name on a major search engine and on the internal search engine of le soir see paragraph of the thirdparty submissions it is also notable even though not decisive that mr g was prepared to accept as an alternative remedy the delisting of the article from search engine results for queries containing his name should anonymisation of the article prove technically impossible see paragraph of the judgment it is clear from the above that the plaintiffs root concern was with the online search results not the article itself with this in mind his legitimate interest in not being confronted with the article in question in his daily personal and professional life could have been adequately protected by removing the article from namebased search results on general search engines according to current statistics more than percent of belgian internet users tend to use one of two major search engines such a measure would have prevented the article from becoming easily accessible through curiositydriven or other random search queries at the same time it would have preserved the integrity of the press archives and allowed full access to the unaltered original source to those persons journalists researchers or others who might become specifically interested in the past events covered in the article while delisting remains a significant interference with the freedom to receive and impart information and ideas it is still less onerous for the applicant and less detrimental to his article rights it can not be excluded that in certain circumstances a privacy interest may be so strong as to warrant the anonymisation of an archived news article where a person makes a compelling case that the harm caused to him or her as a result of an online publication can not be undone by delisting other remedies may need to be considered put differently for anonymisation to be compatible with article a person must show that substantial harm to his or her private life does not result merely from a piece of information being easily discoverable but rather from the fact that the information continues to exist in the online space at all for example when it involves particularly sensitive personal data or especially vulnerable persons however no such special circumstances are present in the instant case how do the majority deal with this conundrum they find that since the plaintiff had not requested deindexation from the search engine and had in fact chosen to go after the newspaper archive it was not for the national courts or for this court to consider possible alternatives in the abstract see paragraph of the judgment in other words because the plaintiff has demanded that the neighbours wall be taken down in order to get rid of some graffiti on it let the plaintiff have his wish alternatives and proportionality be damned i am not persuaded that the belgian courts seriously considered any readily available alternatives to direct interference with the archived material in this case the majority have therefore upheld domestic decisions that failed to engage in the kind of careful balancing that other national and supranational courts across the continent have sought to develop in this delicate context while one ought to have sympathy for the predicament of the plaintiff in the domestic proceedings we can not ignore the broader consequences of the precedent we are creating in conclusion todays judgment stands in strong tension with the principles of our own jurisprudence on the integrity of press archives as well as the emerging european consensus on the application of the right to be forgotten in adopting this judgment the court may have opened the door with no good reason in my view to the facile cleansing of the journalistic record case c euc google spain sl and google inc it is notable that the liège court of appeal took note of google spain in its decision in the case at hand and was therefore aware of the newly established remedy see paragraph of the judgment see article data protection working party guidelines on the implementation of the court of justice of the european union judgment in the case of google spain sl and google inc v agencia española de protección de datos aepd and mario costeja gonzález c adopted on november see for instance the recent judgment of the high court of england and wales in nt and nt v google and the information commissioner ewhc qb and the judgment of the french court of cassation first civil division may no judgment june bv r november see among others h

although in a more specific context the joint dissenting opinion of judges sajó and karakaş in satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june see paragraph above i am also unable to follow the majoritys suggestion that the applicant entity should have requested deindexation from the search engines while the rightsholder was not prepared to do so himself this would be against the principles of data protection and it is not surprising that the search engine failed to act on a third partys request,,,

asked by the sheriff if he wished the services of a lawyer but replied that he did not he maintained his plea of not guilty the sheriff indicated that he risked being found in contempt of court if he failed to put on clothes the applicant refused to dress the sheriff allowed him to be present in court after a screen covering the lower half of his body was hastily constructedi the evidence the two police officers who had arrested the applicant gave evidence police officer a described edinburgh road as a major route into perth from the motorway it was a busy road and at the material time there was a continuous flow of traffic along the road he was firmly of the view that the applicants nudity in a public place would cause alarm to anyone during crossexamination by the applicant police officer a agreed that the human body was in itself decent and was not harmful or alarming he accepted that nothing in the applicants behaviour at the time of his arrest other than his nakedness gave the police any cause for concern police officer b gave evidence that she considered the fact that the applicant had no clothes on in a public place to be very strange and unusual and that she was quite shocked by it she explained that at the time edinburgh road had been very busy with vehicular and pedestrian traffic she had previously seen elderly people and children in the area and there were schools and housing nearby in crossexamination she also agreed that the human body in itself was not harmful indecent or bad but maintained that although she had been forewarned that she would be likely to see a naked man in public she had still been shocked she confirmed that no complaints had been received from members of the public the applicant gave evidence in his defence when asked by the prosecution why he was wearing no clothes he replied that he was making a stand and that were innocent until we do something wrong he did not believe that he was causing harm by not wearing clothes he said that he did not wear clothes in order to provoke a reaction although he had not always been like that as he had grown older he had thought more about his beliefs when asked what he hoped to achieve by making his stand the applicant replied that he did it because he felt that it was right and that the world changed in its own wayii the conviction and sentence the sheriff found the applicant guilty of breach of the peace and contempt of court he considered that being naked in a public place and refusing to wear clothes in a public place was conduct that would be alarming and disturbing in its context to any reasonable person in his stated case prepared in the context of the applicants later appeal the sheriff explained there was no dispute on the facts of the case i accepted that the police officers were concerned that if the appellant did not put clothes on there was a very real likelihood of him causing fear and alarm to other members of the public he continued the position of the appellant is somewhat difficult to understand he made it clear to the two police officers that he had no intention whatsoever of putting clothes on he insisted on being naked in a public place he believed that he was doing no wrong by being naked in a public place he did not accept that he had committed an offence he noted that in questioning the police officers the applicant had chosen not to differentiate between private and public places when it came to nakedness he concluded i was entirely satisfied that the conduct of the appellant with the aggravation of his refusal to wear clothing in a public place amounted to a breach of the peace the criteria for a breach of the peace as discussed in the case of smith v donnelly had been met the evidence of the appellant did not raise a doubt in my mind accordingly i convicted the appellant as libelled at sentencing the sheriff had before him the applicants previous convictions according to the stated case the applicant confirmed to the sheriff that all previous convictions were for breach of the peace the sheriffs stated case continued he acknowledged that he had spent the last five years or thereby in prison for the same offence a pattern has emerged namely that on his release from prison when he stepped out of the prison gate always naked he was immediately arrested i asked the appellant what he was hoping to achieve by insisting on being naked in public he talked about his beliefs i simply could not understand what he had to say in this regard he did not appear to be waging any campaign or making a protest he informed me that he would rather not be in prison if he was not in prison he would go back to live with his mother in a village in cornwall he had previously worked as a driver of large goods vehicles the sheriff discussed sentencing options with the applicant in his stated case he explained i enquired of him if i was minded to defer sentence for whatever reason and admit him to a bail order would he then wear clothes after some thought the appellant stated that he would not be prepared to wear clothes the sheriffs stated case concluded taking all these matters into account i could see no alternative to a custodial sentence in view of the content of the notice of previous convictions i deemed it appropriate to impose the maximum of months imprisonment which i backdated to the date that he had been taken into custody a further four months imprisonment to run concurrently was imposed for contempt of courtc the appeal the applicant sought to appeal his conviction and sentence by way of note of appeal and a draft stated case was prepared by the sheriff in september the applicant was provided with a copy of the stated case and was asked for details of any proposed changes by letter of october the applicant proposed a number of changes on october a hearing was held to consider the proposed adjustments to the case stated the applicant was brought from hmp perth to attend the hearing and blankets were provided to facilitate his attendance he was told that if he refused to wear clothes or make use of the blankets he would not be admitted into the court he refused to wear clothes or to make use of the blankets and was accordingly not permitted to attend the adjustment hearing the hearing proceeded in his absence and his requested adjustments were considered by the sheriff two adjustments were allowed and the remaining adjustments rejected concerned that the stated case was biased the applicant did not lodge it with the justiciary office on october the expiry of the applicable timelimit for lodging his appeal was deemed abandoned the applicant spent his sentence in segregation at hmp perth as he refused to wear clothes on december he was released from prison the december arrest minutes after his release on december the applicant was arrested and charged with breach of the peace for being naked in public he was detained on remand on january he was convicted of breach of the peace sentence was deferred to february for uptodate psychiatric and psychological assessments on february the applicant was sentenced to a term of twelve months imprisonment plus days unserved from previous sentences he lodged an appeal the outcome of the appeal is not known he was kept in segregation at hmp perth while in prison because he refused to dress he was released on october the october arrest minutes after his release on october the applicant was arrested and charged with breach of the peace for being naked in public he was detained on remand on november he was found guilty of breach of the peace and contempt of court on november he was sentenced to days imprisonment in respect of the breach of the peace charge together with days unserved from previous sentences plus days for contempt of court to be served consecutively he was not kept in segregation while in prison at hmp perth he was released on july the july arresta the arrest minutes after his release on july at around am the applicant was approached by two police officers on manson terrace a public road leading from hmp perth to edinburgh road the officers suggested that he put on some clothes but he refused to do so he was arrested him for breach of the peace and detained on remand he appeared in court on july and pleaded not guiltyb the trial proceedings the trial commenced on august the applicant appeared in court naked and was warned by the sheriff that if he refused to dress or to cover himself he might be held in contempt of court he refused to put on clothesi the evidence the prosecution led evidence of two police officer witnesses at trial their evidence was similar to that given at the trial and the applicants crossexamination was also in similar terms and elicited similar responses see paragraph above the applicant did not give evidence in his defence he argued that his arrest and trial violated the convention he relied inter alia on article arguing that there was no reasonable suspicion which would satisfy an objective observer that he had committed an offence article arguing that his arrest was arbitrary as it was based on the subjective belief that his nakedness was offensive article arguing that he had a strong view that there was nothing indecent about his body and that view was not being respected article arguing that he ought to have been given the right to express his views that nakedness was not indecent in the way that he had chosen to do and article arguing that he was being discriminated against because he had different views from the majority of peopleii the conviction and sentence the sheriff found that the applicants conduct on july was severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people threatened serious disturbance to the community and presented as genuinely alarming in its context to any reasonable person he therefore convicted the applicant in his stated case prepared in the context of the later appeal proceedings the sheriff referred to the applicants convention arguments and continued i should say that none of these arguments were developed to any extent and it was not always easy to see what the applicants full argument was i came to the conclusion that none of the articles suggested by the appellant had been contravened in the procedure as to the conviction handed down he explained in my view there was no doubt about the facts in this case the question was whether the conduct amounted to a breach of the peace i was of the view that the first part of the test was easily met by the conduct the appellant was walking along a public street in full view of anyone passing and he was completely naked with his private parts entirely on show such conduct would be severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people especially when it was being carried out in an ordinary public street it might be different if he had been naked somewhere in private even in a public place which was remote or where fewer people would be congregated but in or near one of the main streets of a busy town his appearance in that state would be alarming the question which was more troubling was whether the second part of the test was met would the conduct cause serious disturbance to the community i came to the conclusion that the context in which the conduct was taking place being naked in a brazen fashion in the public street with no attempt to cover himself and no obvious explanation or reason for the conduct would cause serious disturbance to the community because of the reaction of ordinary people to his presence in that state in that place that would be particularly so if the community could see that children or vulnerable old people might be present i considered that the test was met and that the charge was proved beyond reasonable doubt i therefore found the appellant guilty the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of days for the breach of the peace and days for the contempt charge together with days unspent from his previous sentence a total of days the sentences were not backdated and they were to run consecutively the total length of the sentence was therefore one year nine months and eighteen daysc the appeal the applicant sought to appeal his conviction by way of note of appeal and a draft stated case was prepared by the sheriff adjustments to the stated case were proposed by both parties and a hearing was held the applicant was not permitted to attend the hearing since he refused to wear clothes on october the applicant lodged an appeal by way of case stated relying on articles and of the convention on november the applicants application for leave to appeal was considered by the first sift judge leave was refused for the following reasons the appeal is not arguable the sheriff has carefully explained the reasons for arriving at his decision there was no infringement of the appellants rights in terms of the european convention on human rights on december the applicant was refused leave on the second sift the judges found that for the reasons given by the first sift judge the appeal was not arguable the applicant was not kept in segregation while serving his sentence at hmp perth he was released on july subsequent arrests in scotland on the same day the applicant was arrested and charged with breach of the peace he was not held in custody on august a decision was made to take no further action meanwhile on july he was arrested on the outskirts of dunfermline and charged with breach of the peace he was detained on remand and appeared at kirkcaldy sheriff court in august he was convicted of breach of the peace and detained at hmp edinburgh and hmp kilmarnock he was kept in segregation during his detention he was released on october and headed south towards his home in eastleigh b treatment while in prison background factsa medical treatment regarding lump on testicle in april the applicant discovered a lump on his right testicle he was examined in his cell but was required to wear clothes for external appointments he refused to dress and subsequently made prison complaints about alleged inadequate medical treatment when they were unsuccessful he referred the complaints to the scottish ministers but on august he was informed that they were not upheld the applicant then contacted the scottish public services ombudsman the ombudsman however he was advised that his complaint was not one which the ombudsman could pursue on february he was told that the lump had goneb visits from family and friends on august the applicant made a prison complaint that he was not allowed visits he was told in reply that he was permitted visits provided that he was appropriately dressed he referred the complaint to the internal complaints committee icc on september he was advised on september that the icc had fully endorsed the suggestion that visits be accommodated in the segregation unit he was told to discuss this with the relevant staff and book a visit no visits took place on november the applicant contacted the ombudsman with a complaint that the scottish prison service sps was unreasonably refusing to enable him to receive visits by letter dated january he was informed that the ombudsman had not upheld the complaint because according to information from the sps he had been asked to cover his genitalia when walking from a hall where he was detained to the segregation unit he had refused to do soc general dental and medical treatment on september the applicant made a prison complaint about refusal of dental and general medical treatment over the previous five years while he was in detention by reply dated september he was advised that the full range of clinical services were available to prisoners and that he was required to comply with the dress code to attend appointments he referred the complaint to the scottish ministers who did not uphold his complaintd association with other prisoners and exercise as noted above the applicant spent much of his detention in segregation even when not in segregation his ability to participate in activities and to associate with other prisoners was generally limited as long as he remained naked he was not permitted to access the gym for health and safety reasons however efforts were made to give him access to books and to explore further work or hobbies that could be conducted in his cell throughout his time in segregation the applicant was reviewed regularly by health care professionals on january the applicant complained to the prison authorities that he was not allowed to associate with other prisoners or to exercise by reply dated january he was told that he was not being denied association or exercise but had excluded himself from these activities by refusing to wear clothes the applicant referred the complaint to the icc on february but the icc decided that the current arrangements were satisfactory it noted that if the applicant were to wear clothes he would be permitted to associate with other prisoners however his choice to remain naked gave rise to serious concerns that he might be the victim of violence or unwarranted comments and the prison had an obligation to ensure his safety in march the applicant complained to the ombudsman that the sps had given an unreasonable explanation for denying him access to association and exercise by reply dated may the ombudsman informed him that his complaint had not been upheld because prison staff had confirmed that if he wore clothes he would be able to associate with other prisoners and exercise attempts to secure legal representation and exemption from court fees the applicant contacted the law society of scotland seeking details of solicitors in edinburgh experienced in judicial review he received a list containing the names of fourteen firms which he duly contacted none were willing to represent him however a further seven firms were recommended to him he contacted them and was informed that none were willing to represent him he then contacted the court of session to request information regarding exemption from court fees with a view to commencing judicial review proceedings without legal assistance he was advised that as he was a prisoner and not in receipt of any state benefits he was not eligible for exemption from court fees ii relevant domestic law and practicea criminal offences in scotland breach of the peace the leading case as to what constitutes a breach of the peace under scots law is smith v donnelly slt where the appeal court said the crime of breach of the peace can be committed in a wide variety of circumstances and in many cases it is a relatively minor crime it has therefore been said more than once that a comprehensive definition which would cover all possible circumstances is neither possible nor desirable equally in our view it is neither possible nor desirable to derive a comprehensive definition from a close analysis of the facts of individual cases in which it has been held that a breach of the peace had been committed it is in our view clear that what is required to constitute the crime is conduct severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people and threaten serious disturbance to the community what is required therefore it seems to us is conduct which does present as genuinely alarming and disturbing in its context to any reasonable person that interpretation is supported by the fact that if there is no evidence of actual alarm the conduct must be flagrant if it is to justify a conviction flagrant is a strong word and the use of that word points to a standard of conduct which would be alarming or seriously disturbing to any reasonable person in the particular circumstances we therefore conclude that the definition of the crime found in the principal authorities does meet the requirements of the convention in her majestys advocate v harris hcjac the appeal court citing smith emphasised that it was now clear that the crime of breach of the peace involved two elements conduct severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people and which threatened serious disturbance to the community the maximum sentence for a breach of the peace depends upon the court in which the offence is tried when prosecuted in summary proceedings in the sheriff court the maximum sentence is a fine of up to five thousand pounds sterling or imprisonment of one year breach of bail conditions pursuant to section b of the criminal procedure scotland act the act it is an offence to fail without reasonable excuse to comply with any condition imposed on bail section provides that a person guilty of an offence under section is liable to a fine or to imprisonment for up to twelve months contempt of court in hm advocate v airs jc contempt of court was described asconduct which challenges or affronts the authority of the court or the supremacy of the law itself every court in scotland has the inherent power to punish persons who are in contempt of it where contempt occurs in the court itself it may be dealt with immediately by the judge without a prior formal charge pursuant to section of the contempt of court act contempt of court in summary proceedings before a sheriff is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to three months b criminal proceedings in scotland the decision to prosecute in scotland the decision whether to prosecute an individual is taken by the crown office the crown office is wholly independent of the police and is under the responsibility of the scottish law officers the lord advocate and the solicitor general there are two forms of criminal procedure in scotland the most serious crimes are tried under solemn procedure on indictment determinations of fact in such cases are made by a jury less serious crimes are tried under summary procedure by a judge sitting without a jury the determination of the sentence in summary proceedings in summary proceedings the sheriff determines the sentence to be imposed on a person found guilty he is required to take into account a number of considerations including the offenders personal circumstances his criminal record or lack thereof the circumstances of the offence the age of the offender if under the absence of any previous custodial sentence any guidance issued by the high court any plea of guilty and any time spent in custody awaiting trial the court may decide that it is sufficient to admonish a person found guilty typically this may be done where the case concerns a first offence or is minor or there are other extenuating circumstances the procedure for appeal in summary proceedings section of the act provides for the possibility of lodging an appeal against conviction in summary proceedings section stipulates that leave is required pursuant to section any appeal against conviction must be by way of case stated the presiding judge at the trial must prepare a draft stated case and provide a copy to the appellant the stated case sets out the matters competent for review by the high court the facts proved in the case any points of law decided and the reasons for the decision parties to the proceedings may propose adjustments to the stated case if adjustments are proposed the judge must arrange a date for a hearing for the purpose of considering proposed adjustments once the case stated has been finalised a copy is sent to the appellant who must lodge it with the clerk of justiciary within one week of receipt if he fails to do so the appeal will be deemed abandoned under sections and of the act the decision whether to grant leave to appeal against conviction or sentence is made by a judge of the high court who if he considers that there are arguable grounds of appeal must grant leave to appeal and make such comments in writing as he considers appropriate in any other case the judge must refuse leave to appeal and give reasons in writing for the refusal c prison rules and directions the prison rules are contained in secondary legislation at the relevant time the rules were set out in the prisons and young offenders institutions scotland rules the prison rules from november the relevant rules were the prisons and young offenders institutions scotland rules the prison rules there is no material difference between the two sets of rules in so far as they applied to the applicant the references below are to the rules rules on segregation rule of the prison rules provided that a prisoner could be removed from association with other prisoners for the purpose of maintaining good order or discipline protecting the interests of any prisoner and ensuring the safety of others pursuant to rule a segregation order had to specify the nature of the removal from association and the reasons for making the order segregation was limited to a maximum of hours unless an extension had been authorised specifically by the scottish ministers for a further month at a time see rule and a prisoner was entitled to receive the reasons for his segregation and to make representations to the scottish ministers in respect of any application to extend segregation beyond hours rule provided that the prison governor was obliged to cancel a segregation order if he was advised by a medical officer that it was appropriate to do so on health or welfare grounds pursuant to rule where a prisoner was removed from association a medical officer was required to visit the prisoner as soon as practicable and thereafter as often as is necessary but at least once in every seven days similar provisions appear in rule of the prison rules rules on medical care part of the prison rules addressed health and welfare issues rule provided that the scottish ministers were required to make arrangements for the provision at every prison of appropriate medical services and facilities for the maintenance of good health the prevention of illness the care of prisoners suffering from illness or the aftercare of such prisoners rule provided that a medical officer had to attend prisoners who complained of illness at such times and with such frequency as the medical officer judged necessary in the circumstances the governor was obliged without delay to bring to the attention of a medical officer any prisoner whose physical or mental condition appeared to require attention rule rule made provision for a medical officer to make arrangements for consultation of specialists similar provisions can be found in part of the prison rules the prison rules are supplemented in this respect by the health board provision of healthcare in prisons scotland directions rules on general daily life further general obligations are set out in the prison rules these include the provision of reasonable assistance and facilities to develop relationships with family and friends facilitation of the practice of a prisoners religion or belief within the prison enabling visits to the prisoners provision of purposeful activities including work education counselling and vocational training daily opportunity to exercise and spend time in the open air and provision of reasonable facilities and opportunities to participate in recreational activities outwith normal working hours iii comparative law materials the court requested the parties to provide comparative information concerning the approach of other member states of the council of europe to nudity in public the government submitted information on the law and practice in nineteen of the fortysix other member states it appears from the data provided that of the nineteen states surveyed only the netherlands expressly criminalises public nudity it is punishable by the imposition of an administrative fine other states andorra belgium france germany and switzerland appear to penalise exhibitionism but the term is rarely defined it seems that sanctions vary but the data provided in this respect are incomplete according to the data a number of states have some form of public decency public order or public peace legislation that might extend to prohibiting public nudity belgium croatia the czech republic denmark estonia germany greece italy lithuania the netherlands san marino poland romania russia slovenia sweden and switzerland while sentencing information has not been provided for some of the states denmark estonia and russia it appears that sentencing powers generally vary from the imposition of fines only the czech republic germany slovenia sweden and switzerland to the possibility of imprisonment belgium croatia greece italy lithuania the netherlands poland romania and san marino the lawi the applicants repeated arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment the applicant complained about his repeated arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment for being naked in public in his first letter he invoked articles and of the convention as well as articles and of protocol no a compliance with article the parties submissionsa the government the government alleged that in respect of this complaint the applicant had failed to comply with article which provides the court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted according to the generally recognised rules of international law and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken first the government argued that each arrest and conviction was a separate incident which could not be viewed as a continuing situation they emphasised that there was no policy on the part of the police or the prosecuting authorities as regards public nudity and their response to the applicants repetition of discrete instances of criminal conduct did not make that conduct continuing they noted that in his first letter the applicant had complained about his june arrest and subsequent conviction only although he had later referred to his july arrest and subsequent conviction the government were of the view that he had not specifically complained about that arrest and conviction they therefore contended that the complaint had been lodged outside the sixmonth timelimit stipulated in article of the convention second the government argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies while he had initiated an appeal by stated case he had abandoned it on the unsupported allegation that the stated case was biased according to the government this was not a credible or acceptable basis to decline to bring his conviction under review by the competent domestic courtb the applicant the applicant reiterated that he had been repeatedly prosecuted and punished for public nudity and did not accept that his complaints had been lodged out of time relying on mc feeley and others v the united kingdom no commission decision of may decisions and reports dr p he maintained that his case concerned a permanent state of affairs which was still continuing and that the question of the sixmonth rule could only arise after the state of affairs had ceased he further maintained that he had exhausted all domestic remedies available to him he had appealed his august conviction by case stated invoking arguments under the convention and was refused leave to appeal at the first and second sifts in december there was no further avenue of appeal under scots law in these circumstances there was no prospect of obtaining damages the courts assessmenta the sixmonth rule the object of the sixmonth timelimit under article is to promote legal certainty by ensuring that cases raising issues under the convention are dealt with in a reasonable time and that past decisions are not continually open to challenge as a rule the sixmonth period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies however it has been said that the sixmonth timelimit does not apply as such to continuing situations because if there is a situation of ongoing breach the timelimit in effect starts afresh each day and it is only once the situation ceases that the final period of six months will run to its end chiragov and others v armenia gc dec no december in the present case each arrest with the ensuing prosecution conviction and sentence of imprisonment was a discrete incident which followed directly upon the applicants appearance naked in public on different occasions as the government pointed out and as is evident from the facts as outlined the applicant has enjoyed periods of liberty between his periods of detention even if sometimes only for a few minutes accordingly while the cycle of release and rearrest can be said to constitute a pattern it can not be viewed as a continuing situation within the meaning of the courts caselaw compare and contrast mc feeley and others cited above the sixmonth period therefore began to run in respect of each conviction from the date of the final domestic decision in the case in his first letter to the court dated july the applicant complained about his arrest in june his subsequent conviction and the appeal proceedings his appeal in respect of that conviction was abandoned on october had his complaint been directed solely at that conviction it would have been lodged outside the sixmonth timeperiod allowed by article however in his subsequent application form dated december he complained that his repeated conviction and imprisonment for the offence of breach of the peace owing to his refusal to wear clothes in public amounted to a violation of the convention he set out details of his arrest on july and conviction on august with reference to his pending appeal the court is therefore satisfied that he also complained about his arrest and conviction in the wider context of a pattern of prosecutions and convictions for being naked in public leave to appeal in respect of the july conviction was refused on december the applicant having first notified the court of this complaint on december he has therefore complied with the sixmonth timelimit in this respectb nonexhaustion of domestic remedies it is primordial that the machinery of protection established by the convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights this court is concerned with the supervision of the implementation by contracting states of their obligations under the convention it can not and must not usurp the role of contracting states whose responsibility it is to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined therein are respected and protected on a domestic level the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is therefore an indispensable part of the functioning of this system of protection states are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system and those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the court as concerns complaints against a state are thus obliged to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system see amongst many authorities akdivar and others v turkey september reports of judgments and decisions iv and blatchford v the united kingdom dec no june as stipulated in its akdivar judgment cited above normal recourse should be had by an applicant to remedies which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged the existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness as the court also held in akdivar cited above in the area of the exhaustion of domestic remedies there is a distribution of the burden of proof it is incumbent on the government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time that is to say that it was accessible was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicants complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success however once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement finally the application of the rule must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the contracting parties have agreed to set up and that it must therefore be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism see akdivar cited above it is apparent that the applicant sought to appeal his conviction by way of case stated see paragraphs above in his appeal he invoked articles and of the convention permission to appeal was refused on the second sift on december see paragraph above the applicant has accordingly exhausted available domestic remedies in respect of his complaintc conclusion on compliance with article of the convention in conclusion the applicant has satisfied the requirements of article of the convention in respect of his complaint about his arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment as one incident in a pattern of arrests prosecutions and convictions over a number of years which was continuing at the time that he lodged his application the relevance of this broader context will be discussed further in the examination of the admissibility and merits of his individual complaints below b the alleged violations of articles and of the convention as noted above in his first letter the applicant invoked articles guaranteeing the right to liberty and security and prohibiting punishment without law in respect of his repeated arrest prosecution conviction and sentence without providing further details of the precise nature of the complaints he did not reiterate these complaints in the application form subsequently lodged by his solicitors although the court sought written observations on the complaints under these articles from the parties the applicant did not subsequently make any relevant written submissions the applicant who was legally represented chose not to pursue the complaints either in his application form or in his written submissions in the circumstances the court sees no reason to examine the complaints c the alleged violation of article of the convention article of the convention provides everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary scope of the complaint as noted above while citing two particular instances of arrest and conviction the applicant clearly complained about his repeated arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment for the offence of breach of the peace owing to his refusal to wear clothes in public although the court has concluded that this did not amount to a continuing situation for the purposes of the sixmonth rule in article of the convention it did accept that the incidents formed part of a pattern of arrests prosecutions convictions and sentences of imprisonment for being naked in public see paragraph above it would be artificial to ignore this wider pattern when considering the compliance of the measures with the applicants article rights since it is precisely their repeated nature which has led to the applicants detention for a number of years the court will therefore examine the compatibility of the applicants arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment with article of the convention in the light of the pattern of prior and subsequent such incidents applicability of article and the admissibility of the complaint the applicant argued that public nudity was a clear form of expression within the meaning of article of the convention the term expression had been widely construed by the court to cover various different forms of expression including expression in words in pictures by video and through conduct intended to convey an idea or information in his case the decision not to wear clothes was a direct expression of his principled views on the human body his complaint therefore fell within the scope of article of the convention the government responded that there had been no restriction placed on the applicant in this regard and that he was free to advocate his views they did not accept that wearing no clothes constituted freedom of expression or that the requirement to wear clothes in certain contexts prevented freedom of expression the protection of article extends not only to the substance of the ideas and information expressed but also to the form in which they are conveyed jersild v denmark september series a no the court accepts that the right to freedom of expression may include the right for a person to express his ideas through his mode of dress or his conduct see respectively stevens v the united kingdom no commission decision of march dr p and kara v the united kingdom no commission decision of october unreported and smith and grady v the united kingdom dec nos and february in donaldson v the united kingdom dec no january it found that the applicants decision to wear an easter lily a symbol to commemorate the irish republican combatants who died during or were executed after the easter rising in ireland had to be regarded as a way of expressing his political views see also vajnai v hungary no echr in steel and others v the united kingdom september reports vii the court held that protests which took the form of physically impeding the activities of which the applicants disapproved constituted expressions of opinion within the meaning of article see also hashman and harrup v the united kingdom gc no echr viii in the present case the applicant has chosen to be naked in public in order to give expression to his opinion as to the inoffensive nature of the human body see paragraphs and above the court is therefore satisfied that the applicants public nudity can be seen as a form of expression which falls within the ambit of article of the convention and that his arrest prosecution conviction and detention constituted repressive measures taken in reaction to that form of expression of his opinions by the applicant there has therefore been an interference with his exercise of his right to freedom of expression in view of the submissions of the parties the court considers that the complaint raises complex and serious issues under article of the convention which can not be dismissed as manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article of the convention no other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established and it must therefore be declared admissible merits of the complaint an interference with the right to freedom of expression can only be justified under article if it is prescribed by law pursues one of more of the legitimate aims to which article refers and is necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve any such aima prescribed by lawi the parties submissions the applicant argued his criminal prosecution for public nudity was not prescribed by law he did not expand upon this submission the government contended that the interference was prescribed by law they noted that the various measures were taken on the basis of domestic law it was not the role of this court to consider whether the domestic law had been correctly applied to the applicant and whether he had been correctly convictedii the courts assessment the applicant failed in the context of his written submissions under article to explain the nature of his challenge to the legality of the measures taken against him having regard to the courts finding in lucas v the united kingdom dec no march that the definition of the offence of breach of the peace as stipulated in smith v donnelly see paragraph above was sufficiently precise to provide reasonable foreseeability of the actions which might fall within the remit of the offence the court is satisfied that the interference in the present case both had a sufficient legal basis in domestic law and was prescribed by law in the wider sense of having the quality required of law in a democratic societyb in pursuit of a legitimate aimi the parties submissions the applicant contended that his arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment were not in pursuit of any of the stated aims listed in article he did not elaborate on this submission the government argued that the measures pursued the aim of preventing disorder and crime by preventing breaches of the peace in publicii the courts assessment having regard to all the circumstances surrounding the actions of the applicant and the police the court accepts that the measures aimed to prevent disorder and crime however the parties did not make detailed submissions identifying more clearly the precise nature of the disorder and crime which the measures were taken to prevent it is clear that in a straightforward sense the measures were designed to prevent the applicants committing breach of the peace through causing offence to and alarming other members of the public by confronting them with his naked state in public however the applicants arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment can be seen to have pursued the broader aim of seeking to ensure respect for the law in general and thereby preventing the crime and disorder which would potentially ensue were the applicant permitted to continually and persistently flout the law with impunity because of his own personal albeit sincerely held opinion on nudityc necessary in a democratic societyi the parties submissionsα the applicant the applicant argued that there was no pressing social need to justify the restrictions on public nudity or that if there was such restrictions were not proportionate to that need in the applicants view the responses of other council of europe states to public nudity see paragraphs above reinforced his submission as to the disproportionality of his repeated arrest and imprisonment in the absence of any suggestion that he intended to cause harassment or disturbance to the public a significant majority of states either did not treat public nudity as a criminal offence or treated it as a minor misdemeanour susceptible to a fine or a short period of imprisonment this was to be contrasted with his situation where he had served almost seven years in prison for public nudity following a pattern of arrest prosecution conviction imprisonment release and immediate rearrest he therefore invited the court to find a violation of article of the conventionβ the government the government argued that defining the scope of the crime of breach of the peace was peculiarly sensitive to the mores of individual states as regards the responses of other states to public nudity they emphasised that the period which the applicant had spent in prison was not the result of a oneoff offence attracting a response by the authorities which was out of step with other council of europe states oneoff offences of the nature at issue in the present case also attracted minor responses from the prosecuting authorities in the united kingdom the applicants imprisonment on the other hand arose from his repeat offending in an area of criminal policy where there was a divergence of views among the council of europe member states such as in the present case a particularly wide margin of appreciation applied the government maintained that any interference was justified and proportionate it was confined to preventing certain conduct by reason of its adverse impact or potentially adverse impact on others and on the public order in a public context they further emphasised that any person who exercised freedom of expression undertook duties and responsibilities that included the obligation to avoid expressions which were offensive to others and which did not contribute to any form of public debate capable of furthering progress in human affairs the government were of the view that the applicant had failed to act consistently with this principle finally they pointed out that the applicant was not tried for every offence alleged that not every trial resulted in a conviction and that not every conviction resulted in a term of imprisonment as far as the fortytwo offences for which he was arrested in scotland in the nineyear period between july and july were concerned the crown decided not to initiate proceedings in respect of twelve the applicant was acquitted in respect of three offences on a finding of not guilty on the acceptance of a no case to answer submission and on the acceptance of a not guilty plea respectively in respect of the remaining twentyseven offences of which he was convicted the applicant was admonished on three occasions a term of imprisonment of three months had only been imposed after the seventh occurrence of a breach of the peace it was also relevant that the sheriff had specifically raised the possibility of a deferred sentence with the applicant following his conviction in july if he agreed to wear clothes but the applicant had refused to agree see paragraph aboveii the courts assessmentα general principles freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society see handyside v the united kingdom december series a no donaldson cited above animal defenders international v the united kingdom gc no echr extracts this freedom is subject to exceptions pursuant to article which must be construed strictly the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article see mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no july and animal defenders international cited above the breadth of the margin of appreciation to be afforded depends on a number of factors the national authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in matters of morals since there is no uniform european conception of morals accordingly state authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of the requirements of morals as well as on the necessity of measures intended to meet them see handyside cited above and open door and dublin well woman v ireland october series a no a a narrow margin of appreciation applies in respect of debates on questions of public interest and the freedom of expression enjoyed by the press when exercising its vital role as a public watchdog animal defenders international cited above while they do not benefit from the special protection afforded to the press even small and informal campaign groups must be able to carry on their activities effectively there exists a strong public interest in enabling such groups and individuals outside the mainstream to contribute to the public debate by disseminating information and ideas on matters of general public interest such as health and the environment steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii and mutatis mutandis bowman v the united kingdom february reports i it must also be borne in mind that by virtue of the express terms of paragraph of article whoever exercises his freedom of expression undertakes duties and responsibilities the scope of which depends on his situation and the technical means he uses these duties and responsibilities must be taken into account in the courts assessment of the necessity of the measure see handyside cited above and hachette filipacchi associés v france no june the court has previously found that in the context of religious opinions and beliefs such duties and responsibilities may include an obligation to avoid as far as possible expressions that are gratuitously offensive to others and thus an infringement of their rights and which therefore do not contribute to any form of public debate capable of furthering progress in human affairs this being so it said it may be considered necessary in certain democratic societies to sanction or even prevent improper attacks on objects of religious veneration provided always that the penalty imposed be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued see otto preminger institut v austria september series a no a however although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of people from minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position see chassagnou and others v france gc nos and echr iii leyla şahin gc cited above and bayatyan v armenia gc no july pluralism and democracy must be based on dialogue and a spirit of compromise necessarily entailing various concessions on the part of individuals or groups of individuals which are justified in order to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society see leyla şahin gc cited above and tănase v moldova gc no echr respect by the state of the views of a minority by tolerating conduct which is not per se incompatible with the values of a democratic society or wholly outside the norms of conduct of such a society far from creating unjust inequalities or discrimination ensures cohesive and stable pluralism and promotes harmony and tolerance in society see mutatis mutandis bayatyan cited above finally in assessing the proportionality of a restriction on freedom of expression the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are factors to be taken into account see ceylan v turkey gc no echr iv tammer v estonia no echr i and skałka v poland no may the court will in light of all of the above considerations assess whether the reasons relied on by the competent national authorities notably the courts to justify the measures were both relevant and sufficient and whether the resultant interference was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued in this respect the court reiterates that it is not its task to take the place of the national authorities but it must review in the light of the case as a whole those authorities decisions taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation animal defenders international cited above in conducting its review the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see donaldson cited above β application of the general principles to the facts of the case the present case concerns the applicants arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment for the offence of breach of the peace on account of his appearing naked in public in the context of a pattern of previous such measures the court is prepared to accept that the extent to which and the circumstances in which public nudity is acceptable in a modern society is a matter of public interest the fact that the applicants views on public nudity are shared by very few people is not of itself conclusive of the issue now before the court see mutatis mutandis young james and webster v the united kingdom august series a no as an individual intent on achieving greater acceptance of public nudity the applicant is entitled to seek to initiate such a debate and there is a public interest in allowing him to do so however the issue of public nudity also raises moral and publicorder considerations the comparative data supplied by the government show that even in the small number of states surveyed the responses of the law and of the authorities to public nudity are far from uniform in these circumstances the applicable margin of appreciation in reacting to instances of public nudity as opposed to regulating mere statements or arguments on the subject is a wide one turning to examine the approach to manifestations of public nudity in scotland the police and the crown office had discretion in deciding how to respond to such incidents as demonstrated by the applicants own case the measures taken against him were not the result of any blanket prohibition each incident was considered on its facts and in light of the applicants own history of offending following his early arrests he was generally released with no further action being pursued see paragraphs to above on the occasions when he was prosecuted the courts demonstrated a similarly individualised approach the applicant was only convicted after it had established at trial on the basis of evidence as to his conduct in a particularly public place that the offence of breach of the peace had been made out namely that he had caused alarm to other people and serious disturbance to the community see paragraph above on one occasion the sheriff found on the prosecution evidence that there was no case to answer and three times the applicant was found not guilty either following acceptance of a not guilty plea or after a trial of the facts see paragraphs and above following the applicants trial at which he also appeared naked see paragraph above the sheriff was satisfied that the applicants appearance naked on a public road outside hmp perth was sufficiently severe to cause alarm to ordinary people and serious disturbance to the community see paragraph above although the applicant could have avoided arrest outside hmp perth by complying with the police officers request that he put on clothes he refused to do so see paragraph above the sheriff commented that had the applicant appeared naked in a more remote place or in a place where fewer people would be congregated rather than in or near one of the main streets of a busy town he might have reached a different conclusion see paragraph above as to the severity of the sanctions it is noteworthy that after his early convictions the applicant was either admonished see paragraph above or received short sentences of imprisonment of between two weeks and three months see for example paragraphs and above it was only after a number of convictions for public nudity that the courts began to impose more substantial custodial sentences on the applicant even then efforts were made to reach a less severe penalty when sentencing the applicant for breach of the peace in the sheriff explored the possibility of a noncustodial sentence if the applicant would agree to wear clothes and only imposed a oneyear sentence when the applicant refused to accept a condition of remaining clothed see paragraph above by the time of his conviction and sentence of days together with a requirement to serve in addition days outstanding for a previous sentence see paragraph above he had been arrested over thirty times for public nudity and convicted almost twenty times in assessing the proportionality of the penalty imposed the court is therefore not concerned with the respondent states response to an individual incident of public nudity but with its response to the applicants persistent public nudity and his wilful and contumacious refusal to obey the law over a number of years see for example the sheriffs comments as to sentence in respect of the june conviction at paragraphs above it is true that by the time that the sentence was imposed the applicant had already served a cumulative total of five years and three months in detention since may on remand pending fifteen criminal prosecutions and postconviction pursuant to twelve sentences of imprisonment with only four days spent at liberty during that period at the point at which he subsequently left scotland on october he had spent almost six and a half consecutive years in prison with less than a dozen days at liberty throughout the entire period the cumulative period of imprisonment in scotland since for the repeated instances of his refusal to dress in public stands at over seven years while the penalty imposed for each individual offence taken on its own is not such as to raise an issue under article in terms of lack of proportionality the cumulative impact on the applicant of the measures taken by the respondent state which was undeniably severe is otherwise however the applicants own responsibility for the convictions and the sentences imposed can not be ignored in exercising his right to freedom of expression he was in principle under a general duty to respect the countrys laws and to pursue his desire to bring about legislative or societal change in accordance with them see mutatis mutandis tănase cited above many other avenues for the expression of his opinion on nudity or for initiating a public debate on the subject were open to the applicant he was also under a duty particularly in light of the fact that he was asking for tolerance in respect of his own conduct to demonstrate tolerance of and sensibility to the views of other members of the public however the applicant appears to reject any suggestion that acceptance of public nudity may vary depending on the nature of the location and the presence of other members of the public without any demonstration of sensibility to the views of others and the behaviour that they might consider offensive he insists upon his right to appear naked at all times and in all places including in the courts in the communal areas of prisons and on aeroplanes see for example paragraphs and above the applicants case is troubling since his intransigence has led to his spending a substantial period of time in prison for what is in itself usually a relatively trivial offence see paragraph above however the applicants imprisonment is the consequence of his repeated violation of the criminal law in full knowledge of the consequences through conduct which he knew full well not only goes against the standards of accepted public behaviour in any modern democratic society but also is liable to be alarming and morally and otherwise offensive to other unwarned members of the public going about their ordinary business having regard to the considerations set out above and to the wide margin of appreciation the court finds that the reasons for the measures adopted by the police the prosecuting authorities and the courts and in particular those adopted in respect of his arrest in were relevant and sufficient and that the measures met a pressing social need in response to repeated antisocial conduct by the applicant it can not be said that the repressive measures taken in reaction to the particular repeated form of expression chosen by the applicant to communicate his opinion on nudity were even if considered cumulatively disproportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued namely the prevention of disorder and crime in particular article does not go so far as to enable individuals even those sincerely convinced of the virtue of their own beliefs to repeatedly impose their antisocial conduct on other unwilling members of society and then to claim a disproportionate interference with the exercise of their freedom of expression when the state in the performance of its duty to protect the public from public nuisances enforces the law in respect of such deliberately repetitive antisocial conduct even though cumulatively the penalties imposed on the applicant undoubtedly did entail serious consequences for him the court can not find in the circumstances of his case having regard in particular to his own responsibility for his plight that the public authorities in scotland unjustifiably interfered with his exercise of freedom of expression accordingly no violation of article of the convention has been established d the alleged violation of article of the convention article of the convention provides everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life his home and his correspondence there shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others the parties submissions the applicant contended that restrictions pertaining to a persons mode of personal presentation were a function of personal identity and an exercise of personal autonomy as such any restrictions or the imposition of sanctions to compel a particular mode of personal presentation constituted an interference with the right to respect for private life he argued that his criminal prosecution for public nudity was not in accordance with the law and that his arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment were not in pursuit of any of the stated aims listed in article he did not elaborate on these submissions relying on his submissions in respect of article he invited the court to find a violation of article of the convention the government argued that the rights guaranteed by article did not extend to matters concerning personal appearance nor did they extend to acts done publicly or in a sense done for a public purpose they emphasised that article did not cover every opportunity to establish and develop relationships citing friend and others v the united kingdom dec no november they further contended that article did not have the effect of protecting conduct which would otherwise be considered criminal accordingly they concluded that the criminal law of breach of the peace did not impinge on the sphere private to the applicant in the event that article was found to be applicable the government contended that the interference was in accordance with the law and pursued the aims of prevention of breach of the peace or of crime and disorder and the protection of the applicant they maintained that the measures taken against the applicant were both necessary and proportionate and referred again to the wide margin of appreciation applicable in the field of morals the courts assessment the concept of private life is broad in scope and not susceptible of exhaustive definition in general terms it secures to the individual a sphere within which he can freely pursue the development and fulfilment of his personality see sidabras and džiautas v lithuania nos and echr viii and shtukaturov v russia no echr in sas v france gc no july the grand chamber stated that personal choices as to an individuals desired appearance whether in public or in private places relate to the expression of his personality and thus fall within the notion of private life the notion of private life also protects a right to identity and to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world there is therefore a zone of interaction of a person with others even in a public context which may fall within the scope of private life see pg and jh v the united kingdom no echr ix peck v the united kingdom no echr i perry v the united kingdom no echr ix extracts and gillan and quinton v the united kingdom no echr extracts on the other hand not every activity that a person might seek to engage in with other human beings in order to establish and develop relationships will be protected by article it will not for example protect interpersonal relations of such broad and indeterminate scope that there can be no conceivable direct link between the action or inaction of a state and a persons private life see friend and others cited above however the fact that behaviour is prohibited by the criminal law is not sufficient to bring it outside the scope of private life see adt v the united kingdom no echr ix and pay v the united kingdom dec no september finally the notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of the guarantee afforded by article see pretty v the united kingdom no echr iii and gillan and quinton cited above the applicant by deliberately and consistently appearing naked in very public places such as urban centres courtrooms and the communal parts of prisons was intent on making a public statement of his belief in the inoffensive nature of the human body the court has found that his conduct amounted to a form of expression protected by article see paragraph it has previously indicated that a distinction must be drawn between carrying out an activity for personal fulfilment and carrying out the same activity for a public purpose where one can not be said to be acting for personal fulfilment alone see friend and others cited above furthermore as concerns in particular an individuals personal choices as to his desired appearance in public as referred to in sas cited above on analogy with the applicability of article of the convention to religious beliefs text of article cited below at paragraph article can not be taken to protect every conceivable personal choice in that domain there must presumably be a de minimis level of seriousness as to the choice of desired appearance in question see mutatis mutandis in relation to article bayatyan cited above and eweida and others v the united kingdom no echr extracts whether the requisite level of seriousness has been reached in relation to the applicants choice to appear fully naked on all occasions in all public places without distinction may be doubted having regard to the absence of support for such a choice in any known democratic society in the world in any event however even if article were to be taken to be applicable to the circumstances of the present case the court is satisfied that those circumstances are not such as to disclose a violation of that provision on the part of the public authorities in scotland in sum any interference with the applicants right to respect for his private life was justified under article for essentially the same reasons given by the court in the context of its analysis of the applicants complaint under article of the convention see paragraphs above e the alleged violation of article of the convention article of the convention provides everyone has the right to freedom of thought conscience and religion this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom either alone or in community with others and in public or private to manifest his religion or belief in worship teaching practice and observance freedom to manifest ones religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety for the protection of public order health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others the applicant made no submissions on the applicability of article of the convention the government noted that the applicant had not elaborated on his claim under article of the convention and contended in particular that he had not presented his views as a belief which attracted article protection they challenged whether his views satisfied the requirements of cogency and seriousness even if there was a belief there was no manifestation attracting the protection of article the applicant failed to make submissions as to the applicability of article to the case on the basis of the material before it the court finds that he has not shown that his belief met the necessary requirements of cogency seriousness cohesion and importance to fall within the scope of article of the convention see bayatyan cited above and eweida and others cited above this complaint must accordingly be declared inadmissible as incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the convention pursuant to article a and f other complaints the applicant also complained under article c that he was not permitted to attend an adjustments hearing in respect of his stated case in october he further invoked articles and and articles and of protocol no on may he invoked for the first time article arguing that the sentences imposed on him were individually and cumulatively grossly disproportionate having regard to all the material in its possession and in so far as these complaints fall within the courts competence it finds that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the convention or its protocols it follows that this part of the application must be rejected as manifestly illfounded pursuant to article a and of the convention ii treatment in detention the applicant complained of a violation of articles and as a result of his treatment while in detention referring to i the failure to provide dental and optical treatment ii the failure to provide medical treatment regarding a lump on his testicle iii his segregation from other prisoners and the failure to allow him to exercise and iv the denial of visits from family and friends a compliance with article of the convention the parties submissionsa the government the government contested the admissibility of the applicants complaint concerning his treatment in detention they contended that he had on april impermissibly extended his original complaint to include matters relating to his detention they further argued that there was no evidence of any continuing conduct such as to elide the application of the sixmonth timelimit they argued that there was no policy on the part of the prison authorities as regards the conditions of the applicants detention whether in relation to segregation exercise or access to medical treatment this was borne out by the applicants different experiences in different prisons and even in the same prison over time the government also submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies the prison rules embodied and promoted respect for some of the very convention rights which the applicant claimed had been breached there was a clear and accessible internal procedure for making complaints if he remained dissatisfied he could have sought judicial review however at no point did the applicant make a claim for damages in respect of the alleged convention violations either by way of judicial review proceedings or through an ordinary action in the sheriff court there had been successful judicial review actions brought by prisoners about the features of the very regime of segregation to which the applicant was subjected and about conditions of detention judicial review was a flexible and quick procedure in which the applicant could have advanced all claims for a breach of his convention rights and sought damages they considered the applicants reasons for not pursuing a judicial review claim see paragraphs below not to be credible and argued that he had not done all that could reasonably be expected of him to exhaust domestic remedies the applicant had not been held in total isolation and had enjoyed access to the telephone and to postal services it was not sufficient that he had made several telephone calls he had not indicated that he had sought other sources of assistance including contacting the citizens advice bureaux or the faculty of advocates free representation unit nor had he suggested that he had made an application for advice and assistance the form of legal assistance available to assist in identifying whether there were grounds for legal action or for legal aid in any event they considered that lack of financial means did not absolve an applicant from making some attempt to take legal proceedingsb the applicant the applicant explained that he had pursued his complaints within the sps internal complaints procedure on numerous occasions he had also applied to the ombudsman more than once his complaints were rejected he had sought legal representation to challenge his detention in judicial review proceedings but was unable to do so he had contacted solicitors on a list provided to him by the prison authorities but was unsuccessful pursuant to rules on legal advice and assistance to which the government referred the maximum fee for solicitors was gbp this was often insufficient to cover the basis expenses of a prison visit let alone remuneration for the legal advice provided as for the possibility of commencing judicial review proceedings in person the applicant emphasised that this would have required knowledge of a specialised area of scots administrative law and procedure as well as an ability to sift and analyse documents and evidence the applicant as a serving prisoner had limited or no access to the kind of legal administrative or technical resources necessary for this task nor did he have the legal expertise or knowledge required he could not he argued be expected to know all the finer points of judicial proceedings and the absence of legal assistance meant that he was not in a position to pursue a remedy which might have been theoretically open to him the courts assessmenta sixmonth rule by letter dated february the applicant first complained to this court about his treatment while in prison relevant prior complaints had been rejected by the domestic authorities less than six months before the date on which he first complained about his conditions of detention the applicant has therefore lodged his complaint within the six months provided for in article of the conventionb nonexhaustion the applicant did not dispute that judicial review proceedings were in principle effective and would have offered reasonable prospects of success in respect of his complaints concerning his treatment in detention the government have therefore satisfied the burden of proof of showing the availability of a remedy which was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time see paragraph above the applicant must accordingly establish that judicial review proceedings were inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of his case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement to exhaust see paragraph above the government did not contest the applicants submission that he sought assistance from the law society of scotland and subsequently contacted a number of solicitors all of whom declined to act for him it is therefore clear that the applicant took some steps to pursue domestic remedies which were available however it is noteworthy that on september only two months after the applicant had lodged his case with this court while in prison by the submission of a letter of introduction which he had himself prepared bindmans solicitors contacted the court to confirm that they had been recently instructed by the applicant to represent him the applicant has not explained how he was successful in obtaining representation for his case before this court having been unsuccessful in obtaining scottish legal assistance for judicial review proceedings in the court of session nor has he explained why bindmans were unable to arrange for the commencement of judicial review proceedings on his behalf at that time indeed by february when he first informed the court of his complaints about his treatment in detention he had already enjoyed legal representation from bindmans for over four months in the circumstances the court concludes that the applicant has not discharged the burden upon him to demonstrate that the remedy offered by judicial review was ineffective or that there were special circumstances which exempted him from pursuing it he has accordingly failed to exhaust domestic remedies in respect of his complaint about his treatment in detention it must therefore be rejected pursuant to article and for these reasons the court unanimously declares the complaints under articles and concerning the applicants arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on october pursuant to rule and of the rules of court fatoş aracıineta

15,in and respectively and live in belgrade the applicants were represented by mr m stojković a lawyer practising in novi beograd the government were represented by their agent mrs z jadrijević mladar the facts of the case may be summarised as follows the circumstances of the case background information the applicants are journalists and civilsector activists who often criticised the government and the authorities in early they participated in the protests relating to the demolition of certain houses and installations objekti in belgrade the lack of transparency of a largescale construction project in belgrade and the changes in the management of radio television vojvodina on may the website of the rightwing movement published an article titled dont let serbia drown ne davimo srbiju

there is the first applicant the executive director of the slavko ćuruvija foundation whose main donors are the rockefeller brothers fund the balkan trust for democracy a project of the german marshall fund of the united states ned the national endowment for democracy the embassy of the kingdom of denmark and the embassy of australia in belgrade behind a welltuned system of media and ngos political parties and individuals there is an intention of western centres of power to influence the formation of the new government of serbia through pressure by imposing topics and by a range of other techniques as well as to create in perspective conditions for further destabilisation of the state and to turn serbs against serbs while the process of establishing kosovo statehood is being finalised further destabilisation of the state encouraged and the separatist tendencies are growing the focus of the public is being directed towards the demolition of a few houses and installations the situation in which entire western agencies manipulate peoples dissatisfaction caused by injustice done confirms the influence of the foreignfinanced nongovernmental sector on political events in serbia that is why the only and urgent measure of supressing such subversive actions is the adoption of an ngo act which would treat as foreign agents ngos financed from abroad and interfering with internal political issues and which would provide for their criminal prosecution the same text with a different title was published the next day on another website whose editorinchief is im on june the daily media platform informer both the printed and online versions published an article titled the assassination of the prime minister begins the eu and the usa are paying extremists to create chaos in serbia the article stated that the eu and us ambassadors in serbia had conceived a plan for the radicalisation of the dont let belgrade drown protests through which they would try to overthrow the prime minister before he managed to form the new government they were coordinating and organising the financing of the protests which were supposed to develop into violent demonstrations and a colour revolution antiregime protests aimed at overthrowing governments the ultimate aim was the violent occupation of institutions even the incitement of conflict with the police and the ruling party supporters which would lead to an extraordinary political state the atmosphere at protests should be combative in character as the protests up to that point had not been a threat the article also stated that the reports obtained by informer indicated that a number of persons were actively participating in this project and published photos of several of them including the applicants the online article was followed by readers comments some of them about fifteen in total referred to domestic traitors and mercenaries failed journalists the easily corrupted sold souls western pets

shitty poles on june the informers editorinchief dv was interviewed on tv pink whose editorinchief was žm he repeated the allegations in the previous articles and in doing so referred to a number of individuals including the first and third applicants in particular he said that the ambassadors had been exchanging written documentation relating to the protests with the first applicant and that the third applicant was also part of the project on june the informer both the printed and online versions published another article suggesting that there were new details of a big western conspiracy against the authorities in serbia the article mainly repeated the allegations from the article of the day before including mentioning the applicants on june a television show balkan spring in the

right to equality povreda ravnopravnosti against ss im dv and žm they submitted that in the articles and television shows in question ss im dv and žm had persecuted organisations and individuals

on their religion nationality and other personal characteristics notably having different political opinions on an unspecified date before august the high public prosecutor requested the police to investigate these allegations between and august the police interviewed the applicants ss and im in substance the applicants denied the allegations made in the articles and television shows and stated that they had harmed their honour personal and professional reputation and made them feel threatened they submitted that they had not received any direct threats but they had been commented on in a negative context or in a discriminatory and insulting manner on social media the third applicant submitted that such allegations put her in danger and could have dramatic consequences of which there had been dramatic examples in recent history the first applicant submitted that certain media had added significance to his ethnicity nacionalnoj pripadnosti which he considered had been done in order to incite ethnic intolerance and public persecution ss stated that his text was an analysis through which he had intended to warn of the working methods of the people mentioned in the article and their financing which information he had found in publicly available sources primarily on the websites of the organisations in question given that the applicants were themselves engaged in public work they should have been aware that they were susceptible to criticism im stated that his website had merely reproduced prenela the same text he considered the applicants criminal complaint a result of the political campaign that they were running against the authorities and media connected to the authorities and their misconception that the prime minister had something to do with ims website which

information between january and december the high court viši sud in belgrade delivered eight judgments in which it ruled sometimes partly in favour of different claimants and ordered that either a reply to or a rectification of information be published the judgments relied on the relevant articles of the public information and media act and were all upheld as regards the merits by the court of appeal apelacioni sud in belgrade between april and april as regards the prohibition of hate speech on may and september the high court in belgrade delivered two judgments in which it found that publishing certain information had violated the prohibition of hate speech and ordered the respondent party to publish the judgments both judgments were upheld by the court of appeal on january and december respectively in particular on may the high court ruled against informer because of an article entitled serbia needs trumps law published on february the article had the overline nadnaslov war to foreign mercenaries and subtitle the authorities in serbia must apply the laws applicable in the usa and ban the work of ngos which receive millions of euros from the west in order to provoke conflicts divisions and chaos in the country the article further suggested that the authorities of serbia should urgently propose bills as the united states of america had done which would restrict the work of branches agentura of foreign ngos on its territory whose only task was to provoke conflicts and create chaos in serbia that would stop once and for all organisations such as the sorosinspired šiptar fascist youth initiative for human rights which had received euros in the previous three years for the sole purpose of initiating social conflict in serbia the article further stated that the western ngos in serbia were foreign mercenaries working in the interest of their financers which was often against the interests of serbia which was why they were traitors the court relied on articles to and of the public information and media act and found that the text in question contained information the publishing of which was forbidden more specifically expressions such as foreign mercenary traitor sorosinspired šiptar fascist organisation initiating social conflict in serbia amounted to hate speech and in certain sections of society had incited hatred intolerance discrimination even violence and had been used to discredit the persons to whom they had referred the court considered that it was not necessary that the publishing of the information had in fact resulted in violence against a person or group of persons of certain characteristics on september the high court in belgrade issued another judgment against a respondent party whose name was blacked out the court found that publishing an article titled fascists attack on january had violated the prohibition of hate speech ordered that the judgment be published and awarded the claimant compensation of serbian dinars plus statutory interest the article in question had the overline special war begins and a subtitle stormtroopers of sorosinspired šiptar youth initiative crashed into a ruling party public discussion tribina in beška and interrupted it by swearing at those who were present on account of their serb mothers it also suggested that further similar attacks were being planned across the country the article further stated that this had been done following the orders to this effect of western embassies and that sorosinspired ngos in cooperation with western embassies nato pact the eu and also the šiptar authorities from priština were planning more attacks of this kind across the country they were ready to do all this so that they could create chaos in the country before the elections and accuse the ruling party of violence the court found that this amounted to hate speech against the youth initiative for human rights it found that the text in question was not covered by impartial journalistic reporting but that it expressed insinuations speculations assumptions and conjectures and presented them as facts and at the same time it expressed very serious accusations against the claimants and other ngos notably that they had been preparing other similar actions in order to create general chaos in serbia before the forthcoming elections a socalled special war the court found that the editorinchief had intended to depict the activists of youth initiative for human rights as enemies and a danger to the republic of serbia and its other citizens and discriminate against them for their political that is ideological beliefs which amounted to a kind of inciting hatred against them as regards compensation between june and october the high court delivered thirteen judgments in which it ruled sometimes partly in favour of various claimants and awarded them compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage for a violation of their honour and reputation or their dignity and presumption of innocence caused by untrue andor forbidden nedopuštenih information being published about them the court referred inter alia to the relevant articles of the public information and media act or public information act and article of the obligations act see paragraphs and above in eight of those cases the court also ordered the respondent party to publish the judgment in question twelve of those judgments were upheld to a large extent by the court of appeal between december and march there is no information in the case file about one of the judgments in this regard in particular on september the high court ruled in favour of a claimant and awarded him compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage caused inter alia by publishing readers comments the court found that the comments contained hate speech which was not permitted under the public information act and that the respondent party could have made a selection of comments and prevented the publishing of the forbidden ones on september the high court ruled partly in favour of a claimant awarded him compensation and ordered that the judgment be published the name of the respondent party and some parts of the article are blacked out it appears from the visible parts that the respondent party in question had published a picture of the claimant and stated that while the šiptars are threatening war blackedout name wants blood that a certain tycoon was financing and organising nonpolitical party protests which were to set belgrade on fire and that the claimant had appeared in the parliament in a yellow vest and had announced that there would be violence on the streets the court also considered that the editor of the online edition had not responded adequately in respect of the negative comments that followed the article online as regards the regulatory body for electronic media between december and may the regulatory body for electronic media delivered fifteen decisions in which it issued three notices three bans on further publishing of the particular content and nine warnings in all these decisions the media platform in question also had to remove the inappropriate content and publish a statement saopštenje the content of which was defined by the court four decisions were issued against the pink media company and one against another media company for having broadcast a programme in which the editor of informer had insulted another person as regards criminal offences between january and july the first court of first instance prvi osnovni sud in belgrade delivered ten judgments against various defendants for the criminal offence of insult two of whom were editors of two different media platforms including the editorinchief of informer in eight cases the court fined defendants and in two cases the court issued a reprimand sudska opomena on january and april the supreme court of cassation issued two judgments kzz and kzz respectively regarding the criminal offence of endangering the safety of others the court held that an important element of the said criminal offence was that there was a serious clear and unambiguous threat by an individual a defendant that he or she would attack the life or body of another person the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicants complained under article of the convention that the state had not discharged its positive obligation to protect them from the threats and media campaign against them which had intimidated and dissuaded them from continuing to express their opinion on public matters the relevant part of article reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the parties submissions the government the government submitted that the applicants had failed to exhaust all effective domestic remedies instead of wrongly submitting a criminal complaint a they should have requested publication of their reply or a rectification of the published information if necessary by addressing their complaint to the courts b they should have asked the courts to establish whether publishing certain information had violated the prohibition of hate speech or the right to dignity and they could have sought the removal or destruction of the media product c they could have sought compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage for a violation of their honour and reputation under the public information and media act andor the obligations act d they could have lodged a complaint with the regulatory body for electronic media indicating a violation of their right to dignity and of the prohibition of hate speech andor e they could have lodged a private claim for the criminal offence of insult see paragraphs and above in that order the government referred to the relevant domestic caselaw in this regard see paragraph above as the state provided for a number of effective mechanisms for the protection of the applicants freedom of expression there had been no violation of the positive obligation stemming from article and the applicants complaint was manifestly illfounded the government further submitted that there had been no incitement to violence threats or physical attacks against the applicants nor had there been any direct threats in the readers comments published online the applicants comparison of their alleged persecution with the case of the murder of a wellknown belgrade journalist slavko ćuruvija in was utterly pointless and exaggerated the article published on may had expressed an opinion of its author see paragraph above and the title of the article of june could be considered sensationalist see paragraph above but could not lead to the conclusion that the applicants had been accused of preparing an assassination of the prime minister in any event however the forum to discuss this was not the court but rather the domestic courts also the applicants had continued to publicly criticise the ruling party and the highest state officials see paragraphs above therefore their freedom of expression had been neither violated nor restricted the government agreed with the conclusions of the high public prosecutor and maintained that both the high public prosecutors office and the police had acted efficiently on the applicants criminal complaint as there had been no threats against the applicants there had been no criminal offence of endangering the safety of others either as the latter required a direct clear and unambiguous threat that there would be an attack on another persons life or body see paragraph above the government submitted that the applicants claim that the atmosphere in which journalists worked in serbia was generally negative simply could not stand and that serbia was making efforts to ensure an adequate response to the endangering of the safety of journalists they referred to the european commissions annual report in that regard see paragraph above the freedom house and european parliament reports contained general comments and conclusions on mediarelated problems in serbia and were thus irrelevant for the outcome in the present case the applicants the applicants contested the governments submissions and reaffirmed their complaint they submitted that they had not been obliged to make use of the legal remedies proposed by the government as these were mainly civil remedies used in cases where there had been primarily a violation of the right to reputation and as such they could not address the violation complained of notably the allegations made had amounted to the spreading of ideas and theories advocating hatred discrimination and violence against the applicants and all those who had been supporting the protests in serbia in particular they had been accused of being traitors and extremists who had been planning violent demonstrations and revolution and who had wished to destabilise the state and assassinate the prime minister which had been accompanied by their pictures also the first applicant had been directly accused of personally cooperating with foreign ambassadors and exchanging plans for organising violent protests across serbia these accusations had to be read together with the threats written in the comments below the text as well as the general atmosphere in serbia although harmful to their reputation those accusations had primarily made them fear for their safety if they were to continue their criticism by associating them with foreign agencies the applicants had been prevented from enjoying their right to freedom of expression since they had felt threatened they had been persecuted and discriminated against simply because they had had different political views and had not supported certain projects as they had feared potential violence they had sought protection from the criminal justice system the aim of such proceedings had not been to repair the damage inflicted on their honour and reputation but rather to put an end to further persecution and punish those responsible for it they submitted that the situation in the country justified their fear and referred to the number of attacks registered and the freedom house and eu reports on serbia see paragraphs above in particular a pattern of retribution against highprofile critics of the government had contributed to an increasingly hostile environment for free expression and open debate both the informer and tv pink were considered progovernment media and it was quite common for these media to lead long smear campaigns against those who criticised the government or public officials such campaigns often represented a call for a kind of physical confrontation with such persons especially when they were accused of destabilising the state and institutions or when they were linked to foreign agencies which sometimes ended with the most tragic consequences they referred to the assassination of slavko ćuruvija and maintained that the article written before his assassination was often perceived as representing a media announcement of his murder see paragraph above it was therefore highly probable that there could be violence and in such situations the national authorities had an obligation to carefully assess all the facts and protect the applicants and their freedom of expression however the national authorities had not conducted a proper investigation they had not interviewed all the suspects nor considered other potential criminal offences subject to public prosecution such as endangerment of the safety of others or a violation of freedom of speech and public appearance nor addressed the readers comments see paragraphs and above in that order by failing to assess all the facts and protect them the authorities had sent a message to everyone critical of public officials that smear campaigns were allowed in serbia smear campaigns such as the one in the present case had the aim of causing a chilling effect and preventing their victims that is the applicants from criticising publicly given the whole context the nature of the disputed texts and the readers comments the applicants had had reason to fear for their safety which had affected their freedom of expression notably they had stopped openly criticising the said projects and procedures because of their fear the fact that they had continued to criticise the authorities did not change the fact that their freedom of expression had been endangered during the smear campaign in the media and for a certain period afterwards the courts assessment admissibility the government made an objection of nonexhaustion by referring to several remedies which the applicants should have used the relevant principles as regards the exhaustion of domestic remedies are set out in vučković and others v serbia preliminary objection gc nos and others march the court reiterates in particular that if more than one potentially effective remedy is available the applicant is only required to have used one of them see aquilina v malta gc no echr iii the court notes in this regard that the applicants made use of a criminallaw remedy which does not seem to be futile the governments objection must therefore be dismissed the court notes that the applicants complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merits the court reiterates the key importance of freedom of expression as one of the preconditions for a functioning democracy genuine effective exercise of this freedom does not depend merely on the states duty not to interfere but may require positive measures of protection even in the sphere of relations between individuals see özgür gündem v turkey no echr iii appleby and others v the united kingdom no echr vi dink v turkey nos and others september palomo sánchez and others v spain gc nos and others echr and huseynova v azerbaijan no april in determining whether or not a positive obligation exists regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the general interest of the community and the interests of the individual the search for which is inherent throughout the convention the scope of this obligation will inevitably vary having regard to the diversity of situations obtaining in contracting states the difficulties involved in policing modern societies and the choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources nor must such an obligation be interpreted in such a way as to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities see özgür gündem cited above in particular the positive obligations under article of the convention require states to create while establishing an effective system for the protection of journalists a favourable environment for participation in public debate by all the persons concerned enabling them to express their opinions and ideas without fear even if they run counter to those defended by the official authorities or by a significant part of public opinion or even if irritating or shocking to the latter see dink and huseynova both cited above see also khadija ismayilova v azerbaijan nos and january turning to the present case the court notes that the applicants are journalists and civilsector activists who took part in protests criticising the demolition of certain houses and installations a largescale construction project in belgrade and the changes in the management of a regional radiotelevision station this was followed by two articles published on may and june suggesting that the real organisers and financers of the protests were the european union and the united states of america who wanted to radicalise the protests with the ultimate aim of overthrowing the serbian prime minister and that a number of persons from serbia including the applicants were participating in that project the allegations made in this article were repeated on may and and june see paragraphs above the applicants submitted that these allegations had made them feel threatened which was why they had resorted to a criminal complaint they maintained that the national authorities had had an obligation to carefully assess all the facts and protect the applicants but they had failed to do so see paragraph above the court notes that even though the applicants submitted that they had felt threatened following the publication of the above articles and broadcasting of the programmes in question none of them has ever in fact been subjected to any act of violence see mutatis mutandis huseynova cited above contrast khadija ismayilova cited above they brought their concern and fear to the attention of the authorities by lodging a criminal complaint for discrimination and a breach of the right to equality against several private individuals which was processed promptly contrast özgür gündem cited above where the domestic authorities which were aware of a series of violent actions against a newspaper and people associated with it did not take any action to protect the newspaper and its journalists while it is true that the police did not interview all the persons against whom the complaint had been made the court notes that the factual situation was more or less undisputed among the parties and a decision not to interview all of them in such a situation does not seem unreasonable or arbitrary on the basis of the information collected the prosecutor rejected the applicants criminal complaint as there were no grounds to believe that the persons in question had committed any of the alleged criminal offences contrary to the applicants submissions the prosecutor also held that there were no grounds to believe that any other criminal offence subject to public prosecution had been committed either see paragraphs and above the court also notes that it is not for it to rule on the constituent elements under domestic law of the offences of discrimination and a breach of the right to equality or any other offence for that matter see mutatis mutandis fatullayev v azerbaijan no april and dmitriyevskiy v russia no october it is primarily for the national authorities in particular the courts to interpret and apply domestic law see de tommaso v italy gc no february the courts role is rather to review under article the decisions that domestic courts deliver pursuant to their power of appreciation in doing so it must satisfy itself that the national authorities based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see kudrevičius and others v lithuania gc no echr and belkacem v belgium dec no june in view of the content of the articles and television shows in question and that of the applicants criminal complaint the court is not convinced that the decision of the relevant prosecutor was not based on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts the court observes that the prosecutor went even further suggesting that the allegations in question amounted perhaps to the criminal offence of insult which was subject to private prosecution the applicants did not however pursue this avenue it is further observed that the national legislation provides for a number of other remedies offering the applicants protection of their freedom of expression had they felt that it had been interfered with these included in particular civil proceedings for a violation of the prohibition of hate speech as well as civil proceedings for claiming compensation requesting a reply to andor rectification of information published and a number of measures pronounced by the regulatory body for electronic media see paragraphs above the government submitted abundant domestic caselaw for each of the remedies in question in all of them the courts and the regulatory body ruled in favour of various claimants and ordered that either a reply to or a rectification of information be published found violations of hate speech and ordered the respondent party to publish the judgments in question ordered compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage for a violation of their honour and reputation or their dignity and presumption of innocence caused by untrue andor forbidden information being published about them or issued warning and notices or banned further publishing of the particular content see paragraphs above in some of them the respondent parties were the same media companies against whose editorsinchief the applicants had lodged their own criminal complaint and in some of them the courts dealt with thirdparties comments too see paragraphs and above the applicants did not deny that these other remedies were available to them the court also takes note of the reports on the situation in serbia concerning the freedom of expression and safety of journalists and the reports of physical attacks and other types of alleged persecution of journalists however given the specific circumstances of the present case the court considers that the prosecutors findings were not arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable and nor did they rely on an unacceptable assessment of the relevant facts it also finds that the respondent state offered a number of other effective means for the protection of the applicants which they have not made use of in view of all of the above the court does not find that the respondent state failed in their positive obligation to protect the applicants freedom of expression there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimouslydeclares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rules of court hasan bakırcı jon fridrik kjølbro registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the separate opinion of judge koskelo is annexed to this judgment jfkhb concurring opinion of judge koskelo i have joined the majority in concluding that there has been no violation of article in the present case but i have done so with considerable hesitation i will briefly set out the reasons for this the factual background to the case in a nutshell is the following the applicants as journalists and civilsociety activists exercised their freedoms of expression and assembly in relation to commonplace matters of general interest see paragraph of the present judgment in the wake of those activities they were targeted on the website of a rightwing movement and in certain progovernment media with very serious and repeated accusations alleging that the applicants through their association with protests organised under the banner dont let belgrade drown were involved in a foreignled conspiracy by extremists directed against the elected government and aimed at its overthrow or even the assassination of the prime minister the applicants sought in vain to obtain protection by the domestic criminal justice system according to the competent prosecuting authorities there was no ground to believe that any criminal offence which was subject to public prosecution had been committed they considered that the reported actions had had no consequences and entailed no deprivation or restriction of anyones rights nor had the publication of the articles promoted or incited hatred discrimination or violence against any groups based on their religion nationality or other personal characteristic it was acknowledged that the reported acts could perhaps have been classified as an insult which however was not subject to public prosecution the applicants subsequent constitutional appeal was rejected it is well known that the courts approach has been critical and restrictive towards the use of criminal remedies in the context of measures by state authorities to sanction the exercise of freedom of expression in many situations there are very wellfounded and solid reasons to justify that approach indeed there are obvious risks involved in recourse being had to the repressive penal powers of the state especially when it comes to interferences in the exercise of criticism directed at institutions or persons in positions of power that being said any assessment of the acts or omissions of state authorities whether in the field of their negative or positive obligations under the convention must however remain sensitive to the context and adequately differentiated according to the specific circumstances what is at issue in the present case are accusations directed at the applicants by other private actors denouncing and discrediting them on account of the protest activities in which they participated given the very serious nature of the accusations levelled against the applicants and the general context it seems wellfounded to consider as the applicants did that the actions they complained of went beyond mere insults indeed it appears that freedom of expression was employed against the applicants with a view to suppressing their freedoms to act and express their opinions thus the present case is not about any chilling effect that might arise from sanctions applied against those who engage in criticism it is on the contrary about the chilling effect that risks being created through the failure to impose sanctions on those who seek to attack others for the usual exercise of their freedoms and who do so not by engaging in an exchange of arguments on the subject matter of the issues addressed but through attempts to stigmatise the opponents as traitors and conspirators that is to say enemies of the state instead of treating them as legitimate participants and interlocutors in the normal affairs and controversies of society the dangers of such aggressive potentially toxic and intimidating smear campaigns for the conditions and the quality of necessary democratic debates and exchanges of arguments should not be underestimated after all the ultimate aim of freedom of expression is to enable and to maintain democracy not to undermine it therefore it is indeed very important in the interest of protecting democracy to uphold the positive obligations incumbent on the states parties to create by establishing an effective system for the protection of journalists as well as members of civil society a favourable environment for participation in public debate this should enable the expression of opinions and ideas without fear even if they may run counter to those defended by the official authorities or by a significant part of public opinion see khadija ismayilova v azerbaijan nos and january in this context the availability of recourse to various civil remedies alone may not be sufficient especially in terms of the necessary dissuasive effect i note for instance that in the domestic civil judgment mentioned in paragraph of the present judgment the award of compensation amounted to serbian dinars equivalent to no more than roughly euros even where outright hate speech is not involved acts amounting to intimidation smear campaigns or other forms of persistent harassment aimed at others because of their normal exercise of freedoms under article may reasonably call for a reaction and protection of the victims by the criminal justice system this may be particularly relevant if suppressive actions by some actors or groups directed at those holding and expressing different views become a more general pattern of behaviour in this regard one must note with concern the information contained in paragraphs of the present judgment relating to the general environment of media freedom and debate in the respondent state in my view the circumstances of the case together with the more general context were of such a nature as to create a heightened duty of scrutiny on the part of the domestic authorities in connection with the positive obligations arising for them under article given the very limited and superficial reasoning provided see paragraph of the judgment i remain in doubt as to whether the domestic authorities primarily the prosecution service actually conducted a sufficiently thorough assessment of the applicants grievances in particular as regards the offence set out in article of the criminal code as that provision concerns an offence which is subject to public prosecution it fell to be considered even if it was not expressly referred to by the applicants themselves given the inherent limits of the information accessible in the materials before us and the necessary caution mandated by the partial view available to us i have voted in favour of finding no violation despite the doubts expressed above,,,

statements she had made during the seminars which had been directed against the doctrines of islam on august the vienna public prosecutors office staatsanwaltschaft wien the public prosecutor brought charges against the applicant pursuant to article of the criminal code for inciting to hatred verhetzung hearings were held on november and on january and february at the hearing on january the vienna regional criminal court landesgericht für strafsachen wien the regional court informed the applicant that the court might adopt a different legal classification in the matter from the one contained in the charge the hearing was therefore postponed to give her time to properly prepare a defence at the end of the hearing on february the regional court acquitted the applicant in relation to several of the statements originally included in the indictment under article of the criminal code this was partly because the public prosecutor had withdrawn the indictment concerning certain statements and partly because it could not be established that the applicant had made some of the other statements exactly or at least approximately as they were worded in the indictment she was however convicted of disparaging religious doctrines herabwürdigung religiöser lehren pursuant to article of the criminal code concerning the three remaining statements she was ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings and a dayfine of euros eur for a period of days amounting to eur in total which would result in sixty days imprisonment in the event of default the court considered the applicants repeated infringements to be an aggravating factor and the fact that she did not have a previous criminal record to be a mitigating factor the court found her guilty of publicly disparaging an object of veneration of a domestic church or religious society namely muhammad the prophet of islam in a manner capable of arousing justified indignation geeignet berechtigtes ärgernis zu erregen the statements which the court found incriminating were the following english translation i one of the biggest problems we are facing today is that muhammad is seen as the ideal man the perfect human the perfect muslim that means that the highest commandment for a male muslim is to imitate muhammad to live his life this does not happen according to our social standards and laws because he was a warlord he had many women to put it like this and liked to do it with children and according to our standards he was not a perfect human we have huge problems with that today that muslims get into conflict with democracy and our value system the most important of all hadith collections recognised by all legal schools the most important is the sahih al bukhari if a hadith was quoted after bukhari one can be sure that all muslims would recognise it and unfortunately in al bukhari the thing with aisha and child sex is written ii i remember my sister i have said this several times already when sw made her famous statement in graz my sister called me and asked for gods sake did you tell sw that to which i answered no it wasnt me but you can look it up its not really a secret and her you cant say it like that and me a yearold and a sixyearold what do you call that give me an example what do we call it if it is not paedophilia her well one has to paraphrase it say it in a more diplomatic way my sister is symptomatic we have heard that so many times those were different times it wasnt okay back then and its not okay today full stop and it is still happening today one can never approve of something like that they all create their own reality because the truth is so cruel german original i eines der großen probleme die wir heute haben ist dass mohammed als der ideale mann der perfekte mensch der perfekte muslim gesehen wird das heißt das oberste gebot für einen männlichen moslem ist es mohammed nachzumachen sein leben zu leben das läuft nicht nach unseren sozialen standards und gesetzen ab weil er war ein kriegsherr hatte einen relativ großen frauenverschleiß um das jetzt einmal so auszudrücken hatte nun mal gerne mit kindern ein bisschen was und er war nach unseren begriffen kein perfekter mensch damit haben wir heute riesige probleme weil muslime mit der demokratie und unserem wertesystem in konflikt geraten die wichtigsten von allen rechtsschulen anerkannten hadith sammlungen die allerwichtigste ist die sahih al bukhari wenn eine hadith nach bukhari zitiert wurde dann können sie sicher sein dass es alle muslime anerkennen und in der al bukhari ist auch blöderweise das geschrieben mit der aisha und dem kindersex ii ich erinnere mich an meine schwester das hab ich schon ein paar mal erzählt als sw in graz ihren berühmten sager gemacht hat ruft mich meine schwester an und sagt um gottes willen hast du ihr das gesagt worauf ich gesagt habe nein ich wars nicht aber es ist nachzulesen es ist nicht wirklich ein geheimnis und sie das kann man doch so nicht sagen und ich ein jähriger und eine jährige wie nennst du das gib mir ein beispiel wie nennen wir das wenns nicht pädophilie ist sie na ja das muss man ein bisschen umschreiben diplomatischer sagen meine schwester ist symptomatisch das haben wir schon so oft gehört das waren doch andere zeiten das war damals nicht ok und es ist heute nicht ok punkt und es passiert heute auch noch so was ist nie gutzuheißen sie legen sich alle eine wirklichkeit zurecht weil die wahrheit so grausam ist the regional court found that the above statements essentially conveyed the message that muhammad had had paedophilic tendencies it stated that the applicant was referring to a marriage which muhammad had concluded with aisha a sixyearold and consummated when she had been nine the court found that by making those statements the applicant had suggested that muhammad was not a worthy subject of worship however it also found that it could not be established that the applicant had intended to decry all muslims she was not suggesting that all muslims were paedophiles but was criticising the unreflecting imitation of a role model according to the court the common definition of paedophilia was a primary sexual interest in children who had not yet reached puberty because paedophilia was behaviour which was ostracised by society and outlawed it was evident that the applicants statements were capable of causing indignation the court concluded that the applicant had intended to wrongfully accuse muhammad of having paedophilic tendencies even though criticising child marriages was justifiable she had accused a subject of religious worship of having a primary sexual interest in childrens bodies which she had deduced from his marriage with a child disregarding the point that the marriage had continued until the prophets death when aisha had already turned eighteen and had therefore passed the age of puberty in addition the court found that because of the public nature of the seminars which had not been limited to members of the freedom party it was conceivable that at least some of the participants might have been disturbed by the statements the regional court further stated that anyone who wished to exercise their rights under article of the convention was subject to duties and responsibilities such as refraining from making statements which hurt others without reason and therefore did not contribute to a debate of public interest a balancing exercise between the rights under article on the one hand and those under article on the other needed to be carried out the court considered that the applicants statements were not statements of fact but derogatory value judgments which exceeded the permissible limits it held that the applicant had not intended to approach the topic in an objective manner but had directly aimed to degrade muhammad the court stated that child marriages were not the same as paedophilia and were not only a phenomenon of islam but also used to be widespread among the european ruling dynasties furthermore the court reasoned that freedom of religion as protected by article of the convention was one of the foundations of a democratic society those who invoked their freedom of religion could not expect to be exempt from criticism and even had to accept the negation of their beliefs however the manner in which religious views were attacked could engage the states responsibility in order to guarantee the peaceful exercise of the rights under article presenting objects of religious worship in a provocative way capable of hurting the feelings of the followers of that religion could be conceived as a malicious violation of the spirit of tolerance which was one of the bases of a democratic society the court concluded that the interference with the applicants freedom of expression in the form of a criminal conviction had been justified as it had been based in law and had been necessary in a democratic society namely in order to protect religious peace in austria the applicant appealed arguing that the impugned statements were statements of fact not value judgments she referred to several of the documents which she had submitted as evidence which in her view clearly confirmed that when muhammad had been fiftysix years old he had had sexual intercourse with the nineyearold aisha she stated that it was no more than reasonable to present those facts in the light of the values of todays society it had not been her intention to disparage muhammad she had merely criticised the notion that an adult had had sexual intercourse with a nineyearold child and raised the question whether this amounted to paedophilia if one were to follow the arguments of the regional court it would mean that someone who had married a child and managed to maintain the marriage until the child had come of age could not be described as a paedophile she further contended that she had not used the term paedophile in the strict scientific sense but in the way it was used in everyday language referring to men who had sex with minors she stated that she had never said that muhammad had been a paedophile because he had married a child but because he had had sexual intercourse with one in any event her statements were covered by her rights under article of the convention which included the right to impart opinions and ideas that offended shocked or disturbed on december the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht wien hereinafter the court of appeal dismissed the applicants appeal confirming in essence the legal and factual findings of the lower court the regional court had based its findings on the facts as submitted by the applicant namely that muhammad had married aisha when she had been six years old and consummated the marriage when she had been nine it had rightly made a distinction between child marriages and paedophilia it had not based its findings on an unpredictable definition of the term paedophilia but on a common definition which was comparable to that used by the world health organisation as regards the alleged violation of article of the convention the court of appeal referring to the courts caselaw i̇a v turkey no echr viii and aydın tatlav v turkey no may found that it had to examine whether the comments at issue were merely provocative or had been intended as an abusive attack on the prophet of islam it concluded that the latter was the case as muslims would find the applicants statements he liked to do it with children the thing with aisha and child sex and a yearold and a sixyearold what do you call that give me an example what do we call it if it is not paedophilia wrong and offensive even if muhammad had married a sixyearold and had had intercourse with her when she had been nine the court of appeal stated that the reason for the applicants conviction had not been that the events had purportedly taken place more than a thousand years ago and similar conduct would no longer be tolerable under todays criminal law and contemporary moral and value concepts but because the applicant had accused muhammad of paedophilia by using the plural form children child sex what do we call it if it is not paedophilia without providing evidence that his primary sexual interest in aisha had been her not yet having reached puberty moreover there were no reliable sources for that allegation as no documentary evidence existed to suggest that his other wives or concubines had been similarly young on the contrary his first wife had been fifteen years older than him as could be seen from the documents submitted by the applicant herself even if the applicant had had the right to criticise others attempts to imitate muhammad her statements showed her intention to unnecessarily disparage and deride muslims harsh criticism of churches or religious societies religionsgesellschaften and religious traditions and practices was lawful however the permissible limits were exceeded where criticism ended and insults or mockery of a religious belief or person of worship beschimpfung oder verspottung einer religion oder von ihr verehrten personen began the interference with the applicants freedoms under article of the convention had therefore been justified as to the applicants argument that those who had participated in the seminar knew of her critical approach and could not be offended the court of appeal found that the public seminar had been offered for free to young voters by the austrian freedom party education institute and at least one participant had been offended as her complaints had led to the applicant being charged on april the applicant lodged a request for a renewal of the proceedings antrag auf erneuerung des strafverfahrens with the supreme court oberster gerichtshof pursuant to article a of the code of criminal procedure strafprozessordnung and relying on article article and article of the convention on june the applicant lodged her application with the court on december the supreme court dismissed the request for a renewal of the proceedings as regards the alleged violation of article it found that the applicants conviction under article of the criminal code constituted an interference with the right to freedom of expression which had however been justified under article of the convention referring to the courts caselaw otto preminger institut v austria september series a no a i̇a cited above wingrove v the united kingdom november reports of judgments and decisions v aydın tatlav cited above and giniewski v france no echr i it held that the aim of the interference had been to protect religious peace and the religious feelings of others and was therefore legitimate the court had stated many times that in the context of religion member states had a duty to suppress certain forms of conduct or expression that were gratuitously offensive to others and profane in cases where the impugned statements not only offended or shocked or expressed a provocative opinion but had also been considered an abusive attack on a religious group for example an abusive attack on the prophet of islam as in the applicants case a criminal conviction might be necessary to protect the freedom of religion of others where a conviction was based on article of the criminal code the principles developed under article and of the convention had to be considered when examining whether a statement was capable of arousing justified indignation a statement could not be considered as arousing indignation if it was compatible with articles and of the convention the courts therefore had to examine the meaning of the impugned statement as well as the context in which it had been made and whether the statement was based on fact or was a value judgment only by considering all of those points could the question of the ability to arouse justified indignation be examined applying the above considerations to the applicants case the supreme court held that she had not aimed to contribute to a serious debate about islam or the phenomenon of child marriage but merely to defame muhammad by accusing him of a specific sexual preference based on the assumption that he had had sexual intercourse with a prepubescent child in order to show that he was not a worthy subject of worship the court whilst not misjudging the importance of the debate about sexual contact between adults and children found that the applicant had not contributed to a debate of general interest because she had made her allegation primarily in order to defame muhammad on the basis of the regional courts findings that the applicants statements qualified as value judgments the supreme court held that they had not been a contribution to a serious debate the case had to be distinguished from the case of aydın tatlav cited above in which a scientific book published in its fifth edition had contained a passage of harsh criticism of religion which had not been offensive in the present case the criminal conviction constituted a measure necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention moreover the measure taken by the criminal court had also been proportionate as the applicant had only been ordered to pay a fine of eur the supreme court therefore dismissed the applicants request for a renewal of the proceedings the supreme courts judgment was served on the applicants counsel on january ii relevant domestic law article of the criminal code is part of section of the criminal code which inter alia lists criminally punishable offences against religious peace strafbare handlungen gegen den religiösen frieden it reads as follows article disparagement of religious doctrines whoever in circumstances where his or her behaviour is likely to arouse justified indignation publicly disparages or insults a person who or an object which is an object of veneration of a church or religious community established within the country or a dogma a lawful custom or a lawful institution of such a church or religious community shall be liable to up to six months imprisonment or a dayfine for a period of up to days article of the criminal code as in force at the relevant time read as follows article incitement to hatred whoever in a manner capable of endangering public order publicly incites to commit a hostile act against a church or religious community established within the country or against a group defined by its belonging to such a church or religious community a race a nation a tribe or a state shall be liable to up to two years imprisonment similarly whoever publicly incites against a group defined in paragraph or tries to insult or disparage it in a manner violating human dignity shall equally be held liable iii international material article of the united nations international covenant on civil and political rights provides any advocacy of national racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law the council of europe parliamentary assembly stated in its recommendation on blasphemy religious insults and hate speech against persons on grounds of their religion with regard to blasphemy religious insults and hate speech against persons on the grounds of their religion the state is responsible for determining what should count as criminal offences within the limits imposed by the case law of the european court of human rights in this connection the assembly considers that blasphemy as an insult to a religion should not be deemed a criminal offence a distinction should be made between matters relating to moral conscience and those relating to what is lawful matters which belong to the public domain and those which belong to the private sphere even though today prosecutions in this respect are rare in member states they are legion in other countries of the world the assembly notes that member states have the obligation under article of the convention to protect freedom of religion including the freedom to manifest ones religion this requires that member states protect such manifestations against disturbances by others however these rights may sometimes be subject to certain justified limitations the challenge facing the authorities is how to strike a fair balance between the interests of individuals as members of a religious community in ensuring respect for their right to manifest their religion or their right to education and the general public interest or the rights and interests of others the assembly considers that as far as it is necessary in a democratic society in accordance with article paragraph of the convention national law should only penalise expressions about religious matters which intentionally and severely disturb public order and call for public violence the european commission for democracy through law the venice commission stated in its report on the relationship between freedom of expression and freedom of religion the issue of regulation and prosecution of blasphemy religious insult and incitement to religious hatred cdlad as concerns the question of whether or not there is a need for specific supplementary legislation in the area of blasphemy religious insult and incitement to religious hatred the commission findsa that incitement to hatred including religious hatred should be the object of criminal sanctions as is the case in almost all european states b that it is neither necessary nor desirable to create an offence of religious insult that is insult to religious feelings simpliciter without the element of incitement to hatred as an essential componentc that the offence of blasphemy should be abolished which is already the case in most european states and should not be reintroduced as concerns the question of to what extent criminal legislation is adequate andor effective for the purpose of bringing about the appropriate balance between the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for ones beliefs the commission reiterates that in its view criminal sanctions are only appropriate in respect of incitement to hatred unless public order offences are appropriate notwithstanding the difficulties with enforcement of criminal legislation in this area there is a high symbolic value in the pan european introduction of criminal sanctions against incitement to hatred it gives strong signals to all parts of society and to all societies that an effective democracy can not bear behaviours and acts which undermine its core values pluralism tolerance respect for human rights and nondiscrimination it is essential however that the application of legislation against incitement to hatred be done in a nondiscriminatory manner in the commissions view instead criminal sanctions are inappropriate in respect of insult to religious feelings and even more so in respect of blasphemy the united nations human rights council stated in its resolution combating intolerance negative stereotyping and stigmatization of and discrimination incitement to violence and violence against persons based on religion or belief adopted on march the human rights council expresses its concern that incidents of religious intolerance discrimination and related violence as well as of negative stereotyping of individuals on the basis of religion or belief continue to rise around the world and condemns in this context any advocacy of religious hatred against individuals that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence and urges states to take effective measures as set forth in the present resolution consistent with their obligations under international human rights law to address and combat such incidents notes the speech given by secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference at the fifteenth session of the human rights council and draws on his call on states to take the following actions to foster a domestic environment of religious tolerance peace and respect bye speaking out against intolerance including advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violencef adopting measures to criminalize incitement to imminent violence based on religion or beliefg understanding the need to combat denigration and negative religious stereotyping of persons as well as incitement to religious hatred by strategizing and harmonizing actions at the local national regional and international levels through inter alia education and awarenessbuildingh recognizing that the open constructive and respectful debate of ideas as well as interfaith and intercultural dialogue at the local national and international levels can play a positive role in combating religious hatred incitement and violence the un human rights committee adopted at its nd session july the general comment no on freedom of opinion and freedom of expression freedom of expression is a necessary condition for the realization of the principles of transparency and accountability that are in turn essential for the promotion and protection of human rights defamation laws must be crafted with care to ensure that they comply with paragraph and that they do not serve in practice to stifle freedom of expression all such laws in particular penal defamation laws should include such defences as the defence of truth and they should not be applied with regard to those forms of expression that are not of their nature subject to verification at least with regard to comments about public figures consideration should be given to avoiding penalizing or otherwise rendering unlawful untrue statements that have been published in error but without malice in any event a public interest in the subject matter of the criticism should be recognized as a defence care should be taken by states parties to avoid excessively punitive measures and penalties where relevant states parties should place reasonable limits on the requirement for a defendant to reimburse the expenses of the successful party states parties should consider the decriminalization of defamation and in any case the application of the criminal law should only be countenanced in the most serious of cases and imprisonment is never an appropriate penalty it is impermissible for a state party to indict a person for criminal defamation but then not to proceed to trial expeditiously such a practice has a chilling effect that may unduly restrict the exercise of freedom of expression of the person concerned and others prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system including blasphemy laws are incompatible with the covenant except in the specific circumstances envisaged in article paragraph of the covenant thus for instance it would be impermissible for any such laws to discriminate in favour of or against one or certain religions or belief systems or their adherents over another or religious believers over nonbelievers nor would it be permissible for such prohibitions to be used to prevent or punish criticism of religious leaders or commentary on religious doctrine and tenets of faith laws that penalize the expression of opinions about historical facts are incompatible with the obligations that the covenant imposes on states parties in relation to the respect for freedom of opinion and expression the covenant does not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events restrictions on the right of freedom of opinion should never be imposed and with regard to freedom of expression they should not go beyond what is permitted in paragraph or required under article the european parliament in its resolution of february on the situation of fundamental rights in the european union ini held that the european parliament recalls that national laws that criminalise blasphemy restrict freedom of expression concerning religious or other beliefs that they are often applied to persecute mistreat or intimidate persons belonging to religious or other minorities and that they can have a serious inhibiting effect on freedom of expression and on freedom of religion or belief recommends that the member states decriminalise such offences the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant alleged that her criminal conviction for disparaging religious doctrines had given rise to a violation of article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions the applicant considered that her conviction for the abovementioned statements had amounted to an unlawful interference with her right to freedom of expression referring to the courts caselaw she considered that the domestic courts had failed to address the substance of the impugned statements in the light of article of the convention if they had done so they would not have qualified them as mere value judgments value judgments were only excessive if they were not linked to facts whereas her incriminated statements had been based on facts the applicant stressed that by stating that muhammad had had sexual intercourse with a nineyearold she had quoted a historically proven fact and raised the question whether this could be regarded as paedophilia thus she had based her value judgment on facts which was always permissible under article of the convention furthermore through the impugned statements she had expressed criticism concerning islam and the unreflecting imitation of muhammad in the framework of an objective and lively discussion which the domestic courts had failed to take into account against that background this had been an objective criticism of religion had contributed to a public debate and had not been aimed at defaming the prophet of islam consequently contrary to the domestic courts reasoning a sufficient factual basis had existed for her assessment that muhammads behaviour had amounted to paedophilia she added that she had held a seminar extending over a number of days with an overall duration of twelve hours and therefore a few individual statements had to be tolerated in order to allow for a lively discussion which was a necessary part of such a seminar the applicant further submitted that religious groups had to be regarded as public institutions and therefore had to tolerate even severe criticism referring inter alia to the courts judgments in aydın tatlav giniewski both cited above and gündüz v turkey no echr xi the applicant alleged that improper attacks on religious groups had to be tolerated even if they were based on untrue facts as long as they did not incite to violence moreover the rights guaranteed under article of the convention did not imply a ban on the propagation by others of a doctrine which was hostile to other peoples faiths only expressions that were gratuitously offensive to others and thus an infringement of their rights and which therefore did not contribute to any form of public debate should be prohibited by law whereas blasphemy laws providing for a criminal sanction should be avoided according to international law standards she contrasted her case with the courts judgment in i̇a v turkey cited above as the impugned statement at issue in i̇a had not been linked to facts in relation to the question of the legitimate aim of the applicants criminal conviction the government submitted that article of the criminal code did not prohibit critical or offensive statements about a church or religious community per se but merely regulated the manner in which such statements could be made as the explanatory notes on the government bill erläuternde bemerkungen zur regierungsvorlage rv blg nr xiii gp pg et seq stated the primary purpose of that provision was to protect religious peace which was an important element of general peace within a state religious peace was to be understood as the peaceful coexistence of the various churches and religious communities with each other as well as with those who did not belong to a church or religious community the government concluded that the applicants criminal conviction had pursued the legitimate aim of maintaining order protecting religious peace and protecting the rights of others namely their religious feelings the government argued that in their examination of the impugned statements the domestic courts had in accordance with the courts case law balanced the right of the applicant to disclose her views to the general public against the rights of others to respect for their religious freedom they had comprehensively addressed the substance of the impugned statements and concluded that they had not been part of an objective discussion concerning islam and child marriage but had rather been aimed at defaming muhammad and therefore had been capable of arousing justified indignation the government reiterated that the supreme court had acknowledged that the issue of adults having sexual contact with minors gave rise to a public debate and the limits of acceptable criticism were therefore wider however the applicants statements in substance accused muhammad of paedophilia and in that respect lacked a sufficient factual basis they were disparaging towards muhammad and therefore had not contributed to an objective public debate referring to the courts caselaw the government pointed out that critical statements regarded by believers as extremely insulting and provocative as well as general vehement attacks on a religious or ethnic group were incompatible with the values of tolerance social peace and nondiscrimination which underlay the convention and therefore were not protected by the right to freedom of expression lastly the imposed sanction had been a moderate dayfine of eur the legal minimum for a duration of days thus only a third of the possible maximum period of days the thirdparty intervener the european centre for law and justice as thirdparty intervener submitted that statements which amounted to value judgments but were not devoid of any factual basis contributed to a public debate and did not imminently incite to violence were permissible under article of the convention it observed that a criminal conviction which pursued the aim of protecting the belief itself rather than the believers feelings was one of blasphemy a criminal charge which according to international law standards should be abolished it argued that article of the criminal code served as a deterrent chilling effect obstructing free debate having recourse to a criminal sanction rather than a civillaw one to protect freedom of religion was not necessary in a democratic society the courts assessment the court considers and this was common ground between the parties that the criminal conviction giving rise to the instant case amounted to an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression such interference constitutes a breach of article unless it is prescribed by law pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph and is necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve the aim or aims in questiona prescribed by law the court notes that it was undisputed that the interference had been prescribed by law the applicants conviction being based on article of the criminal codeb legitimate aim while the applicant stressed that her statements had never been aimed at disparaging muhammad she did not dispute the legitimate purpose of criminal convictions under article of the criminal code namely to protect religious peace the court endorses the governments assessment that the impugned interference pursued the aim of preventing disorder by safeguarding religious peace as well as protecting religious feelings which corresponds to protecting the rights of others within the meaning of article of the conventionc necessary in a democratic societyi general principles the court reiterates the fundamental principles underlying its judgments relating to article as set out for example in handyside v the united kingdom december series a no and in fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb the court further notes that there is little scope under article of the convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate on questions of public interest see baka v hungary gc no echr and satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no echr extracts those who choose to exercise the freedom to manifest their religion under article of the convention irrespective of whether they do so as members of a religious majority or a minority therefore can not expect to be exempt from criticism they must tolerate and accept the denial by others of their religious beliefs and even the propagation by others of doctrines hostile to their faith see otto preminger institut i̇a v turkey and aydın tatlav all cited above as paragraph of article recognises however the exercise of the freedom of expression carries with it duties and responsibilities amongst them in the context of religious beliefs is the general requirement to ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under article to the holders of such beliefs including a duty to avoid as far as possible an expression that is in regard to objects of veneration gratuitously offensive to others and profane see sekmadienis ltd v lithuania no january with further references where such expressions go beyond the limits of a critical denial of other peoples religious beliefs and are likely to incite religious intolerance for example in the event of an improper or even abusive attack on an object of religious veneration a state may legitimately consider them to be incompatible with respect for the freedom of thought conscience and religion and take proportionate restrictive measures see for example mutatis mutandis otto preminger institut and i̇a v turkey both cited above in addition expressions that seek to spread incite or justify hatred based on intolerance including religious intolerance do not enjoy the protection afforded by article of the convention see mutatis mutandis gündüz cited above in examining whether restrictions on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the convention can be considered necessary in a democratic society the court has frequently held that the contracting states enjoy a certain margin of appreciation see for example wingrove cited above and and murphy v ireland no echr ix extracts the absence of a uniform european conception of the requirements of the protection of the rights of others in relation to attacks on their religious convictions broadens the contracting states margin of appreciation when regulating freedom of expression in relation to matters liable to offend personal convictions within the sphere of morals or religion see otto preminger institut wingrove i̇a giniewski and aydın tatlav all cited above not only do they enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in that respect they also have the positive obligation under article of the convention of ensuring the peaceful coexistence of all religions and those not belonging to a religious group by ensuring mutual tolerance see leyla şahin v turkey gc no echr xi and sas v france gc no echr extracts a state may therefore legitimately consider it necessary to take measures aimed at repressing certain forms of conduct including the imparting of information and ideas judged incompatible with respect for the freedom of thought conscience and religion of others see in the context of article kokkinakis v greece may series a no a see also otto preminger institut and aydın tatlav both cited above it is however for the court to give a final ruling on the restrictions compatibility with the convention and it will do so by assessing it in the circumstances of a particular case the issue before the court therefore involves weighing up the conflicting interests of the exercise of two fundamental freedoms namely the right of the applicant to impart to the public her views on religious doctrine on the one hand and the right of others to respect for their freedom of thought conscience and religion on the other see otto preminger institut and aydın tatlav both cited above in its caselaw the court has distinguished between statements of fact and value judgments the classification of a statement as fact or as a value judgment is a matter which first and foremost falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities in particular the domestic courts see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no however the court can change this classification when exercising its supervisory function see kharmalov v russia no october and pinto pinheiro marques v portugal no january in previous cases the court has emphasised that the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article however even where a statement amounts to a value judgment the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive as the court has noted in previous cases the difference lies in the degree of factual proof which has to be established see jerusalem v austria no echr ii feldek v slovakia no echr viii and genner v austria no january in exercising its supervisory function it is not the courts task to take the place of the national authorities but rather to review under article in the light of the case as a whole the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation particularly whether they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see vogt v germany september series a no and jerusalem cited above with further references and whether the interference corresponded to a pressing social need and was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued see i̇a cited above with further references in order to determine its proportionality the court must consider the impugned interference not only in the light of the content of the statements at issue but also the context in which they were made furthermore the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are also factors to be taken into account see for example gündüz cited above where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see von hannover v germany no gc nos and february ii application of the above principles to the instant case the court notes at the outset that the subject matter of the instant case is of a particularly sensitive nature and that the potential effects of the impugned statements depend to a certain degree on the situation in the country where the statements were made at the time and the context in which they were made accordingly and notwithstanding some of the domestic courts considerations such as the duration of the marriage in question the court therefore considers that the domestic authorities had a wide margin of appreciation in the instant case as they were in a better position to evaluate which statements were likely to disturb the religious peace in their country the court notes that the domestic courts considered the applicants statements as having been made in public see paragraph in fine above indeed the seminars were widely advertised to the public on the internet and via leaflets the latter were sent out by the head of the rightwing freedom party addressing them especially to young voters and praising them as top seminars in the framework of a free education package the applicants intervention was entitled basic information on islam and was meant to be a critical analysis of islamic doctrine allowing for a discussion with the participants of the seminars the title gave the in hindsight misleading impression that the seminars would include objective information on islam it appears that anyone interested was able to enrol there was no requirement to be a member of the freedom party the applicant therefore could not assume that there would only be likeminded people in the room who would share her very critical views of islam but had to expect that there could also be people among the audience who might be offended by her statements it is of little relevance that only thirty people attended on average the applicants statements were in fact recorded by a journalist who had participated in the seminar and whose employer subsequently reported them to the public prosecutor see paragraph above the court reiterates that a religious group must tolerate the denial by others of their religious beliefs and even the propagation by others of doctrines hostile to their faith as long as the statements at issue do not incite to hatred or religious intolerance article of the criminal code see paragraph above does not in fact incriminate all behaviour that is likely to hurt religious feelings or amounts to blasphemy but additionally requires that the circumstances of such behaviour were capable of arousing justified indignation and thus aims at the protection of religious peace and tolerance the court notes that the domestic courts explained extensively why they considered that the applicants statements had been capable of arousing justified indignation on the grounds that they had not been made in an objective manner aimed at contributing to a debate of public interest but could only be understood as having been aimed at demonstrating that muhammad was not a worthy subject of worship see paragraph above the court endorses this assessment when saying what do we call it if it is not paedophilia the applicant according to her own statements was quoting a conversation she had had with her sister who was of the opinion that one had to paraphrase the accusation that muhammad was a paedophile say it in a more diplomatic way the court notes that the applicant described herself as an expert in the field of islamic doctrine already having held seminars of that kind for a while her argument that the impugned statements had been made in the context of a lively discussion in which they could not be revoked see paragraph above is therefore not convincing contrast gündüz cited above the court therefore agrees with the domestic courts that the applicant must have been aware that her statements were partly based on untrue facts and liable to arouse justified indignation in others in that context the court reiterates that the convention states are required in accordance with their positive obligations under article of the convention to ensure the peaceful coexistence of religious and nonreligious groups and individuals under their jurisdiction by ensuring an atmosphere of mutual tolerance see paragraph above the court endorses the regional courts statement in its judgment of february that presenting objects of religious worship in a provocative way capable of hurting the feelings of the followers of that religion could be conceived as a malicious violation of the spirit of tolerance which was one of the bases of a democratic society see paragraph in fine above the court notes that the domestic courts qualified the impugned statements as value judgments based on a detailed analysis of the wording of the statements made see in particular paragraph above they found that the applicant had subjectively labelled muhammad with a general sexual preference for paedophilia and had failed to neutrally inform her audience of the historical background which consequently had not allowed for a serious debate on that issue see paragraphs and above the court therefore agrees with the domestic courts that the impugned statements can be classified as value judgments not having a sufficient factual basis even if they were to be classified as factual statements as the applicant insisted she failed to adduce any evidence to that end both during the domestic proceedings and before the court as to the applicants argument that a few individual statements had to be tolerated during a lively discussion the court considers that it is not compatible with article of the convention to package incriminating statements in the wrapping of an otherwise acceptable expression of opinion and deduce that this renders statements exceeding the permissible limits of freedom of expression passable moreover the applicant was wrong to assume that improper attacks on religious groups had to be tolerated even if they were based on untrue facts see paragraph above on the contrary the court has held that statements which are based on manifestly untrue facts do not enjoy the protection of article see mutatis mutandis giniewski cited above and medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no echr lastly the court reiterates that the applicant was ordered to pay a moderate fine of only eur in total for the three statements made although the criminal code alternatively provided for up to six months imprisonment furthermore the fine imposed was at the lower end of the statutory scale of punishment of up to dayfines namely only dayfines and the domestic courts applied only the minimum daily amount of eur although the applicant had no previous criminal record and this was taken into account as a mitigating factor her repeated infringements had to be considered as an aggravating factor under the circumstances the court does not consider the criminal sanction to be disproportionate in conclusion the court finds that in the instant case the domestic courts comprehensively assessed the wider context of the applicants statements and carefully balanced her right to freedom of expression with the rights of others to have their religious feelings protected and to have religious peace preserved in austrian society they discussed the permissible limits of criticism of religious doctrines versus their disparagement and found that the applicants statements had been likely to arouse justified indignation in muslims in addition the court considers that the impugned statements were not phrased in a neutral manner aimed at making an objective contribution to a public debate concerning child marriages contrast aydın tatlav and giniewski both cited above but amounted to a generalisation without a factual basis thus by considering them as going beyond the permissible limits of an objective debate and classifying them as an abusive attack on the prophet of islam which was capable of stirring up prejudice and putting religious peace at risk the domestic courts came to the conclusion that the facts at issue contained elements of incitement to religious intolerance the court accepts that they thereby put forward relevant and sufficient reasons and finds that the interference with the applicants rights under article did indeed correspond to a pressing social need and was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued therefore the court considers that the domestic courts did not overstep their wide margin of appreciation in the instant case when convicting the applicant of disparaging religious doctrines accordingly there has been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and

of company y had returned the money to his business partners in the film clip the applicant stated that the icelandic authorities believed that they had found the money trail and they thought that the money had made its way back to iceland not necessarily into bs pockets but into those of his business partners the applicant then speculated on who the business partners might be and pictures were shown inter alia of a a prominent businessman in iceland lastly the applicant stated that the question of where the money had ended up would be answered after the authorities investigation on the evening news on may the news anchor introduced the news items by stating that the authorities were investigating whether b a and c an investor in iceland had jointly planned a business deal where isk seemed to vanish in panama furthermore the anchor stated that documents from the year and onwards supported this suspicion and that the documents indicated that the money had found its way back into the pockets of the same group in the film clip the applicant stated that the authorities believed that they had found the money trail as had been previously reported and that they were in possession of documents indicating that a b and c had planned the panama deal in advance in order to send the money to panama and then back into their own pockets again via a circuitous route pictures of a b and c were shown on the screen with the text under investigation written below each picture on the evening news on december the news anchor introduced the news item in the film clip the applicant stated that in the spring of company y had loaned isk to the company in panama the funds had been transferred to panama on april and six days later on april a loan agreement had been prepared on the same day the loan had been written off in its entirety from the accounts of company y furthermore the applicant stated that b had issued a declaration claiming that there was nothing suspicious about the loan lastly the applicant stated the icelandic authorities have also searched for the funds as we have previously reported and they believe that they have found the money trail as they have documents indicating that b a and c organised the panama deal in advance that is they sent the money to panama and later the money found its way back through several detours into the pockets of the threesome pictures of a b and c were shown above a world map a pile of money was shown being divided up into three parts in panama and each part was then visually transferred to the pictures of the men on the same day a corresponding article was published on ruvs website after the news broadcast a issued a press release the online news article was updated to include the press release on january a lodged defamation proceedings against the applicant before the reykjaness district court and requested that the words a and threesome in the abovementioned statement of the news item broadcast on december be declared null and void before the domestic courts the applicant maintained that he had based the news item on information from sources both verbal and written that he deemed highly trustworthy furthermore the applicant maintained that when he had prepared the news item he had attempted to contact a by telephone in vain during the proceedings before the district court the applicant submitted a letter dated september from the special prosecutor confirming that the loan transaction which was the subject of the news items had been reported to the police and was under investigation the special prosecutor also stated that this had been confirmed in the media in july it does not transpire from the letter from the special prosecutor whether a was under investigation as a suspect or charged the applicant did not during the proceedings before the district court submit any other documents or evidence to in support of the information concerning a presented in the news items by judgment of november the district court found for the applicant in its reasoning it referred to the right to freedom of expression and the protection of private life as guaranteed by the icelandic constitution the judgment contained the following reasoning the banking collapse of caused great changes to the business environment and society in general a wave of bankruptcies hit companies and individuals the value of the krona plummeted and changes were made to the ruling government to name a few the media have covered these events since the crisis began and the individuals involved have also been the subject of news coverage including a in determining whether the content of the news item is a part of the social debate and therefore of public interest it should be kept in mind that a himself as well as the companies he has represented has been in the media and public debate for many years a has also been very prominent in business both here and abroad and in both a negative and positive light company z led by a was a large shareholder in f and held an active share in gbank news about a has therefore more often than not been about his role in the banking collapse and after the collapse of the icelandic banks in the autumn of the media was full of news on the banking collapse and crisis the reasons behind them and related matters the media have been called upon to disseminate all material that could be of public interest especially if the content might shed light on elements pertaining to parties who have played key roles in the icelandic economy in the light of the circumstances that developed after the banking collapse a will have to withstand personal discussion of his actions and participation in business loan facilities and transfers of funds occurring in the leadup to the bank failure are important news stories that are relevant to the general public restricting that discussion through sanctions should only be done after great consideration the applicant has stated that the news item is based on sources both verbal and written that he finds trustworthy the applicant can not be asked to prove these statements as the journalists right to protect his sources and their identity has been upheld in judicial rulings the applicant has also sufficiently demonstrated that he tried to contact a before he delivered the news item and he has therefore not violated the national broadcasting services procedures in that respect the court does not agree with a that he is accused of actions punishable by law in the news item the news item must be assessed as a whole and not on the basis of individual statements in the piece as previously noted the court must consider the circumstances under which the statements are made that they are necessary for a social debate on the causes and repercussions of the bank failure and also that some discrepancies can occur when dealing with complicated loan facilities and business deals when the statements on a are assessed in this light they are not found to violate the provisions of articles or of the penal code no on january a appealed against the district courts judgment to the supreme court by a judgment of november the supreme court overturned the district court judgment and ordered the applicant to pay isk approximately euros eur to a in compensation for nonpecuniary damage plus interest and isk approximately eur for as legal costs before the domestic courts the two words were declared null and void the judgment contained the following reasoning in assessing where the line should be drawn between freedom of expression as protected by article of the constitution and the right to privacy as protected by article of the constitution it is important to determine whether the content published can be considered a part of the social debate and therefore of public interest see the supreme court judgments of june in case no march in case no november in case no and november in case no the media play an important role in disseminating information and opinions on social issues the public has a right to information on such issues and there must be particularly strong reasons for determining that limitations on media freedom are warranted in a democratic society the collapse that occurred in the icelandic economy following the failure of the three icelandic commercial banks in the autumn of has had a significant and broad effect on all activity in the country and the general publics quality of life public debate and media coverage have been very focused on identifying the preceding events and reasons for the collapse and reporting on the financial business of individuals has often been personal when the content of the news item debated in this case is assessed as a whole and the disputed remarks are evaluated in context with other statements in the news report and in consideration of the visual presentation the comments clearly implied that a had committed an act which was punishable in accordance with the penal code no the applicant has not presented any documents supporting the legitimacy of the statements for which he has to bear the burden as it was incumbent on him rather than a to secure such evidence the applicant has also not demonstrated that he sought information from a on the content while preparing the news report he therefore failed in his duty as outlined in article of the national broadcast services rules on news and related programming dated may to seek information from both or all parties and attempt to show their points of view as equally as possible the supreme court therefore finds that the applicant could not have been acting in good faith as pertains to the accuracy of the remarks in the news piece therefore as demand for the quoted statements to be declared null and void is granted pursuant to article cf article of the penal code ii relevant domestic law the relevant provisions of the icelandic constitution stjórnarskrá lýðveldisins íslands the penal code almenn hegningarlög and the tort liability act skaðabótalög are set out in the case of erla hlynsdottir v iceland no no to june section of

and producers shall not participate in the work of political parties or associations participation in other kinds of representative associations shall be with the knowledge of the news and production director the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the supreme courts judgment of november had entailed an interference with his right to freedom of expression that was not necessary in a democratic society and did not pursue a legitimate aim and thus violated article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissionsa the applicant the applicant maintained that article of the convention was not at issue in the case because the statements had not affected as reputation to a sufficient degree the statements were not defamatory or innuendoes against a there was nothing presented in the news item to the effect that a had been guilty of a financial crime or other actions punishable by law the applicant stated that the news item concerned reports of loan facilities and international financial transfers that had taken place before the financial crisis and it had contributed to an ongoing and pressing social debate on the circumstances in iceland leading up to the crisis in the media had been covering these events and the individuals involved including a who had been widely known as an important figure in the icelandic business sector prior to the financial crisis a had been in the spotlight a part of a public debate in iceland for a long time both in relation to his various business dealings and court proceedings and therefore he had to sustain closer scrutiny of his acts than a private individual or an ordinary professional in the applicants view the interests of a could not outweigh his freedom of expression when imparting information on important matters of legitimate public concern the applicant claimed that he had acted in good faith when preparing the news item relying on sufficiently accurate evidence verbal and written information from more than one source which he considered highly reliable the supreme court had expected him to present documents in the case which proved the legitimacy of the statements beyond doubt the burden of proof imposed on him by the supreme court had not been legitimate or possible to meet as he had the right to protect his sources and to keep them and the documentation behind news items confidential in addition he had tried to contact a via telephone and email when preparing the news piece after the broadcast a had released a press statement which was included in the corresponding news article online later the same day the applicant had therefore acted in good faith to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism the broadcast had been put forth in an objective manner and the style had not been provocative or exaggeratedb the government in the governments opinion the impugned restriction on the applicants exercise of freedom of expression had corresponded to a pressing social need and had been justified by relevant and sufficient reasons namely as reputation and honour the measures taken had been proportionate to the legitimate aimed pursued furthermore the supreme court in its assessment had applied the standards that were in conformity with the principles embodied in articles and of the convention as interpreted in the courts caselaw the government maintained that the statements including the impugned words had been statements of fact which the applicant had failed to present in a balanced manner the statements had been untrue and insinuated criminal behaviour on the part of a the applicant had lacked evidence to support the statements and his attempt to contact a to verify the information before the broadcast had been vague at best he had failed to abide by the journalistic duties identified by the court to prepare the material in good faith in the governments opinion the applicant should be required to verify statements made by his or her sources and thus exercise care in the gathering use and presentation of material the government claimed that even though the aftermath of the financial crisis in iceland in was an important social matter relevant to public debate the impugned statements had not contributed to public debate on social issues as regards the applicants claim about as press statement being published with the news article online the government maintained that this argument had not been a part of the applicants initial complaint and did not appear to have been raised before the domestic courts that indicated that the applicant had not been responsible for publishing the statement or even aware of it the courts assessmenta whether there was an interference it is common ground between the parties that the impugned judgment constituted an interference by a public authority with the applicants right to freedom of expression as guaranteed under the first paragraph of article b whether it was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim it is not in dispute that the impugned measure had a basis in articles s and of the penal code section of the broadcasting act and section of the tort liability act the court is moreover satisfied that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of othersc whether the interference was necessary in a democratic societyi general principles the principles concerning the question of whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the courts caselaw see among other authorities delfi as v estonia gc no to echr with further references the court has held that a persons reputation even if that person is being criticised in the context of a public debate forms part of his or her personal identity and psychological integrity and therefore falls within the scope of his or her private life in order for article to come into play the attack on personal honour and reputation must attain a certain level of gravity and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see inter alia a v norway no april having been required on numerous occasions to consider disputes requiring an examination of the fair balance to be struck between the right to respect for private life and the right to freedom of expression the court has developed general principles emerging from abundant caselaw in this area see among other authorities couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no to echr extracts the criteria which are relevant when balancing the right to freedom of expression against the right to respect for private life are inter alia the contribution to a debate of general interest how well known the person concerned is and what the subject of the report is his or her prior conduct the method of obtaining the information and its veracity the content form and consequences of the publication and the severity of the sanction imposed see for example axel springer ag v germany gc no and to february and von hannover v germany no gc nos and to echr finally the court recalls that where the national authorities have weighed up the interests at stake in compliance with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw strong reasons are required if it is to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see bedat v switzerland gc no echr ii application of those principles to the present case in the present case the court finds it appropriate to examine the abovementioned principles in the following order the content form and consequences of the publication how well known the person concerned is and the prior conduct of the person concerned the subject matter of the report and the contribution to the debate of general interest the method of obtaining the information and its veracity and the severity of the sanctions imposedα content form and consequences of the impugned article the court notes that the supreme court in its judgment of november conducted a thorough assessment of the news item concluding that when the content of the news item debated in this case is assessed as a whole and the disputed remarks are evaluated in context with other statements in the news item and in consideration of the visual presentation the comment clearly implied that a had had committed an act which was punishable in accordance with the penal code no under article of the penal code the supreme court declared the impugned words null and void thus in the assessment of the supreme court the news item for which the applicant was responsible contained accusation of a factual nature concerning unlawful and criminal acts the court sees no reason to call into question the supreme courts evaluation on this point it is also satisfied that the attack on as reputation reached the level of seriousness and that its manner caused prejudice to as enjoyment of the right to respect for private life so as to fall within the scope of article of the convention see inter alia a v norway no april in this respect it is recalled that the potential impact of the medium of expression concerned is an important factor in the consideration of the proportionality of an interference and that the audiovisual media have a more immediate and powerful effect than the print media see for example jersild v denmark judgment of september series a no β how well known the person concerned is and his conduct prior to the publication of the impugned article the district court in its judgment of november stated inter alia that a as well as the companies he represented had been in the media and public debate for many years a had also been very prominent in business in iceland and abroad both in a negative and positive light a company led by him had held an active share in one of the three major icelandic banks and news of a had therefore more often than not been about his role in the banking collapse the supreme court did not directly comment in its reasoning on as status within the context of the applicants reporting however examining the reasoning of the supreme court in its entirety the court deems it sufficiently demonstrated that the supreme court proceeded on the basis that a was to be considered a public person for the purposes of its assessment therefore the limits of acceptable criticism were accordingly wider than in the case of a private individual see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no to echr extracts with further references however the court further notes that while reporting on true facts about politicians or other public persons private life may be admissible in certain circumstances even persons known to the public have a legitimate expectation of protection of and respect for their private life see standard verlags gmb h v austria no no june γ the subject matter of the report and contribution to a debate of general interest the supreme court in its judgment of december stated inter alia the following in assessing where the line should be drawn between freedom of expression as protected by article of the constitution and the right to privacy as protected by article of the constitution it is important to determine whether the content published can be considered a part of the social debate and therefore of public interest the media play an important role in disseminating information and opinions on social issues

that occurred in the icelandic economy following the failure of the three icelandic commercial banks in the autumn of has had a significant and broad effect on all activity in the country and the general publics quality of life thus the supreme court took into account that the subject matter of the disputed news item was as such an issue of public interestδ method of obtaining the information and its veracity in its judgment the supreme court stated that the applicant had not presented any documents supporting the legitimacy of the statements for which he has to bear the burden as it was incumbent on him rather than a to secure such evidence the applicant had also not demonstrated that he had sought information from a on the content while preparing the news item he had therefore failed in his duty as outlined in article of the national broadcast services rules on news and related programming dated may to seek information from both or all parties and attempt to show their points of view as equally as possible the court concluded that the applicant could not have been acting in good faith as pertains to the accuracy of the remarks in the news item on this point the court likewise sees no reason to call into question the supreme courts conclusions it reiterates that the safeguard afforded by article to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the provision that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the ethics of journalism see for example bédat cited above furthermore the court finds that there were no special grounds in the present case to dispense the media from their ordinary obligation to verify factual statements that are defamatory of private individuals see inter alia björk eiðsdóttir v iceland no july the applicant referred to the right to protect his sources and to keep his sources and the documentation behind the news items confidential the court reiterates in this respect that protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom without which sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public concern see for example ruokanen and others v finland no april in the present case however the applicant was at no stage required to disclose the identity of his sources furthermore in the view of the court a mere reference to protection of sources can not exempt a journalist from the obligation to prove the veracity of or have sufficient factual basis for serious accusations of a factual nature an obligation that can be met without necessarily having to reveal the sources in question the court further notes that the applicant requested and received confirmation from the public prosecutor about an ongoing investigation into the loan transaction but only after the defamation case at hand had been instigated moreover this letter only confirmed that the loan transaction had been reported and was under investigation it did not state that a had been charged indicted or was on trial or had been convicted of a crime see paragraph aboveε severity of the sanction imposed the court notes that the defamation proceedings brought by a against the applicant ended in an order by the supreme court declaring the impugned words null and void and requiring the applicant to pay to a isk in compensation for nonpecuniary damage plus interest and isk for as costs before the domestic courts the court does not find the compensation excessive in the circumstances or to be of such a kind as to have a chilling effect on the exercise of media freedom see inter alia pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi with further referencesζ conclusion in the light of all the abovementioned considerations the court considers that the supreme court balanced the right of freedom of expression with the right to respect for private life and took into account the criteria set out in the courts caselaw the court recalls that although opinions may differ on the outcome of a judgment where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts case law the court would require strong reasons to substitute its own view for that of the domestic courts see paragraph above the supreme court acted within the margin of appreciation afforded to it and struck a reasonable balance between the measures imposed restricting the right to freedom of expression and the legitimate aim pursued the court therefore concludes that there has been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the

court in the same town as the publishing house on various dates the applicant unsuccessfully challenged the territorial jurisdiction of the court seeking a transfer of the case to his local court in lviv on march the city court commenced its examination of the case between march and january the city court scheduled and adjourned four hearings two of them were adjourned owing to financial constraints precluding the court from sending out correspondence in good time the third on account of the judge having a scheduling conflict and the fourth as a representative of the publishing house was absent on february the court held a hearing and admitted the district administration as a third party in the proceedings at the applicants request the court adjourned the hearing to order archive material which according to him would prove the veracity of some of his statements between february and october the court scheduled four more hearings which were adjourned as one or two parties failed to appear on october the city court held a hearing where the applicant ml and a representative of the publishing house confirmed that the applicant had received fifty copies of the book and the remaining four hundred and fifty copies had been placed at the disposal of the district administration on the same date the city court delivered its judgment it found that the disputed statements were false and defamatory and ordered the district administration to return the four hundred and fifty copies of the book in its possession to the publishing house it further obliged the latter to reprint the book at the applicants expense after having removed the disputed passage from it lastly the court awarded ml ukrainian hryvnias uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage to be paid by the applicant on october the applicant lodged a cassation appeal against this judgment he noted in particular that there was no evidence whatsoever that the disputed statements had been disseminated and that any person other than ml himself had read them he also submitted that he had personally received one hundred copies of the book which he had destroyed after the action had been lodged against him the remaining copies having been at the disposal of the district administration the book could not have been deemed disseminated ml filed an objection in which he submitted in particular that a number of officials of the district administration had read the disputed statements that some copies of the book had already been distributed to the school libraries and that the applicant himself had earlier claimed that he had distributed fifty copies of the book he also submitted letters from the head and deputy head of the district administration in which they expressed indignation with the fact that the applicant had published a gratuitous attack on mls reputation and suggested that he may have done so in revenge for mls refusal to allot a plot of land to the applicants mother on october the ivano frankivsk regional court the regional court dismissed the applicants cassation appeal and the judgment of october became final the district administration did not return its copies of the book to the publishing house according to the applicant it instead distributed a number of books to various recipients having cut out the pages which contained the disputed text on may the presidium of the regional court quashed the judgments of and october following a request by the applicant for a supervisory review протест and remitted the case to the city court for fresh examination in summer the applicant lodged a counterclaim against ml within the framework of the initial defamation proceedings he referred to a number of purported shortcomings in mls official conduct as mayor and submitted that by complaining to the authorities about the publication the mayor had simply sought to compromise the applicants reputation among his colleagues and the general public the applicant further complained that ml had published a disparaging article about him in a local newspaper and sought compensation for nonpecuniary damage and the retraction of several purportedly defamatory statements made in the article at issue this counterclaim was joined by the city court for examination together with the defamation claim brought against the applicant on september the city court transferred the case to the kosivskyy district court for examination the applicant appealed against that decision seeking a transfer of the case to his local court on october the ivano frankivsk regional court of appeal the former ivano frankivsk regional court ordered the case to be remitted to the city court having noted that that court had already started examining the case and that there were no grounds for the case to be transferred to another court on several further occasions the city court rejected requests by the applicant for the case to be transferred to his local court and for the presiding judge of the city court to be removed from the case between october and october some five hearings were adjourned on account of the applicants failure to appear on october the city court heard the case and delivered its judgment allowing mls claim in part and dismissing the applicants counterclaim the legal part of the judgment concerning mls claim stated as follows having heard the parties and having examined the materials in the case file the court considers that the claim should be allowed in part on the following grounds statements that the mayor ml an omnipotent feudal prince had brutally breached the election legislation are rebutted by the decisions of the kosivskyy district court of june and the civil division of the ivano frankivsk regional court of july from which it follows that the claimant had not breached the election law as the claim made by the group of deputies seeking an annulment of the lists of the district election committees was dismissed statements that ml had acted outrageously towards lv are rebutted by the decision of the kosmach village council of march to grant ownership of a plot of land to lv and also the statements concerning the settlement of the matter concerning restitution of the house are rebutted by the decision of the kosivskyy district court of october in respect of the claim by ol mls spouse against ys concerning the annulment of the privatisation certificate issued in yss name the court considers that the applicant arbitrarily used the aegis of the lviv institute of internal affairs in publishing the work and inserted on pages statements unsubstantiated by evidence regard being had to the liability of the applicant the gravity of the harm inflicted on the plaintiff as a public official the fact that the publication of the false statements negatively affected his image in the eyes of the district administration his acquaintances and his fellow villagers the fact that copies of the publication had been widely read by libraries schools and the district administration and the fact that fifty copies had been taken by the applicant some of them already having been disseminated and regard also being had to the time invested by the plaintiff in the judicial examination of his case the direct liability of the applicant in inflicting harm the court considers that some compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage should be awarded the city court next awarded ml uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage to be paid by the applicant and ordered that the disputed statements be retracted the relevant passage of the operative part of the judgment read as followsthe publishing house l shall publish erratum sheets додатки to the book the kosiv area antiquities retracting the statements mentioned above that do not reflect reality to be paid for by the applicant the applicant appealed he challenged in particular the courts findings that the impugned information in the book had been disseminated widely claiming that the court had not established who had disseminated his book and exactly who had read it on february the regional court upheld the findings of the city court with respect to mls claim endorsing its reasoning as relevant and sufficient at the same time the court found that no sufficient reasons had been stated for rejecting the applicants counterclaim and remitted it to the city court for fresh examination the applicant lodged a cassation appeal in which he referred to article of the convention and the provisions of national law guaranteeing freedom of speech alleging that the judgments against him were indicative of political repression and seeking to have the findings of the lower courts with respect to mls claim overturned the applicant maintained in particular that the final three sentences challenged by the mayor had been his value judgments concerning unnamed public officials and could not have been deemed defamatory to the mayor he further maintained that he could not afford to pay the damages moreover whether ml had actually suffered any damage had never been established in particular the district administration had received four hundred and fifty out of five hundred copies of the book which had been in its possession since the day the action had been lodged the district administration had later distributed some of those books to the public in breach of the court order of october requiring it to return them to the publishing house for reprinting nevertheless the disputed statements had not reached the public as employees of the district administration had cut out the controversial pages in breach of the authors copyright what had become of the other fifty copies of the book had never been established even if members of the public had obtained access to the disputed statements this could not have affected the mayors reputation in any significant way since the applicant had only recapitulated and reported information that had already been common public knowledge in support of this allegation the applicant submitted copies of numerous newspaper articles criticising the mayor and statements by individuals claiming that they had been offended by him in various ways the applicant maintained that these documents served as sufficient evidence that his statements had been true and that he could not understand how to draft a retraction of the true statements the district administration filed objections to the applicants cassation appeal it contended in particular that they had not cut out any pages from the disputed book before distributing it ml also filed objections to the applicants cassation appeal he noted in particular that the applicants allegations that the nonpecuniary damage award was disproportionate with respect to his income were speculative since he had never disclosed his income on march the city court stayed the examination of the applicants counterclaim against ml pending consideration of the cassation appeal on june the supreme court of ukraine rejected the applicants request for leave to appeal in cassation the bailiff service instituted enforcement proceedings against the applicant in the course of which he was bound to pay the judgment debt in instalments of of his main income retirement pension it appears that the debt was paid in full by june between july and april the city court adjourned some seven hearings in the case concerning the applicants counterclaim against ml either on account of the parties absence or the unavailability of recording equipment on april the ivano frankivsk regional department of education and science informed the applicant that it had received fifty copies of the book from the district administration in thirtyfive of which had been distributed to local schools others remaining in the departments library none of the copies received had pages missing the department also noted that ml acting as a private person had distributed erratum sheets to the book recepients notifying them that the statements criticising him had been deemed false and defamatory by the courts on november the city court rejected the applicants defamation claim against ml as unsubstantiated and vexatious on january the regional court upheld that judgment and on january the rivne regional court of appeal acting as a court of cassation rejected a request by the applicant for leave to appeal in cassation on april the city court rejected a claim made by the applicant against the bailiffs who had enforced the judgment of october it appears from the case file that he did not pursue that claim any further on april the city court rejected a claim made by the applicant against the publishing house for its alleged failure to comply with the judgment of october it appears from the case file that the applicant did not pursue that claim any further either in may the applicant instituted proceedings against ml in the city court he claimed in particular that he had unlawfully published a pseudoretraction of the applicants statements found defamatory which resulted in the breach of the applicants copyright and denigration of his dignity it appears that the proceedings are currently pending ii relevant domestic lawa constitution of ukraine relevant extracts from the constitution of ukraine read as

of disseminated statements that do not reflect reality and cause damage to their interests honour dignity or professional reputation shall be entitled to demand in addition to the retraction of such statements compensation for the pecuniary and moral nonpecuniary damage caused by their dissemination the lawi alleged violations of article of the convention the applicant complained that the proceedings involving mls defamation claim and his counterclaim had been inordinately lengthy and that his right to a fair hearing had been breached as the courts had failed to respond to his arguments and state adequate reasons for their findings in the judgments given in mls defamation claim he referred to article of the convention which insofar as relevant reads as follows in the determination of his civil rights and obligations everyone is entitled to a fair hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law the government did not submit any objections concerning the admissibility of the above complaints in addition to the above complaints the applicant lodged numerous other complaints under article of the convention alleging that his right to a fair trial had not been respected a admissibility the court finds that the applicants complaints concerning the length of the proceedings and alleged failure of the domestic courts to state adequate reasons for their decisions taken in the defamation proceedings are not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds they must therefore be declared admissible as regards the remainder of the complaints mentioned in paragraph above having considered them in the light of all the material in its possession the court finds that in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the convention and must be declared inadmissible as being manifestly illfounded pursuant to article a and of the convention b merits alleged violation of article of the convention on account of the length of the proceedingsa the period to be taken into account the applicant viewed the proceedings at issue in the present case as one set which had started when ml had lodged a defamation claim against him and had ended when the final judgment had been taken in respect of his counterclaim the government viewed the proceedings at issue as two sets whose length had to be assessed separately in the courts view regard being had in particular to the manner in which the domestic courts treated the proceedings at issue see paragraphs and above it is feasible to assess the overall length of the proceedings concerning the determination of mls defamation claim and the applicants counterclaim against him in their entirety accordingly the court notes that the proceedings lasted from april when mls claim was lodged with the kosivskyy district court until january when the final decision was taken in respect of the applicants counter claim it follows that the proceedings lasted nine years and nearly nine monthsb reasonableness of the length of the proceedings the applicant submitted that the proceedings in his case had been delayed on account of the improper approach of the judicial authorities in performing their professional duties the government contested this view the court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria the complexity of the case the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute see among many other authorities frydlender v france gc no echr vii the court notes that as can be seen from the material before it some delays in the proceedings in the present case were caused by the applicants conduct in particular his repeated failures to appear for the hearings at the same time a number of other delays were caused by other factors including adjournments of hearings on account of other parties absences and various scheduling issues remittals of the case for reconsideration and extended periods of judicial inactivity in addition the proceedings were also delayed on account of the nonenforcement and eventual quashing of the final judgment of october the court has frequently found violations in cases raising issues similar to those in the present case see for example pavlyulynets v ukraine no september golovko v ukraine no february and chukhas v ukraine no july having examined all the material submitted to it the court considers that the government have not put forward any facts or arguments capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case having regard to its caselaw on the subject it considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the reasonable time requirement there has accordingly been a breach of article in this respect alleged violation of article of the convention on account of the purported inadequacy of the reasoning in the courts decisions the applicant submitted that the domestic courts had failed to provide sufficient reasoning for their factual findings and had reached arbitrary conclusions in the defamation proceedings against him first of all they had failed to substantiate their finding that the statements found to be defamatory had actually been disseminated as it had never been established who had distributed the disputed text when and how it had been done or what the circle of its actual readership had been second the courts had ignored that the district administration had been in control of most of the copies of the book before the defamation proceedings had been instituted and that the applicants role in the dissemination of the text if any had been negligible at most finally in assessing the damage purportedly caused to the plaintiff the domestic judicial authorities had arbitrarily disregarded numerous materials such as newspaper articles criticizing ml and declarations signed by people who had purportedly suffered injustice because of him showing that the disputed statements did not emanate from the applicant and that he had merely compiled information which had already been circulated widely the government contested the applicants submissions and maintained that he had benefitted from all the guarantees of a fair trial by independent and impartial courts which had properly assessed the factual evidence before them and given sufficient reasons for their decisions in particular the applicants allegations that he could not be held liable for the dissemination of the disputed statements had been at odds with his own submissions made to the city court on october according to which he had obtained and distributed fifty copies of the book his later allegation that he had destroyed one hundred copies of the book which contradicted his earlier statements and other evidence on file showed that he had been acting in bad faith and had tried to mislead the court the civil courts not having an investigative function had based their conclusions on the evidence provided by the parties which in the circumstances of the present case was sufficient for making the relevant conclusions the court reiterates that article obliges the courts to give reasons for their judgments but can not be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument see van de hurk v the netherlands april series a no this obligation is an essential procedural safeguard under article of the convention as it demonstrates to the parties that their arguments have been heard affords them the possibility of objecting to or appealing against the decision and also serves to justify the reasons for a judicial decision to the public see eg suominen v finland no july and boldea v romania no february the principle of fairness enshrined in article of the convention would be disturbed where domestic courts ignore a specific pertinent and important point made by an applicant see eg pronina v ukraine no july and mala v ukraine no july otherwise it is in the first place for the national courts to interpret domestic law and the court will not substitute its own interpretation for theirs in the absence of arbitrariness see eg mala cited above turning to the facts of the present case the court notes the scarcity of the reasoning provided in the city courts judgment of october in support of some of its conclusions most of the courts reasoning is dedicated to substantiating a conclusion that the factual allegations against the plaintiff were false other conclusions such as that the book had been widely read or that the plaintiffs reputation had suffered damage warranting the payment of compensation are couched in rather formulaic terms without any further explanation as to why the court made such findings and on which evidence they were based the judgments taken by the appellate court and the court of cassation endorsed the above reasoning as sufficient without responding expressly to the applicants argument concerning the role of the district administration in the distribution of the books and a number of his other submissions on the other hand the court does not find any basis on which to conclude that the overall factual findings of the domestic courts in the case at issue were manifestly arbitrary or that the scarcity of the reasoning provided extinguished the very essence of the applicants procedural rights under article see thoma v luxembourg no dec may and contrast boldea cited above in particular it is clear from the case file that the applicant authored the disputed article with a direct purpose for it to reach the public and that his text was printed in a book and became known to persons other than the plaintiff it is also notable that the disputed text phrased as a recital of the applicants own convictions and without any references to external sources was intended to leave the reader with a clear impression that the plaintiff had been involved in corrupt and unfair dealings incompatible with his public office the court finds that this message was as such inherently damaging to the plaintiffs reputation and accepts that once the book in which it was published entered public domain it was a daunting task to establish the circle of its actual and potential readership or to quantify the real impact this message would have on them over the period of its circulation in this connection the court can also not accept the applicants assertion that the readers would have necessarily been aware of the factual background of the views he had sought to convey overall there is nothing in the case file to warrant a finding that a more detailed analysis of the actual scope of dissemination of the disputed passage or its actual impact on the diminishment of the plaintiffs prestige could have materially affected the general conclusions reached by the domestic courts as to whether or not the defamation offence had taken place in so far as the applicant complained that the domestic courts had failed to address his arguments concerning the important role of the district administration in distributing the books the court recalls that the district administration was not a respondent in the proceedings at issue and that the question of its liability was therefore outside their scope in the courts view an assessment of the district administrations role could have been of importance in the applicants defamation proceedings had there been a question of excluding his own responsibility in view of this role however the applicant being the author of the disputed text published with his consent in a book intended for distribution to the public the court finds no arbitrariness in the fact that his responsibility in its dissemination was found to be engaged regardless of how many books he had personally distributed to the end readers based on the materials at hand the court can not speculate either as to whether the role of the district administration was accounted for in the determination of the amount of damages levied against the applicant particularly as the applicant himself failed to provide a clear and consistent information concerning his own role in the actual distribution of the book see paragraphs and and above in view of the above considerations the court concludes that the applicant failed to show that the domestic judicial authorities had ignored a specific pertinent and important point made by him in context of the proceedings at issue in these circumstances it is not for the court to take upon itself the role of a linguistic corrector or to secondguess the domestic courts judgment involving the use of subjective and unquantifiable categories such as that the publication had been widely read or negatively affected the plaintiffs image accordingly the court does not find that in the circumstances of the present case the very fact that the domestic courts did not elaborate in more detail on the reasoning for their judgments and did not expressly respond to some of the applicants arguments resulted in his rights guaranteed by article being extinguished the court therefore finds that there has been no violation of article of the convention in this respect ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the state authorities had arbitrarily and unfairly interfered with his freedom to criticise the conduct of a public official the applicant relied on article of the convention which in so far as relevant reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the government did not submit any comments concerning the admissibility of this complaint the court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention and that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissionsa the applicant the applicant submitted that there was no pressing social need for restricting his expression in the present case comparing his case to that of lingens v austria july series a no he submitted that his publication constituted a legitimate value judgment concerning misconduct of a public official based on information which had already been common public knowledge the judicial authorities had failed to recognise his text as an expression of a value judgment and had disregarded the evidence presented by him in support of the truthfulness of the underlying factual allegations the applicant further submitted that the interference was also disproportionate in particular he had been made to pay a sum which had no connection to the damage purportedly suffered by the plaintiff or to the applicants personal role in the dissemination of the disputed text and which had been onerous on his family budget furthermore the vagueness of the language used in the judgment ordering the statements to be retracted had prevented him from executing the order and had resulted in ml publishing an erratum sheet at his own instigation in which he had accused the applicant of lying and undermined his credibility as an academic researcher lastly the overall manner in which the state authorities had approached the applicants case had been unlawful corrupt unfair and humiliating in particular the district administration had failed to execute the court judgment of october and had been distributing copies of the book as it saw fit with pages cut out while the proceedings had been pending the conduct of the authorities had a chilling effect on the applicants research as it kept him in a state of continuous uncertainty as to the fate of his publication and had resulted in a situation where the muchawaited research of which he was a coauthor had not achieved the publicity and social acclaim it deservedb the government the government submitted that the finding against the applicant in the defamation proceedings constituted a legitimate restriction of his rights guaranteed by article of the convention in particular it pursued a legitimate aim namely the protection of mls reputation and had been based on provisions of the domestic law which were accessible and foreseeable they submitted that the interference was also necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to the aim pursued in particular the domestic caselaw at the material time had been wellequipped to differentiate between value judgments and statements of fact the applicant in the present case had been held liable not for expressing a value judgment but for having made false factual allegations accusing ml of serious misconduct he himself had treated those allegations as factual in both the domestic and the convention proceedings in his case and had sought to have documentary and other evidence examined in support of his position the domestic courts had thoroughly examined the evidence presented by both parties and had dismissed the applicants arguments as speculative and unsubstantiated in their reasoned judgments the applicant had enjoyed the benefits of a fair procedure his arguments had been examined by independent and impartial courts at three levels of jurisdiction the judicial authorities had enabled him to present evidence in support of his position and had stated relevant and sufficient reasons for their findings lastly in so far as the applicant complained that the district administration had acted unlawfully in particular by failing to return the books to the publisher or distributing them contrary to his volition he had not duly raised these complaints before the domestic authorities the courts assessment the court notes that the finding against the applicant in the defamation proceedings constituted an interference with his rights guaranteed under article of the convention see myrskyy v ukraine no may it further agrees that this interference in the present case was in accordance with the law see ukrainian media group v ukraine no march and gazeta ukraina tsentr v ukraine no july and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting mls reputation it remains therefore to be determined whether this interference was also necessary in a democratic society in this connection the court reiterates that the test of necessity requires it to determine whether the interference corresponded to a pressing social need whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient see among many other authorities cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no and echr xi the courts task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the competent domestic courts but rather to review whether the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and whether in this context they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see among other authorities fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i and ringier axel springer slovakia a s v slovakia no and july the court must also ascertain whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance between on the one hand the protection of freedom of expression as enshrined in article and on the other the protection of the reputation of those against whom allegations have been made a right which as an aspect of private life is protected by article of the convention see among other authorities chauvy and others v france no in fine echr vi and couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no november in addition the fairness of the proceedings the procedural guarantees afforded and the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference see kwiecień v poland no january turning to the facts of the present case the court finds that they are materially different from those examined in the lingens case cited by the applicant in support of his complaint that case concerned the freedom of a journalist to criticise a leading politician at the national level in a periodical featuring discussion on current affairs whereas the present case concerns an academic criticizing the performance of a contemporary local official in an otherwise uncontroversial book presenting archaeological and historical research the court agrees that the subject of the applicants communication as such related to a legitimate matter of public concern nevertheless it fails to see the pertinence of the forum chosen by the applicant for expressing his critical views and does not consider that the context in which they were published warranted the application of the same high tolerance standard appropriate for media cases such as lingens cited above or for other cases involving expression in the context of pluralistic debate and exchange of opinions on matters of serious public concern see andrushko v russia no and october and steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii the court next notes that in the lingens case the applicant was penalised for disseminating critical value judgments not susceptible of proof whereas in the present case the core of the defamation action against the applicant concerned the accuracy of three specific factual allegations that the mayor had breached election legislation to obtain favourable election results that he had arranged for a disabled citizen to be deprived of a plot of land in favour of his personal acquaintance and that his family had corruptly acquired a house the court notes that these accusations phrased as direct allegations of potentially criminal misconduct were quite serious it further reiterates that where allegations are made about the conduct of a third party it may sometimes be difficult to distinguish between assertions of fact and value judgments see cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre cited above nevertheless even a value judgment may be excessive if it has no factual basis to support it ibid accordingly the court finds no issue with the fact that the domestic courts required the applicant to substantiate the factual allegations underlying the views he expressed which in the absence of sufficient proof could be regarded as defamatory it is also notable that the applicant himself treated the above factual allegations as true in his submissions to the domestic judicial authorities and to the court and presented various documents which in his view showed that his statements were accurate while some sentences of the disputed text namely the first sentence where mls conduct was compared to that of a feudal prince and the final sentences where the applicant expressed a general opinion about corrupt officials clearly constituted value judgments the court finds that they were so deeply intertwined with the overall factual message that the very fact that the domestic courts had not addressed them separately in their judgments does not of itself raise an issue in the present case the court next observes that it has not been argued in the present case that the applicant was precluded from submitting any evidence he deemed necessary in support of the veracity of the challenged factual statements in the domestic proceedings compare and contrast with andrushko v russia no october or more generally that the courts made their decisions without analysing some material important for contextual assessment of the applicants publication compare and contrast with ringier axel springer slovakia as v slovakia no no and january on the contrary it appears that the city court honoured the applicants efforts to provide complete information for instance by adjourning a hearing at his request with a view to ordering pertinent archive material see paragraph above the court next observes that in finding that the applicant had insufficient sources to substantiate the sweeping and disparaging conclusions he had made concerning mls character the city court cited a number of sources including official documents among them a court judgment in which an allegation of election fraud by ml had already been dismissed see paragraph above from the material before it the court does not consider that the domestic courts took an arbitrary decision or overstepped their margin of appreciation in finding that the applicant had insufficiently substantiated his factual conclusions and that his statements concerning mls misconduct had accordingly been defamatory in so far as the applicant submitted that the interference with his rights did not correspond to a pressing social need as the disputed statements had in fact not been disseminated at the time the defamation action had been lodged and that he should not have been held liable for any subsequent dissemination the court has already dismissed similar arguments when examining his complaint under article of the convention see paragraphs above in view of all the above the court concludes that the domestic courts provided relevant and sufficient reasons justifying a conclusion that interference with the applicants rights under article corresponded to a pressing social need as regards the proportionality of this interference the court recalls that the applicant was ordered to cover the costs of publishing an erratum sheet to the book containing a retraction of the statements found to be defamatory and to pay ml uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage in so far as the applicant complained that he had been obliged to cover the costs of publishing a retraction by a court order so vague and overbroad that it had been practically impossible to enforce it the court does not find that regard being had to the margin of appreciation afforded to the national courts the order to retract defamatory statements was as such disproportionate in the present case particularly given the nature of the publication which did not afford ml any alternative forum for addressing its readers it further recalls that it is not evident that the applicant did or is likely to suffer any adverse consequences for not having paid for the publication of the retraction to date while he complained that the district administration had failed to return the books to the publishing house and that ml had published at his own expense a humiliating pseudoretraction the court does not see any direct causal connection between these events and the wording of the disputed court order in view of the above the court considers that the applicants complaint concerning the court order to pay for publishing of a retraction is not substantiated neither does the court find that the amount of compensation levied against the applicant uah was as such excessive despite complaining that the amount had a disproportionate impact on his family budget the applicant did not disclose details of it either in the domestic or in the convention proceedings it is also noteworthy that he in fact paid his judgment debt in monthly instalments amounting to of his retirement pension over an extended period of time in the absence of any more detailed information as to how this payment affected the applicants everyday life the court can not conclude that he suffered an excessive and disproportionate financial burden the court is mindful that as noted above the domestic courts omitted responding directly to the applicants arguments concerning his allegedly unimportant personal role in distributing the books and lack of evidence that the plaintiffs prestige had in fact diminished as a result of his publication moreover none of the judgments given by the domestic courts in the applicants case included express language indicating that they had acknowledged the existence of the conflicting rights to reputation and freedom of expression in the case at issue which required striking a fair balance between them see eg aksu v turkey gc nos and echr in this connection the court would reiterate the importance of an obligation to provide reasons for decisions concerning a restriction of the right to freedom of expression which offers an important procedural safeguard against arbitrary interferences with this right see mutatis mutandis boldea cited above nur radyo ve televizyon yayıncılığı aş v turkey no no october cumhuriyet vakfı and others v turkey no october and ringier axel springer slovakia as v slovakia no no january however in the particular circumstances of the present case having established that the substantive conclusions reached by the domestic courts concerning the defamatory nature of the statements submitted by the applicant for publication had not been arbitrary and the penalties imposed on him had not been excessive the court finds that the absence of a more detailed reasoning for the above conclusions alone can not justify a finding that the interference was not necessary in view of the above the court considers that it is not necessary to examine other arguments adduced by the applicant and finds that there has been no violation of article of the convention in the present case iii other alleged violations of the convention the applicant also complained under article of protocol to the convention that his rights during the enforcement of the judgment against him had been breached and that the district administration had acted unlawfully in taking the books from the publishing house not returning them in accordance with the court order of october and distributing them as they saw fit having cut out the pages containing the disputed statements in addition he complained under article of the convention that he had had no effective remedies to complain about various elements of purported procedural unfairness in the proceedings to which he was a party and the allegedly unlawful conduct of various authorities and cited article of the convention with respect to the facts of the present case having considered these complaints in the light of all the material in its possession the court finds that in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the convention it follows that this part of the application must be declared inadmissible as being manifestly illfounded pursuant to article a and of the convention iv application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court finds that there has been a violation of the convention or the protocols thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party the applicant did not submit a claim for just satisfaction within the timelimit allotted to him for that purpose accordingly the court considers that there is no call to award him any sum on that account for these reasons the court unanimously declares the complaints concerning the excessive length of the proceedings inadequate reasoning of the court judgments and restriction of the applicants freedom of expression

instituted any civil action against the applicant the museums audits in a series of management and tax audits were carried out by various public institutions at the museum the domestic courts established that at least one audit that undertaken by the supreme audit office had been carried out of its own initiative they further established that the audit undertaken by the ministry of culture had been carried out in relation to the applicants letters the contents of the postaudit reports are unknown to the court the applicant submitted that the supreme audit office had confirmed that the storage and the public display of the museums artefacts had been marked by irregularities the domestic court established during the criminal proceedings described below that the said audits had not revealed any shortcomings in the running of the museum the preliminary criminal inquiry that had been opened following the audits had ultimately been discontinued the domestic court also established that the audits had temporarily disturbed the work of the museum moreover in the museum had received less funding from public sources than in the previous years the applicant contested that finding in his appeal to the domestic court see paragraph below criminal proceedings against the applicant on september the museum filed a private bill of indictment against the applicant accusing him of disseminating between december and july untrue information about the activities of the museums management the case was registered with the warsaw district court which held ten hearings on july the warsaw district court convicted the applicant of libel of the museum and its management on account of the applicants sending four anonymous letters on november to the tax office the supreme audit office and the regional prosecutor and on march to the president of polands office that contained defamatory statements and by doing so putting the museum at risk of losing the public trust necessary for its social cultural and educational activities the court imposed on the applicant a fine grzywna in the amount of polish zlotys pln approximately euros eur the applicant was also ordered to bear various costs of the proceedings in the total amount of pln approximately eur the warsaw district court considered it established that the envelopes that had contained the impugned letters bore handwriting which without any doubt was that of the applicant the warsaw district court based its findings of fact as described above on the testimony of five witnesses including the museums director two reports issued by a courtappointed expert in the forensic examination of documents a copy of the warsaw district prosecutors decision declining to open a criminal investigation the postaudit report of the supreme audit office a copy of the warsaw district courts judgment of november delivered in the applicants related case no iv w a psychiatric report letters from the presidents office the tax office and minister of culture and science original typed letters which had been sent to the abovementioned relevant institutions together with handaddressed envelopes various reports concerning the museum and the postaudit report of the ministry of culture and various other pieces of evidence before the warsaw district court the applicant stated that he had not written or sent the impugned letters he also argued that the case had been mounted against him in revenge for his unbiased work as a courtappointed expert in a certain highprofile case concerning another museum the applicant stated that pś had attempted to pressure him into drafting a report which would be favourable to the director of that museum who was pśs friend when the applicant refused attempts were made to have him discredited the applicant was accused of stealing an exhibit and of libelling the museum and ultimately his employment contract was terminated with three months notice the applicant recalled instances when in his opinion pś had placed himself in a situation in which he had faced a conflict of interests or had disregarded the applicants warning that exhibits had been inappropriately handled on the other hand he said that he had not had access to the financial documents of the museum and he did not know of incidents involving mismanagement irregularities in accounting bullying or inappropriate activity on the part of other employees the court which heard pś and other witnesses in respect of the above allegations made by the applicant found that the museums director had not been biased against the applicant furthermore the warsaw district court found that the impugned libel did not concern pś as a private person but rather the museum as an institution and its management for the court denunciations of a wrongful conduct should rely on facts and not only on bare value judgments of the person making such denunciations defamation could take the form of the accusation of a specific factual conduct or of the voicing of a general opinion about the actions or the features of an injured party on the facts the warsaw district court found that the applicants statements contained untrue allegations which had shed a bad light on the museum and its director irrespective of whether the applicants statements had resulted in the audits or had had any other negative consequences for the museum they had clearly put the museum at risk of losing its good reputation the applicant had not acted in good faith that is to say in defence of the museums interests he had acted with direct intent to damage the reputation of the museum and its management by making allegations which had not been objectively confirmed having worked long years at the museum the applicant had been perfectly aware of the untrue nature of his statements as for the fine the warsaw district court observed that it was proportionate on the one hand to the harm caused by the applicants actions and on the other hand to the applicants income to that end the court established that the applicant made pln per month and had no dependent persons the applicant appealed arguing that the firstinstance court had erred in finding him to be the author of the letters in question and that by convicting him it had violated his human rights on january the warsaw regional court sąd okręgowy upheld that judgment the judgment was served on the applicants lawyer on april on an unspecified date the prosecutor general declined to grant the applicants request and to lodge a cassation appeal as in his view there were no grounds for it civil proceedings against the applicant according to the applicant in the museum had also brought a civil claim against him seeking compensation for defamation the applicant further submitted that a civil court which was bound by the findings of the criminal court in the proceedings against him partly allowed that claim and ordered the applicant to pay approximately pln eur in compensation and court fees relevant legal framework article of the criminal code provides as follows anyone who imputes to another person a group of persons an institution a legal person or an organisation without legal personality such behaviour or characteristics as may lower the standing of such a person group or entity in the publics opinion or undermine public confidence in their necessary capacity to undertake a certain position occupation or type of activity shall be liable to a fine restriction on their liberty or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year if the perpetrator commits the act described in paragraph through the means of mass communication he shall be liable to a fine restriction of liberty or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years when imposing sentence for an offence specified in paragraphs or a court may award a supplementary payment to the injured person or the polish red cross or for another social purpose designated by the injured person nawiązka the prosecution of an offence specified in paragraphs or may occur upon a private charge being brought the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that his criminal conviction constituted a disproportionate and unjustified sanction because criticising the professional activities of someone such as the museums director who was a public figure had to be tolerated in a democratic society article of the convention reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility submissions by the partiesa the government the government raised the following preliminary objections they argued that the application was incompatible with article of the convention because firstly the applicant denied being the author of the impugned statements and secondly the statements were false and had been aimed at damaging the reputation of the museum in the governments view the applicant had wanted to deflect article from its real purpose by using freedom of expression for private ends namely libelling and defaming persons with whom he had been in personal conflict the applicant had therefore abused the protection afforded to freedom of expression contrary to article of the convention the application was thus incompatible ratione materiae within the meaning of article a of the convention relying on the same two arguments as those detailed above the government also argued that the application should be declared inadmissible for abuse of the right of individual application within the meaning of article a of the convention they stressed that by signing the letters as the staff of the museum the applicant had tried to mislead the domestic courts and had put third parties at risk by falsely implying that they had been responsible for the impugned contentb the applicant the applicant submitted that despite denying being the author of the letters in question he enjoyed the protection of article of the convention because a domestic court had convicted him of libel having considered him to be the author article was therefore applicable in the present case moreover the application should not be declared inadmissible for abuse of the right of individual application the mere fact that the applicant disagreed with certain versions of facts of the case as presented by the domestic court or by the government did not mean that he had tried to mislead the court the courts assessmenta as to the objection alleging incompatibility with article on the basis of the fact that the applicant denies having voiced the expressions for which he was convicted the court has already held in some specific situations that the applicants who deny imparting any ideas or information within the meaning of article of the convention may nevertheless enjoy the protection of that provision to that end in the case of müdür duman v turkey in which the applicant was convicted of a serious offence of praising and condoning an act punishable by law on the basis of material found in the office of his political party the court observed that not accepting that the applicants criminal conviction constituted an interference on the grounds that he had denied any involvement in the actions at issue would be tantamount to requiring the applicant to acknowledge the acts of which he had stood accused and would lock him in a vicious circle that would deprive him of the protection of the convention see müdür duman v turkey no october in addition requiring that the applicant acknowledges the acts for which he stood accused would run counter to the right not to incriminate oneself which is part of international fair trial standards although not expressly mentioned in article of the convention ibid in the similar vein in the case of stojanović v croatia in which the applicant while not denying having given an interview argued that he had never used the particular words giving rise to his civil defamation case the court observed that in attributing the impugned statements to the applicant and ordering him to pay damages in respect of those statements the domestic courts had indirectly stifled the exercise of his freedom of expression the court held that article of the convention was applicable because if the applicants argument proved to be correct the damages he had been ordered to pay would have been likely to discourage him from making criticisms of that kind in future see stojanović v croatia no september the court observes that in the present case the applicants criminal conviction for defamation was indisputably directed at activities falling within the scope of freedom of expression as noted above and that the applicant was sanctioned for engaging in such activities despite his denial of the authorship of the letters in question the court considers that in such circumstances the applicants conviction must similarly to the abovementioned cases of müdür duman and stojanović be regarded as constituting an interference with his exercise of his right to freedom of expressionb as to the objection that the applicant had abused the protection of freedom of expression contrary to article of the convention the court will now examine the governments objection that the views expressed by the applicant ran counter to the text and spirit of the convention and that he therefore could not under article of the convention rely on article as regards his impugned statements the court has found that any remark directed against the conventions underlying values is removed from the protection of article by article see mbala mbala v france dec no echr extracts article is only applicable on an exceptional basis and in extreme cases and should in cases concerning article of the convention only be resorted to if it is immediately clear that the impugned statements sought to deflect this article from its real purpose by employing the right to freedom of expression for ends clearly contrary to the values of the convention see perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extracts the decisive point when assessing whether statements are removed from the protection of article by article is whether those statements are directed against the conventions underlying values for example by stirring up hatred or violence or whether by making the statement the author attempted to rely on the convention to engage in an activity or perform acts aimed at the destruction of the rights and freedoms laid down in it pastörs v germany no october in the case at hand the applicant was convicted of making allegations about the mismanagement of public funds labour law infringements and various flaws in the organisation of a public museum of which the applicant was an employee and its director although the manner in which the applicant acted may be considered objectionable in light of the courts caselaw as referred to above the content of the impugned remarks does not justify the application of article of the convention in view of the above the court finds that the applicant can not be deprived of the protection of article of the convention by article of the conventionc as to the objection that the applicant had abused of the right of individual application within the meaning of article a of the convention it remains for the court to examine the governments objection that the applicant had abused the right of individual application because by denying being the author of the letters and by making false statements about the museum he had tried to mislead the domestic courts and this court the court reiterates that an application may be rejected as abusive if among other reasons it was knowingly based on untrue facts see gross v switzerland gc no echr with further references and pytel v poland no august with further references incomplete and therefore misleading information may also amount to abuse of the right of application especially if the information concerns the very core of the case and no sufficient explanation is given for the failure to disclose that information see gross cited above bestry v poland dec no november and hüttner v germany dec no june in principle any conduct on the part of an applicant that is manifestly contrary to the purpose of the right of individual application as provided for in the convention and which impedes the proper functioning of the court or the proper conduct of the proceedings before it can be considered as an abuse of the right of application see chim and przywieczerski v poland no april and miroļubovs and others v latvia no september the applicants intention to mislead the court must always be established with sufficient certainty see gross cited above with further references in the present case the applicant while making his article complaint denied that he was the author of written statements for which he had been convicted by the domestic court that in fact was his line of defence before the criminal court in the light of its considerations in the case of müdür duman cited above see paragraph above the court finds that the fact that the domestic court ultimately found on the basis of evidence that the applicant was in fact the author of the statements in question does not preclude the applicant from reiterating his original position before this court in any event for reasons which the court has already stated in paragraph above the core issue in the present case is not whether the domestic court had erred in finding the applicant responsible for the impugned statements but rather whether assuming that he was the author the imposition of a criminal sanction on him for the offence of defamation was justified under paragraph of article of the convention the court concludes from the above that there is no basis for finding that the applicant submitted untrue information concerning the very core of the case with the intention of misleading the court and thereby abused his right of individual petition the court further notes that the application is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merits submissions by the partiesa the applicant the applicant argued that the interference in his case had been unlawful in that article of the criminal code which had been the basis of his conviction for libel had reversed the burden of proof placing it on the defendant it thus required the applicant to prove that the person who had written the impugned letters had done so legitimately because his or her accusations were true the applicant not being the author of the statements in question had had no knowledge about their alleged false character moreover the applicant submitted that his application ought to be examined within the context of a whistleblowers freedom to impart information the interference in his case had thus been unjustified and disproportionate within the meaning of paragraph of article of the convention to that end the applicant made the following observations the author of the letters in question had not acted out of any personal motivation or gain but in the public interest namely in order to ensure the lawful and rational management of public funds a respectful work environment and the preservation of the national heritage in the case of the museum those interests had in the authors view been threatened by corruption work harassment the embezzlement of public funds and the mishandling of exhibits the author of the letters had denounced the shortcomings that as to his or her best knowledge had taken place at the museum in the absence of legislation concerning whistleblowers at the material time the person in question had not had any alternative channels of bringing his or her suspicions to the attention of the authorities concerned in the applicants opinion it would have been pointless to bring the issue to the attention of the museums director as the allegations had been made against that very person furthermore the applicant claimed that the author of the letters had had reasonable grounds for fearing that the evidence would have been concealed or destroyed if he or she had first reported the issue to the museums management in the present case therefore it had clearly been impracticable for the person making the impugned statements to inform his or her superiors of the suspicions still the author had chosen not to inform the public but had rather reported the alleged wrongdoings to the appropriate bodies that had had authority to examine the case the applicant also submitted that it would have been unreasonable to expect that citizens who otherwise were under a statutory duty to denounce wrongful acts to prosecutors under article of the code of criminal procedure should only report situations which they were absolutely sure of and for which they had evidence after all it was up to the police or other public authorities to investigate the matters brought to their attention one should therefore not be prosecuted for denouncing a wrongful act in good faith such approach would have a chilling effect on the colleagues of such a whistleblower the applicant also argued that in any event in the light of the results of the audit that had been carried out at the museum the statements made in the impugned letters might well have been considered true the applicant furthermore submitted that the domestic court had committed an error of fact as the applicant had not been the author of the letters the domestic courts had also failed to examine the applicants case from the perspective of the protection of a whistleblower they had also disregarded several important elements of the case namely the fact that i the impugned statements had been made in sealed anonymous letters the content of which had never been made public and ii the statements concerned a public institution and its director thus a public official who did not enjoy the same degree of protection of his private life or of his reputation as would a private person on that latter point the applicant submitted that the museum as a legal person and a public entity could not rely on the considerations of the right to respect for private life guaranteed by article of the convention that right was after all inherently attributable to victims who were private and physical persons it followed that in the applicants opinion the present application was not about the balancing of two rights that were equally protected by the convention lastly the applicant argued that the sanction that had been imposed on him had been completely disproportionate bearing in mind the fact that he had also been dismissed from work and ordered to compensate the museum in civil proceedings see paragraphs and above the applicant also stressed that his conviction had deprived him of the possibility to work in his chosen profession elsewhereb the government the government argued that the interference in question had been justified under paragraph of article of the convention in particular the applicants statements had been anonymous and untrue and as such they could therefore not have gained the protection guaranteed to a whistleblower moreover the applicant had not wished to protect any common good rather he had acted with the sole aim of hurting his employers reputation the allegations that he had made had attained the requisite level of seriousness and could well have infringed on pś article rights the national authorities had therefore struck a fair balance between two equally important convention rights that of the applicants freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the convention and that of protecting the reputation of the museum and its director as recognised by article of the convention the domestic courts in adjudicating the applicants case had thoroughly analysed the abovementioned conflict of interests against the facts of the case those facts had been established on the basis of reliable and exhaustive evidence the sanction imposed on the applicant at the conclusion of the impugned criminal proceedings had been proportionate to the nature and the severity of his prohibited conduct and its consequences on the other hand in determining the level of the fine the domestic courts had well taken into consideration the applicants financial situation the courts assessmenta general principles the general principles regarding an assessment of whether an interference with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression was necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention are wellsettled in the courts caselaw they were restated in pentikäinen v finland gc no echr bédat v switzerland gc no march and summarised in perinçek cited above in addition it is to be reiterated that the court must ascertain whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance between the protection of freedom of expression as enshrined in article and the protection of the reputation of those against whom allegations have been made a right which as an aspect of private life is protected by article of the convention the relevant criteria that the court relies on to balance the right to freedom of expression against the right to respect for private life were recapitulated in perinçek cited above in particular the court reiterates that reputation is protected by article of the convention as part of the right to respect for private life see von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr axel springer ag v germany gc no february couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no echr extracts and perinçek cited above in order to fulfil its positive obligation to safeguard one persons rights under article the state may have to restrict to some extent the rights secured under article for another person when examining the necessity of that restriction in a democratic society in the interests of the protection of the reputation or rights of others the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases namely on the one hand freedom of expression as protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life as enshrined in article see bédat cited above in cases which require the right to respect for private life to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression the court has held that the outcome of the application in question should not in principle vary according to whether it has been lodged with the court under article of the convention by the person who was the subject of the statements in question or under article by the statements author these rights deserve equal respect accordingly the margin of appreciation should in principle be the same in both situations see satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june moreover in such cases the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see von hannover cited above when it comes to the protection of the reputation of others the court has made a distinction between defamation of natural and legal persons the court has nevertheless left open the question of whether the private life aspect of article protects the reputation of a company see firma edv für sie ef s elektronische datenverarbeitung dienstleistungs gmb h v germany dec no september on the other hand within the context of article the court has considered that the protection of a universitys authority was a mere institutional interest which did not necessarily have the same strength as the protection of the reputation or rights of others within the meaning of article of the convention see kharlamov v russia no october on another occasion the court has acknowledged that a company has a right to defend itself against defamatory allegations and that a general interest exists in protecting companies commercial viability and the wider economic good by limiting the damage caused by allegations which risked harming a companys reputation see uj v hungary no july in spite of that the court still sees a difference between the commercial reputational interests of a company and the reputation of an individual concerning his or her social status whereas the latter might have repercussions visàvis a persons dignity for the court interests in respect of commercial reputation are devoid of that moral dimension ibid as the court has affirmed with regards to the need to perform a balancing exercise between the right to reputation of a public institution with executive powers and freedom of expression limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to a public authority than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician in a democratic system the actions or omissions of a body vested with executive powers must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion see mutatis mutandis şener v turkey no july lombardo and others v malta no april and margulev v russia no october the court has also distinguished between assertions of facts and value judgments while the existence of facts can be demonstrated the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof at the same time where allegations are made about the conduct of a third party it may sometimes be difficult to distinguish between assertions of fact and value judgments see mutatis mutandis pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi in case of assertion of facts relying on the presumption of falsity and thus asking the author to demonstrate the truth of his or her assertions as required under the applicable criminal provisions does not necessarily contravene the convention see mutatis mutandis kasabova v bulgaria no april rumyana ivanova v bulgaria no and february makarenko v russia no december and rukaj v greece dec no january however an applicant clearly involved in a public debate on an important issue is required to meet a no more demanding standard than that of due diligence as in such circumstances an obligation to prove the factual statements may deprive him or her of the protection afforded by article see mutatis mutandis monica macovei v romania no july with further references at the same time where an utterance amounts to a value judgment the proportionality of the interference may depend on whether or not there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement since even a value judgment may be excessive if it has no factual basis to support it the more serious such an allegation is the more solid the factual basis has to be see de haes and gijsels v belgium february reports of judgments and decisions i and lewandowska malec v poland no and september b application of these principles to the casei whether there was an interference as the court has already stated above the applicants criminal conviction for libel constituted an interference with his exercise of his right to freedom of expression see paragraph aboveii whether the interference was justified the impugned interference was prescribed by law as required by article of the convention namely by article of the criminal code see dorota kania v poland no no october the applicants submission concerning the reversed burden of proof under that provision will be addressed by the court further below as it is a matter pertaining to the test of necessity in a democratic society see kasabova cited above the court furthermore accepts that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others namely the good name of the museum as well as its director and other members of the management within the meaning of article of the convention see dorota kania no cited above it notes that the interference further pursued the aim of ensuring the proper functioning of public institutions thus the only point at issue is whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve that aimiii necessary in a democratic society in assessing the necessity of the interference it is important to examine the way in which the relevant domestic authorities dealt with the case and in particular whether they applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article of the conventionα as to the denial of authorship the court notes at the outset that the applicant denied being the author of the written statements which were attributed to him by the domestic authorities and which are at the core of the present application see paragraphs and above in the light of the material at hand the court can not however consider that the domestic court has made a flagrant error of judgment on that point the question of whether the applicant was the author of the letters in question was duly addressed by the trial courts of two levels of jurisdiction moreover ample evidence comprising i two reports by an expert in the forensic examination of documents and ii the testimony of several witnesses was adduced see paragraphs above the court will thus proceed on the fair assumption that the applicant was indeed the author of the impugned statements signed staff of the museum of hunting and equestrianism see paragraph aboveβ as to the relevance of the courts caselaw in respect of the protection of whistleblowers the court should next consider whether the applicants reporting could be qualified as argued by him as whistleblowing within the meaning of its caselaw in this connection the court observes at the outset that the statements in question see paragraphs above may be described as allegations about the embezzlement of public funds corruption labour law infringements shortcomings in the organisation of the workplace and the mishandling of exhibits with the caveat that the full text of the impugned letters has not been communicated to the court by the parties or reproduced by the domestic courts in wording of the relevant judgments it appears that the allegations described above were of a general nature likewise it is unknown whether the letters contained any specific request for an investigation into or verification of the allegations in the courts view the general character of the impugned statements and the fact that they were strongly charged with the applicants value judgment undermines any seriousness of the irregularities that were being denounced in relation to the management and work conditions in the museum the use of public funds and the preservation of national heritage contrast mutatis mutandis medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i palomo sánchez and others v spain gc nos and others echr and boldea v romania no february the applicant who was a civil servant did not have any privileged or exclusive access to or direct knowledge of the information contained in the letters see by contrast aurelian oprea v romania no january in fact before the domestic court the applicant specifically stated that he had not had access to the financial documents of the museum and he did not know of incidents involving mismanagement irregularities in accounting bullying or inappropriate activity on the part of other employees see paragraph in fine above thus with regard to the circumstances of the case it does not seem that the applicant had secrecy or discretion duties with respect of his service and therefore his case can not be equated to any case of public disclosure of inhouse information in the public interest unlike as in the cases of whistleblowing the applicant was not in the position of being the only person or part of a small category of persons aware of what was happening at work and thus best placed to act in the public interest by alerting the employer or the public at large a contrario guja v moldova no february it is also unclear whether the applicant has suffered any repercussions at his workplace as a consequence of the reporting of the alleged wrongdoing attributed to him as it would appear the applicants employment contract was terminated in circumstances which are not directly linked to the libel incident in question see paragraph above and contrast guja cited above in view of these abovementioned factors the court does not find that the letters in question can be deemed to constitute whistleblowing as defined by the courts caselaw see bucur and toma v romania no january γ as to the third parties affected the court observes that the allegations in question were in part personally directed at pś the museums director the letters were not phrased in any insulting or obscene language see paragraphs and above see by contrast skałka v poland no may but in the courts view they clearly affected the director other members of the management as well as the institution which they ran on the basis of the contextual examination of the extracts of the disputed letters see paragraphs and above the court finds that the thrust of the impugned statements was in equal measure to i accuse pś in his capacity of the museums director of conduct that appeared irregular or unlawful to the letters author and to ii notify the competent state authorities thereof see also for the general principle governing the courts evaluation of statements nikowitz and verlagsgruppe news gmb h v austria no february in this latter context the court has indeed dealt with cases involving defamation that had a bearing on an individuals professional activities a doctor in kanellopoulou v greece no october the director of a statesubsidised company in tănăsoaica v romania no june and judges in belpietro v italy no september the present case however differs from the abovementioned cases in that no legal action had been taken against the applicant by pś in a private capacity see paragraphs and above on the other hand the balancing of the article and article rights that was carried out by the domestic courts was between on the one hand the applicant as the author of the statements and on the other hand the museum as a public entity pś and other members of its management see paragraphs and above having regard to its caselaw see paragraph above the court concludes that given the circumstances of the case the values conflicting with the applicants freedom of speech that the domestic court was called to balance were not of equal weight the protection of the museums good name being an institutional interest as opposed to a private concern should not have been considered as having the same degree of importance as the protection of pś and other members of the museums management which falls under the category of the protection of the reputation or rights of others within the meaning of article of the convention moreover the limits of acceptable criticism of that institutions management were wider than they would have been in relation to criticism of a private individualδ as to the audience targeted by the impugned statements the court accepts the applicants argument that in view of the fact that the allegations had concerned the museums director it would have been impracticable to report the issue to that person see paragraph above the court also observes that the information in question was not revealed to the public but reported in private letters to those bodies that had authority to verify and if necessary to remedy the situation complained of see paragraphs and above see also mutatis mutandis abovecited cases of guja and and medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others and in such cases the court has considered that the requirements of such protection have to be weighed not in relation to the interests of the freedom of the press or of open discussion of matters of public concern but rather against the applicants right to report irregularities in the conduct of state officials to a body competent to deal with such complaints see mutatis mutandis zakharov v russia no october kazakov v russia no december siryk v ukraine no march and marinova and others v bulgaria nos and others july the courts caselaw confirms that it is one of the precepts of the rule of law that citizens should be able to notify competent state officials about the conduct of public servants which to them appears irregular or unlawful see mutatis mutandis zakharov cited above kazakov cited above and siryk cited above at the same time the court notes that even a letter distributed within a small community such as a public institution can inevitably harm the reputation and professional image of the person concerned see peruzzi v italy no june it can not be said that civil servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent to which politicians do and should therefore be treated on an equal footing with the latter when it comes to criticism of their actions civil servants must enjoy public confidence in conditions free of undue perturbation if they are to be successful in performing their tasks it may therefore prove necessary to protect them from offensive and abusive verbal attacks in the course of their duties see peruzzi cited above see also janowski v poland gc no echr i and nikula v finland no echr ii by the same token civil servants should also be protected against abusive denunciationsε as to the consequences of the statements the court does not lose from sight the fact that calumnious denunciations to the competent authorities may result in investigating measures and may have very serious detrimental effects for the persons concerned causing unnecessary stress and anxiety moreover calumnious denunciations mean that the competent investigating or audit authorities can use more limited resources for the purposes of investigating or auditing other irregularities in the functioning of public authorities the court has no doubt that the impugned statements caused damage to the good name of the museum and called into question the management capacities of its director see paragraphs and above it also caused damage to the museum as such the court also notes that the preliminary criminal inquiry which was at some point initiated and ultimately discontinued see paragraph in fine above had certainly an impact upon the museums director in that it had caused him anxiety and stress as to the consequences of the abovementioned accusations being passed on to the authorities the court notes that in a series of management and tax audits of the museum were carried out by various public institutions see paragraphs and above on the basis of the material at hand the court notes that at least some of these audits had in fact been triggered by the impugned letters moreover as stated by the government and not effectively rebutted by the applicant as a consequence of the actions attributed to the applicant the museum had received less funding see paragraph aboveστ as to the nature of the statements another important factor relevant for the balancing exercise in the present case is the nature of the utterances in the instant case the domestic courts did not expressly determine to which category the statements attributed to the applicant belonged they did consider however that they were untrue that they had not been objectively confirmed and that they had been in fact disseminated in full knowledge of their falsehood with intent to harm the museum and its director see paragraphs in fine and above a similar argument was put forward by the government see paragraph above the court notes that the author did not refer throughout the text of the impugned letters to specific dates persons or incidents see mutatis mutandis kwiecień v poland no january he described in a general way the managerial shortcomings and the larger context in which they had allegedly occurred see paragraphs above in particular the applicant accused pś of theft bullying the staff and using public funds for organising exhibitions in the interest of private persons at the same time part of the statements was strongly charged with the authors subjective feelings and emotions it appears therefore that the impugned utterances are a mix of assertions of facts and value judgments compare kaperzyński v poland no april bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii gąsior v poland no february dybek v poland dec no september and zybertowicz v poland no january the court observes that the author of the impugned statements was a private individual and not a journalist media or nongovernmental organisation with a public watchdog function contrast bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above and medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above as such the author was not bound by the article duties and responsibilities for example the obligation to provide accurate and reliable information or to verify factual statements if such statements were being made to the same extent as would have been required by the ethics of journalism see bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above and błaja news sp z o o v poland no november at the same time instead of contacting the authorities overtly under his own name the applicant decided to send anonymous poisonpen letters the applicant explains that the intention behind sending the letter was to help fighting corruption and other offences the court notes in this context that the applicants allegations not only proved false but the applicant failed to adduce a sufficient factual basis to support his assertions of facts and value judgmentsζ as to the nature and severity of the penalty lastly the court reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are also factors to be taken into consideration when assessing the proportionality of the interference see ceylan v turkey gc no echr iv and malisiewicz gąsior v poland no april while the use of criminallaw sanctions in defamation cases is not in itself disproportionate the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are factors to be taken into account because they must not be such as to dissuade the press or others who engage in public debate from taking part in a discussion of matters of legitimate public concern see lewandowska malec cited above with further references in the instant case the applicant was criminally convicted a fine was imposed on him in an amount equivalent to eur he was also ordered to pay various costs amounting to eur see paragraph above the court observes that the criminal conviction must obviously have had negative consequences for the applicants career especially given the fact that he was a civil servant seeking reemployment see mutatis mutandis heinisch v germany no july nevertheless the court finds that the cumulative effect of in the circumstances of the present case the criminal conviction or the aggregate amount of the financial penalties could not be considered as having had a chilling effect on the exercise by the applicant of his freedom of expression in contrast with lewandowska malec cited above consequently the sanction imposed on the applicant does not appear disproportionatec the courts overall conclusion in the light of the above considerations the court finds that in the case at hand the domestic courts adduced sufficient and relevant reasons to justify the interference with the applicants freedom of expression there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the courtdeclares unanimously the application admissible holds by five votes to two that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on december pursuant to rule and of the rules of court signature_p_ liv tigerstedt ksenija turkovićdeputy registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the separate opinion of judges felici and ktistakis is annexed to this judgment ktult dissenting opinion of judges felici and ktistakiswe regret that we are unable to agree with the majority of the court that the applicants criminal conviction which resulted in the imposition of a fine was compatible with article of the convention for the reasons stated below the applicant denounced by means of private letters see paragraph of the judgment sent exclusively to competent state authorities the tax office the supreme audit office the regional prosecutor and the presidents office matters relating to financial and employment shortcomings on the part of his employer a state museum and the director of that museum thus the objective conditions of the criminal offence of defamation are not fulfilled in that the impugned statements could not if only because of their private character lower the standing in the publics opinion or undermine public confidence article of the polish criminal code see of the judgment it follows that the restriction on the applicants freedom of expression was not provided for in the national criminal law further the restriction did not serve a legitimate aim first the aim of ensuring the proper functioning of public institutions see paragraph of the judgment is not as such one of the legitimate aims exhaustively listed in article of the convention see catan and others v the republic of moldova and russia gc nos and others echr extracts furthermore the aim of preserving the good name of the museum of hunting and equestrianism see paragraphs and of the judgment can not be considered as part of the protection of the reputation or rights of others when issues of financial and employment transparency within the publiclaw legal entity in question were raised exclusively and privately before the competent state authorities the present case differs from the courts relevant caselaw about universities where the issues of concern concerned exclusively academic professional standards and were raised in public see kharlamov v russia no october sorguç v turkey no june and kula v turkey no june finally the aim of protection of the rights of others namely the good name of the director of the museum and of the other members of the management see paragraphs and of the judgment is not fulfilled in the present case because the director and the other members of the management board were not a party to the impugned criminal proceedings and they never brought any civil action against the applicant see paragraph finally with regard to the proportionality of the restriction on the applicants freedom of expression the courts caselaw attaches considerable importance to the audience targeted by the impugned statements see for example grigoriades v greece november reports of judgments and decisions vii kazakov v russia no december and sofranschi v moldova no december as mentioned at the beginning of our opinion the applicant addressed his complaints by way of private correspondence only to the competent state officials and did not make them known to the general public we consider that this element is crucial in assessing the proportionality of the interference in our view citizens should be able to notify at least privately competent state officials about the conduct of civil servants which to them appears irregular or unlawful because this is one of the precepts of the rule of law see zakharov v russia no october bezymyannyy v russia no april and lešník v slovakia no echr iv in consequence we conclude that the restriction on the applicants freedom of expression was not necessary in a democratic society,,,
20,the applicant was born in and lives in vienna he is of bulgarian origin on july a letter signed by the applicant was sent to the sofia municipality in that letter the applicant complained of construction works undertaken by his nephew ak which had significantly altered the house which had been owned by his parents and where he had been born the applicant had become aware of that during his stay in sofia in may he expressed his indignation about the works undertaken as well as doubts as to their legality and requested to be sent copies of all documents concerning them stating that he intended to bring the matter to court he stated in addition that ak held for the property in question an illegal notarial deed acquired on the basis of a forged notarial deed these allegations concerned the notarial deeds of and described in paragraph below ak had been the beneficiary under both of them the applicant indicated an intention to challenge these deeds in court in december ak initiated a private criminal prosecution of the applicant in his complaint he stated that he had become aware of the applicants letter by chance and claimed that the applicant had defamed him in particular by stating that he had an illegal notarial deed acquired on the basis of a forged notarial deed this implied that ak had committed a criminal offence namely using a forged document in the same proceedings ak also brought a tort action against the applicant claiming bulgarian levs bgn the equivalent of euros eur in nonpecuniary damage the applicant objected to the complaint against him contending that what he had stated was true and that he had never claimed that ak had actually used the forged documents in a decision of the sofia district court of october the criminal prosecution of the applicant was discontinued as timebarred and the examination of the case continued only as regards aks tort action that action was allowed in a judgment of the sofia district court of january the domestic court stated expressly in that judgment that it did not have to establish the elements of the criminal offence of defamation it had to establish in accordance with section of the obligations and contracts act see paragraph below whether the applicants behaviour amounted to a tortious act and whether ak had suffered any damage as a result as to the facts of the case the sofia district court established that ak had become the owner of part of the property at issue after his mother had donated to him a share in and he had purchased another share from a coowner in both transactions had been attested in notarial deeds in a further notarial deed of ak had been recognised as the owner of part of the property in he had obtained a permit to enlarge the existing house the construction works had been carried out in and a representative of the building control authorities had visited the site on july and had established breaches of the relevant rules but no administrative sanction had been ordered against ak an additional check had been carried out on november after one of the coowners of the property not the applicant had complained that check had showed that part of the construction works undertaken by ak did not correspond to the construction permit it appears however that ak had not been ordered to demolish the unlawfully constructed parts further complaints by the coowners concerning the construction undertaken by ak had been sent to the municipality on may the sofia district court heard in addition witnesses who said that following the applicants allegations against him ak had become nervous and had had unspecified problems with the authorities the sofia district court found that it had never been shown that the notarial deeds in aks favour had been flawed meaning that they had to be considered valid the applicants allegations that one of these deeds had been illegal and another one forged could have affected aks good name in society as they suggested that ak had profited from using unlawful means those allegations had also damaged aks professional reputation since he was working in construction this was so even bearing in mind that the municipal authorities had taken no particular action against ak and that checks on the construction site had been incited by other coowners of the property the above considerations were valid regardless of whether the applicant had committed the criminal offence of defamation since this was not the subject of the proceedings the applicant had had resort to his constitutional right to petition the authorities but the exercise of that right did not have to involve causing damage to others the sofia district court ordered the applicant to pay ak bgn the equivalent of eur in nonpecuniary damage plus default interest it considered such an award to be just pointing out that ak had enjoyed a good name in society that the applicants allegations had also affected aks professional reputation and that the allegations had been made before a municipal body and not in private correspondence upon an appeal by the applicant in a final judgment of august the sofia city court upheld the district courts judgment endorsing its reasoning the applicant has not submitted documents showing that he actually paid the amount awarded to ak nor has he claimed to have made any such payment ii relevant domestic law and practice article of the constitution of provides that citizens have the right to make complaints proposals and petitions to the authorities article of the criminal code criminalises defamation the offence and the relevant domestic practice concerning it have been described in marinova and others v bulgaria nos and others and july section of the obligations and contracts act provides that everyone is obliged to make good the damage which they have through their fault caused to another by article of the code of criminal procedure the criminal court is obliged to rule on a civil claim that has already been accepted for examination in the criminal proceedings even after the associated criminal prosecution has become timebarred or the accused has been acquitted according to the supreme court of cassation the criminal court has to rule on a civil claim even where it can not rule on the criminal liability of the accused because civil liability stems from a tortious act and not from a criminal offence тълкувателно решение от г на вкс по тълк д г оснк решение от г на вкс по н д г i н о нкthe lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that after having complained to the authorities he had been found liable to pay damages to ak for defamation article of the convention reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits arguments of the parties the government contended that the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression had been in compliance with the requirements of article in particular it had been lawful since the relevant provisions of the criminal code were clear and accessible and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation of others moreover the interference had been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued for the following reasons the applicants criminal prosecution had been discontinued and the criminal courts had only examined aks civil claim against him the applicant had not been a journalist or a whistleblower nor had ak been a public official which meant that the authorities had owed no special protection to the applicant and ak had not been obliged to tolerate criticism the applicant had made a statement of fact not a value judgment and had not proven the veracity of the facts alleged those facts were such that they could have affected aks reputation the damages ordered against the applicant had not been excessive the award of damages had been made in adversarial proceedings and the domestic courts had given sufficient reasons for their decisions the applicant pointed out that his letter had aimed to trigger a check by the authorities on possible irregularities and argued that being held liable on that ground had been contrary to the principles of democracy and could dissuade potential future complainants he contested in addition many of the domestic courts findings as to the facts of the case the courts assessment the general principles developed in the courts caselaw concerning freedom of expression have recently been summarised in morice v france gc no echr and medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june turning to the case at hand the court observes that the court decisions finding the applicant liable to pay damages to ak amounted to an interference with his right to freedom of expression under article of the convention in previous cases against bulgaria under article of the convention concerning complaints addressed to the authorities and where the applicants had been convicted of defamation in criminal proceedings the court expressed doubts as to the lawfulness of the interferences with their rights these were based on the fact that the applicants had not disseminated injurious statements while the dissemination was an requisite element of the offence of defamation as interpreted by the former bulgarian supreme court and the current supreme court of cassation the applicants cases had not reached the supreme court of cassation so that it could authoritatively rule on the matter however the court decided that it did not have to pronounce on the question of lawfulness since it considered that the interferences with the applicants rights were in any event disproportionate see marinova and others nos and others july zdravko stanev v bulgaria no no july sapundzhiev v bulgaria committee no september in the present case similarly to the ones cited in the previous paragraph the proceedings against the applicant were initially concerned with his criminal liability for defamation however his criminal prosecution subsequently became timebarred and the domestic courts did not seek to establish whether the applicant had committed the criminal offence of defamation they only examined the civil claim brought by ak in the same proceedings see paragraphs and above in view thereof the court sees no reason to call into question the lawfulness of the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression as it did in the cases cited in the previous paragraph on the ground of any failure of the domestic courts to establish the elements of the criminal offence of defamation the interference was based on section of the obligations and contracts act see paragraphs and above the court finds therefore that the interference with the applicants rights was prescribed by law as required under article of the convention the court considers furthermore that the interference pursued a legitimate aim namely the protection of the reputation and rights of ak the salient question is whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society that is to say whether it corresponded to a pressing social need whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons given by the national authorities were relevant and sufficient see among others janowski v poland gc no echr i the applicant was found civilly liable for having stated that ak was in possession of an illegal notarial deed acquired on the basis of a forged notarial deed see paragraph above the court sees no reason to question the domestic courts findings of fact in that regard namely that the applicant had made that statement and that it was untrue moreover even if it acknowledges that the impugned statement was not particularly aggressive denigrating or insulting and notes that no adverse practical consequences for ak such as checks or inspections on the part of the authorities stemmed from the applicants letter the court is not to question the national courts conclusion that ak nevertheless suffered some damage as a result that conclusion was based in particular on witness testimony and appears to be adequately reasoned see paragraphs above the applicant was found civilly liable for one particular statement contained in his letter of july namely as mentioned above that ak was in possession of an illegal notarial deed acquired on the basis of a forged notarial deed see paragraph above that statement was addressed to the sofia municipality but that local authority was not competent to verify such a matter or take any measures the applicant said in his letter that he intended to challenge aks notarial deeds in court which was indeed the authority competent to resolve the matter but has not shown that he took any action in that regard accordingly it can not be said that the applicant was found liable for having made before an authority a complaint the latter was competent to deal with contrast marinova and others and sapundzhiev both cited above on the contrary it would appear that in making the impugned statement the applicant deliberately sought to harm his nephew the statement at issue was not made impulsively or in the heat of a discussion but was sent to the authorities about two months after the applicant had visited sofia and had become aware of the construction undertaken by his nephew see paragraph above it is also significant that no sanction was imposed to the applicant with regard to the remaining statements in his letter of july in particular that he was indignant about the works undertaken by his nephew and that he had doubts as to their legality in addition the applicant did not make allegations of misconduct against a public official with regard to whom the limits of acceptable criticism would have been wider contrast marinova and others cited above for the reasons above the court finds that the interference with the applicants freedom of expression corresponded to a pressing social need as mentioned above it notes furthermore that in finding the applicant civilly liable for having made the impugned statement the domestic courts gave relevant and sufficient reasons as to the sanction imposed on the applicant the court observes that the criminal prosecution against him became timebarred and he was only found civilly liable the applicant was ordered to pay to ak a sum equivalent to eur plus default interest see paragraph above the applicant has not submitted details on his personal financial situation and the court is unable to assess whether such an award against him was excessive and imposed on him a disproportionate burden furthermore the applicant does not appear to have actually paid any part of that sum see paragraph above nor has it been claimed that ak has attempted to obtain such a payment moreover seeing that as noted above the case did not concern a complaint by the applicant to an authority competent to deal with it it can not be said that the finding of the applicant civilly liable risked having the effect of stifling potential future complaints contrast sapundzhiev cited above having regard to the above the court concludes that the interference with the applicants freedom of expression was necessary in a democratic society and thus met the requirements of article of the convention there has accordingly been no violation of article for these reasons the court unanimously declares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on may pursuant to rule and of the rules of court claudia westerdiek angelika nußberger registrar president,,,
21,in and lives in kemerovo he was represented by mr i morokhin a lawyer practising in kemerovo the government were represented by mr m galperin representative of the russian federation to the european court of human rights the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows impugned material and its dissemination with reference to the findings made in the domestic proceedings see below the government submitted that the applicant had registered as a user on vkontakte hereinafter vk a popular online social network in russia and had created a user account by registering on vk he had accepted its use regulations that required its users to provide full and truthful information and prohibited propaganda or incitement of racial religious ethnic hatred or enmity the applicant had named his account roman kilin on june using his personal computer the applicant had connected to the internet from his home network via his internetaccess provider and uploaded a video file entitled russia granny on an unspecified date prior to november the applicant had uploaded an audio file containing a song called glory to russia performed by kolovrat a music band the video lasted for one minute and showed a young man approaching an elderly woman who was played by a man they engaged in a dialogue in the russian language for a full description of the content see annex to the present judgment russia is a socalled mockumentary also in russian directed by pavel bardin about neo nazis skinheads in russia the plot of the film came from the imagination of the author but the imaginary story was based on life in russia in the film members of a gang called russia are filming propaganda videos to post on the internet after a while they become accustomed to the camera and stop paying attention to it the leader of the gang discovers that his sister is dating a southern caucasian man this family drama develops into a tragedy the film has no closing credits but a list of people killed by skinheads in russia in at the end playing over silence the film was screened at the berlin international film festival director pavel bardin won the discovery of the year nika award for the film according to the applicant the piece was also shown on russian television channels the audio file contained a musical composition glory to russia with lyrics in the russian language see annex to the present judgment criminal proceedi ngs against the applicantinvestigation on an unspecified date and in unspecified circumstances the applicant or the relevant vk account came to the attention of the russian authorities in november the authorities created a vk account and sent a friend request to the roman kilin account after the request had been accepted the authorities gained access to the content that included the impugned video see paragraph above fortyseven people who had also been added as the accounts friends had similar access see also paragraphs and below later on the authorities also examined through their vk account the impugned audio file see paragraph above in september the regional office of the federal security service initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant his home was searched and his personal computer was seized in september the investigator commissioned a linguistic and psychological assessment of the impugned material by officials of the kemerovo state university the dean of the faculty of social and psychological studies and the deputy chair of the unit of stylistics and rhetoric on november they issued their report see paragraphs below concerning the video they made the following findingsa linguist the video was a part of a wellknown feature film russia and was a selfcontained clip in terms of its content it showed a negative encounter between an elderly woman and azerbaijanis soured because of a lack of honesty and decency implying that azerbaijani vendors fooled their clients and thereby putting forward a negative image of people of azerbaijani ethnicity the video did not refer to any specific person the negative image was not personified thus the video showed a negative image of the entire ethnic group the video contained two calls put forward by the elderly woman look maybe it is better to beat the shit out of all those blackies and to throw them throw them out of moscow well the holy cause is not tricky she takes a bat in her hands the first two indirect calls were strengthened by the last one emphasising the positive assessment of the suggested actions as well as by the ensuing actual conduct consisting in the beating up of non russian people presumably of azerbaijani origin in view of the context of the video the last call here is how russians must fight for their rights is demonstrated by the use of the words must and fight the expert concluded that the video contained a call to violence aimed at inciting discord between russians and azerbaijanis a call to beat them with a bat as well as a call to violence aimed at violating their rights a call to throw them out of moscowb psychologist the overall context of the russia film meant that its authors aimed in the impugned part to show the tools and methods of manipulative impact on the part of nationalist organisations and by implication to strengthen the protection of the individual and mass consciousness against such manipulation however when taken out of context that part acquired a different meaning by posting it as separate material that is to say without regard to and in isolation from the authors intended message the person concerned pursued his or her own message the video created a negative image of people of azerbaijani origin by attributing to them deceitful and indecent actions while omitting to make any disclaimer or reservations thus this image was intended to relate to the entire ethnic group in opposition to a russian woman who could not be deceptive and thus had to stay away from the markets taken over by azerbaijanis the video then demonstrated the actions to be taken namely physical assault against them and their removal from moscow such actions were presented as positive and were approved of as a holy cause and the way russians had to fight for their rights as to the audio they concluded as followsa linguist the content of the song opposed russians and non russians who were called blackies черные in modern russian this word was used as a pejorative in respect of the people of certain races or ethnic origins asian black or from the caucasus they were presented in the song as enemies that russians had to fight against the nationalist tone of the song followed from the use of patriotic tropes the fact that it was directed toward russians the solicitation of the support of other slavic peoples the use of the notion of our kind the non russians were depicted as dangerous the song contained several calls the blackie shit must be thrown out of russia the use of the word must come on guys lets put on our bomber jackets and boots a call to get military clothing on lets shout loud glory to russia and we will fight the expert concluded that the song contained a call to violence aimed at inciting discord between russians and non russians a call to fight against them as well as a call to violence aimed at violating their rights a call to throw them out of russiab psychologist the message of the songs author and the person who had posted it in the internet coincided the song contained a very negative depiction of non russians together with insulting and emotional adjectives while omitting to make any disclaimer or reservations thus the content concerned all non russian ethnic groups they were attributed a dominant position in russia thus the content was aimed at inciting ethnic discord between ethnic russians and those of another ethnicity the content also contained expressions calling for a fight to not give up and to win meaning violence against non russians with the aim of throwing them out of russia trial the applicant stood trial before a justice of the peace the justice of the peace held a public hearing the applicant denied that he had been the user of the vk account roman kilin according to him at the time of the criminal proceeding against him the official register of extremist materials had listed no material containing the film or part thereof or any audio material containing the lyrics of the song mentioned above the justice of the peace heard a number of witnesses who stated that through their own vk accounts they had communicated with the account roman kilin that they had had no doubt that they had been in touch with the applicant that they had been accepted as friends thus gaining access to the content of that account that they had had seen and some of them had actually accessed the impugned video and audio files on april the justice of the peace convicted the applicant under article of the criminal code see paragraph below and sentenced him to a suspended term of eighteen months imprisonment first appeal the applicant appealed to the leninskiy district court of kemerovo by a procedural decision dated july the district court decided to hold the appeal hearing in camera it stated that since the offence under article was listed in the chapter of the criminal code concerning offences against the foundations of the constitutional regime and national security it was relevant to ensure the safety of the persons participating in the proceedings it was indicated in the procedural decision that it could be appealed against to the kemerovo regional court within ten days the applicant did not appeal the applicant and his lawyers took part in the appeal hearing before the district court the applicant pleaded not guilty and refused to give any oral testimony in a judgment of august the appellate court quashed the justice of the peaces judgment considering that it did not properly describe the facts held against the applicant having reexamined the case the appellate court considered that by posting the impugned video and audio in his vk account the applicant had realised that it had been possible for them to be accessed by an unlimited number of people and had acted with the intent to incite ethnic discord национальная рознь and to incite others to commit violations of the rights and freedoms of people of non russian ethnicity нерусские национальности between june and november he had made public calls to carry out extremist activities in the appellate courts view the video and the audio contained calls to violent actions aimed at inciting ethnic discord between russians and people of other ethnicities and aimed at violating their rights and freedoms specifically the impugned video contained calls to violent actions with the aim of inducing ethnic discord between russians and people of azerbaijani ethnicity and at violating their rights and freedoms in the appellate courts view when registering a vk account and then uploading or posting information a user i had to realise that such information became accessible to all registered users of the website ii wanted that that would happen because that together with his personal details mentioned in the account reflected his interests and hobbies which helped in acquiring new friends among the website users the court concluded that in view of those considerations the information contained in a vk account was widely accessible to an unlimited number of people in reaching those conclusions the appellate court referred to the witness statements made before the justice of the peace and some other witness statements made before the justice of the peace which had not been however assessed in the firstinstance judgment mr p a deputy dean at the kemerovo state medical university stated that he had examined the impugned video and audio which had been available at the applicants account he had asked the applicant why he had posted that content the latter replied that he had posted it some six months before when he had been interested in national ideas another witness mr b stated that he had asked a similar question and that the applicant replied that he had posted it just like that that is for no particular reason mr t the applicants secondaryschool classmate stated that until late the applicants webpage had been open and that he had examined the impugned material mr s apparently a lawenforcement officer stated that in november the authorities had created a vk account and sent a friend request without any further explanation to the roman kilin account after the request had been accepted the authorities had gained access to the content that had included the impugned video fortyseven people had had similar access as they had also been added as the accounts friends the appellate court stated that in addition to those statements the applicants guilt was confirmed by some other evidencea it followed from the report issued by linguists and psychologists see paragraphs above that the communicative intention of the author of the russia film had been to uncover the means and methods used by nationalist organisations to psychologically manipulate others and thereby to reinforce individual and societal protection against such harmful influence when disseminating the video the person concerned the applicant had aimed at inciting ethnic discord and at violent and other actions aiming at violating the rights and freedoms of people of azerbaijani ethnicity the author of the impugned audio and the person who had disseminated it the applicant had aimed at inciting ethnic discord and violent and other actions aiming at violating the rights and freedoms of people of non russian ethnicities the video contained a call to violence aimed at inciting discord between russians and azerbaijanis a call to use a bat to hit azerbaijanis and a call to violent actions aimed at violating their rights and freedoms a call to throw azerbaijanis out of moscow the audio contained a call to violence aiming at inciting ethnic discord between russian and non russian ethnicities a call to fight with non russians a call to violence aimed at violating their rights and freedoms a call to expel them from russiab an audio recording of a telephone conversation between the applicant and a woman in which the applicant had stated well shoot them down and russia for russians in the context referring to people of non russian ethnicityc as to article of the criminal code calls to extremist activities could be expressed orally in writing or through another form for instance in audio or video works the fact that the person who disseminated publicly such material was not its author did not mean that the calls to extremist activities did not emanate from that person by intentionally disseminating such material that person expressed his or her endorsement or approval and intended that others would be receptive to the calls contained in the impugned material thus that person had to be held as personally wanting to incite others to carry out an extremist activityd by adding information to a personal vk account the applicant had to realise that such information became accessible to other registered vk users and wanted that outcome psychologically with the aim of acquiring new friends among users by way of sharing his personal data hobbies and interestse unlike disseminating extremist material which was an offence under the code of administrative offences prosecution under article of the criminal code required a public call for extremist activities to be carried out including ethnic discord and violation of others rights and freedoms on account of their ethnicity the appellate court sentenced the applicant to a suspended term of eighteen months imprisonment the period of probation was set to eighteen months and during that period the applicant was required to regularly report to the authority supervising the execution of sentences and was not allowed to change the place of residence or his educational institutional without notifying that authority the court referred to the nature of the offence the degree of danger to the public involved the mitigating circumstances the fact that it had been the applicants first criminal prosecution his age and his character second appeal the applicant filed a cassation appeal with the kemerovo regional court arguing as followsa there had been no evidence that he had been the user of the vk account that he had retained exclusive control over it without any unauthorised access by third parties such as the authorities through the use of the socalled sorm technologies that he had accessed from his personal computer at his home and downloaded to it or uploaded to the vk account the impugned video or audiob where a work of art such as the russia film or the glory to russia song had not been classified as extremist material under the suppression of extremism act a quotation from that work of art could not be perceived or classified in a criminal case as calling for extremist activitiesc the appellate court had not established any calls to extremist activities on the part of the applicant as required under article of the criminal code instead he had in substance been convicted of disseminating extremist material which was an offence under article of the code of administrative offencesd there had been no valid reason under article of the code of criminal procedure to hold the appeal hearing in camera on november the regional court upheld the appeal decision of august the regional courts decision did not specify whether a public hearing had been held however it stated as follows having examined at the hearing on november the cassation appeal statement submitted by the applicants lawyers and having heard the opinion expressed by the applicant and his lawyers and the prosecutor the court has decided as follows indeed the appeal court decided under article of the code of criminal procedure to hold the hearing in camera and issued a related decision providing the reasons in it it follows from the material in the case file that the justice of the peace held a public hearing at which the evidence submitted by the parties was examined the defence did not appeal against the decision to hold the appeal hearing in camera and in their cassation appeal has not submitted convincing arguments to the effect that the appeal hearing in camera significantly impinged upon the defences rights in so far as the presentation of evidence was concerned relevant legal framework and practicerussian law criminal code of the russian federation article of the criminal code of the russian federation the criminal code as in force at the relevant time provided as follows public calls for extremist activities to be carried out shall be punishable by a fine of up to russian roubles or an amount equivalent to the convicted persons wages or other income for a period of up to two years or by detention for a period of four to six months or by imprisonment for a period of up to three years pursuant to ruling no of june by the plenary supreme court of the russian federation public calls under article of the criminal code are defined as appeals to other people with the aim of inciting inducing them to carry out extremist activities as defined in the suppression of extremism act see paragraph below the crime under article is deemed completed from the moment of a public dissemination of at least one call irrespective of whether one succeeded in inciting inducing others to carry out extremist activities paragraph of the ruling article of the criminal code punished actions aimed at inciting hatred or enmity and humiliating the dignity of an individual or a group of people on the ground of gender race ethnic origin language background religious beliefs or membership of a social group committed publicly or through a massmedia outlet pursuant to ruling no mentioned above a public dissemination of the information that justifies the need to commit unlawful actions against other people on account of their race ethnicity religious beliefs and the like should be classified under article of the criminal code where the elements of the corpus delicti are present pursuant to articles and of the criminal code there are two types of criminal guilt intent and negligence direct intent прямой умысел requires proving

offences under articles and of the criminal code require proof of direct intent suppression of extremism act federal law of july no fz on suppression of extremist activities hereinafter the suppression of extremism act as in force at the relevant time provided as follows section basic concepts for purposes of the present federal law the following basic concepts shall apply extremist activity extremism is incitement of social racial ethnic национальная or religious discord розньviolation of rights freedoms and legitimate interests of a person and citizen on account of his social racial ethnic национальная religious or linguistic origin принадлежность or attitude to religion public appeals to carry out the abovementioned activities code of criminal procedure of the russian federation under article of the code of criminal procedure ccr p a court a prosecutor and certain other public officials should order measures of protection that fall within their area of competence for instance a court hearing in camera under article of the ccr p where there is sufficient information that a crime victim a witness or another person participating in the criminal proceedings or their next of kin were threatened with death or violence destruction of or damage to their property or with other unlawful actions pursuant to article of the ccr p holding a hearing in camera was possible on the basis of a court decision if the proceedings could lead to the disclosure of a state secret or another classified information the case concerned crimes committed by minors proceedings concerning sex crimes or other crimes could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information on the parties private lives or to the disclosure of humiliating information a hearing in camera was essential for the safety of parties and their relatives a court decision on holding a hearing in camera was to give the exact factual circumstances on which that decision had been based such a decision could concern the entire proceedings or a part thereof it follows from ruling no of december by the plenary supreme court that a violation of the rules relating to a public hearing in a criminal case may justify the quashing of the relevant judgment where such a violation entailed or could entail taking an unlawful nonreasoned or unfair judgment paragraph other material on december the council of europes european commission against racism and intolerance ecri adopted general policy recommendation no on combating hate speech for relevant summaries see among others atamanchuk v russia no february and karastelev and others v russia no october the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that his criminal conviction had violated article of the convention which in the relevant parts reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others admissibility the government argued that the complaint had to be declared incompatible ratione materiae with reference to article of the convention the applicant had posted materials that incited ethnic hatred and discrimination the applicant made no comment article of the convention reads as follows nothing in the convention may be interpreted as implying for any state group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the convention the court reiterates that the effect of article of the convention is to negate the exercise of the convention right that the applicant seeks to vindicate in the proceedings before the court see perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extracts article is only applicable on an exceptional basis and in extreme cases and should in cases concerning article of the convention only be resorted to if it is immediately clear that the impugned statements sought to deflect this article from its real purpose by employing the right to freedom of expression for ends clearly contrary to the values of the convention see perinçek cited above and pastörs v germany no october the decisive point when assessing whether the statements are removed from the protection of article by article is whether those statements were directed against the conventions underlying values or whether by making the statement the author attempted to rely on the convention to engage in an activity or perform acts aimed at the destruction of the rights and freedoms laid down in it this point however is not immediately clear in the present case and overlaps with the question whether there was an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression and whether this interference was necessary in a democratic society thus the court finds that the question whether article is to be applied must be joined to the merits of the complaint under article of the convention see perinçek cited above the court also notes that this complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merits the parties submissions the applicant argued that article of the convention did not allow criminal prosecution on account of ones expression of sympathy toward certain information or ideas expressed in an excerpt of a cinematographic work in particular where such information or ideas had not been banned on the national level subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb one could not be held criminally liable for posting a part of a work of art which had not been banned in the respondent state in any event the applicant had not posted the impugned material in convicting him the russian courts exceeded their discretion and thus the interference was not necessary in a democratic society the government stated that the criminal conviction amounted to an interference with the applicants freedom of expression however it was prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity and public safety as well as for preventing disorder and crime and protecting the rights of others the applicants conviction was a proportionate reaction on the part of the state with the aim of limiting access of other people to aggressive discriminatory or provocative statements the courts assessmenta interference the applicant was convicted for making thirdparty content available for access to others using an account on a socialnetworking website both at the national level and before the court the applicant denied that he had been the user of the relevant vk account and alleged that the impugned video and audio had been published on it by others firstly the court considers that the applicants criminal conviction for the offence of public calls to extremist activities punishable under article of the criminal code was directed at activities falling within the scope of freedom of expression as protected by article of the convention the court reiterates in this connection that owing to its accessibility and capacity to store and communicate vast amounts of information the internet has now become one of the principal means by which individuals exercise their right to freedom of expression and information the internet provides essential tools for participation in activities and discussions concerning political issues and issues of general interest it enhances the publics access to news and facilitates the dissemination of information in general article of the convention guarantees everyone the freedom to receive and impart information and ideas it applies not only to the content of information but also to the means of its dissemination for any restriction imposed on the latter necessarily interferes with that freedom see ahmet yıldırım v turkey no echr for instance the court has previously stated that the prosecution for posting a hyperlink to defamatory material online amounted to an interference under article of the convention see magyar jeti zrt v hungary no december second the court reiterates that where an applicant argues that by attributing to him statements he had never made and convicting him in relation to those statements the domestic courts indirectly stifled the exercise of his freedom of expression he may rely on the protection of article of the convention see stojanović v croatia no september to hold otherwise would be tantamount to requiring him to acknowledge the acts of which he stood accused it should be borne in mind in this connection that the right not to incriminate oneself although not specifically mentioned in article of the convention is a generally recognised international standard which lies at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under that provision see müdür duman v turkey no october and zülküf murat kahraman v turkey no july in the present case the applicant chose to remain silent during the domestic proceedings he maintained the same position before the court at the same time both at national level and before the court he put forward an alternative line of argument consisting in substance in challenging the compliance of his prosecution with article of the convention having said this the court finds no reason to disagree with the domestic courts finding that the applicant used the vk account retained exclusive access to it and made accessible the impugned material using it the court will therefore proceed on the assumption that there has been an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression under article of the conventionb justification of the interference to the extent that the applicant may rely on article of the convention see paragraphs and above such interference infringes article of the convention unless it satisfies the requirements of paragraph of that provision it has to be determined whether the interference was prescribed by law pursued one or more legitimate aims as defined in that paragraph and was necessary in a democratic society to achieve those aimsi prescribed by law the court notes that the applicants prosecution had a basis in article of the criminal code read together with section of the suppression of extremism act see paragraphs and above in his observations the applicant raised no specific argument suggesting that those provisions of russian law had not been complied with including that their application to him had not been foreseeable thus the court considers that the interference was prescribed by lawii legitimate aim it is with reference to the governments submissions and foremost on account of the related domestic findings on the necessity of the interference in pursuance of a legitimate aim or at least of the rationale for the underlying legislative framework that the court would take a stance on the relevant legitimate aims see pt v the republic of moldova no may when referring to a legitimate aim the government must demonstrate that in acting to penalise an applicant the domestic authorities had that legitimate aim in mind compare perinçek cited above in relation to the governments assertions in that case on the legitimate aim of preventing disorder the government argued that the applicants conviction had been in the interests of national security territorial integrity and public safety as well as for preventing disorder and crime and protecting the rights of others see paragraph above the court notes that the applicants conviction concerned calls for violent actions aimed at i inciting discord between russians and people of other ethnicities in particular azerbaijanis and ii violating the latters rights and freedoms because of their ethnicity the court is not satisfied that the interests of national security territorial integrity and public safety were shown to be pertinent in the present case the court considers however that the applicants criminal prosecution can be regarded as having been intended for the prevention of disorder and crime and for the protection of the rights of others within the meaning of article of the convention specifically the dignity of people of non russian ethnicity in particular azerbaijani ethnicity in aksu v turkey gc nos and and echr the court observed that discrimination on account of inter alia a persons ethnicity is a form of racial discrimination racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and in view of its perilous consequences requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction the court also held inter alia that negative stereotyping of an ethnic group was capable when reaching a certain level of having an impact on the groups sense of identity and on its members feelings of selfworth and selfconfidence ibid see also lewit v austria no and october and atamanchuk v russia no and february in the courts view incitement of discord between ethnic groups through calls to violence may be prejudicial to all the groups involved and other sectors of the populationiii necessary in a democratic society it remains to be determined whether the criminal conviction was necessary in a democratic society in the pursuance of those legitimate aimsα general principles the court reiterates that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article of the convention it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society as enshrined in article freedom of expression is subject to exceptions which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly see satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation what the court has to do is inter alia to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether the national authorities adduced relevant and sufficient reasons to justify it including whether they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see bédat v switzerland gc no march β applications of the principles in the present case the applicant was given a suspended sentence of eighteen months imprisonment for making thirdparty content one video recording and one audio recording available for access through an account on a socialnetworking website as the criminal courts adjudged in his case by doing so the applicant made public calls to i ethnic discord through recourse to violence against members of non russian ethnic groups in russia in particular people of the azerbaijani ethnic origin as regards the video and ii violating their rights and freedoms on account of their ethnicity also through recourse to violence against them in the assessment of the interference with freedom of expression in cases of this type alongside the general principles formulated in the courts caselaw under article of the convention see perinçek cited above various factors may prove to be pertinent and have to be taken into account including the social and political background against which the statements were made whether the statements fairly construed and seen in their immediate or wider context can be seen as a direct or indirect call to violence or as a justification of violence hatred or intolerance the manner in which the statements were made and their capacity direct or indirect to lead to harmful consequences ibid it is the interplay between the various factors rather than any of them taken in isolation that determines the outcome of a particular case ibid including where the balance had to be struck between freedom of expression and the rights of others ibid and the court has previously taken into account the intention of or the purpose being pursued by the applicant in particular where that consideration had formed part of the criminal courts reasoning see jersild v denmark september and series a no féret v belgium no july perinçek cited above stomakhin v russia no and may pastörs v germany no october and atamanchuk cited above and for example the fact that the author of controversial statements acted without a racist motive see perinçek or intention to incite hatred or violence or a fortiori that the purpose of disseminating such statements was to denounce or expose racist or intolerant views see jersild has been treated by the court as a relevant factor for assessing whether the applicants criminal convictions were convincingly shown to have been necessary in a democratic society under article of the convention that consideration is particularly relevant for applying article of the convention in cases where conversely by making the statements the applicants attempted to rely on the convention to engage in an activity or perform acts aimed at the destruction of the rights and freedoms laid down in it see pavel ivanov v russia dec no february and belkacem v belgium dec no june rather than for instance at contributing to a debate on a matter of public interest in this connection the court has also taken note of ecris position that in some instances a particular feature of the use of hate speech is that it may be intended to incite or can reasonably be expected to have the effect of inciting others to commit acts of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those targeted by it the element of incitement entails there being either a clear intention to bring about the commission of acts of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination or an imminent risk of such acts occurring as a consequence of the particular hate speech used intent to incite might be established where there is an unambiguous call by the person using hate speech for others to commit the relevant acts or it might be inferred from the strength of the language used and other relevant circumstances such as the previous conduct of the speaker however the existence of intent may not always be easy to demonstrate particularly where remarks are ostensibly concerned with supposed facts or coded language is being used see paragraph above in the courts view the applicant was prosecuted in relation to the type of incitement mentioned above and his conviction was based on the consideration that his actions had been intended to incite violence article of the criminal code did not appear to require any assessment of a risk of harmful consequences it being sufficient to establish a defendants direct intent and his or her actual aim to incite to call others to carry out extremist activities that is in the present case to induce ethnic discord and to violate the rights of people of non russian ethnicities both by way of violent actions against them see paragraph above the finding of guilt was based on two considerationsa the finding that the thirdparty content contained calls to violence aiming at inciting ethnic discord and at violating rights and freedoms of non russian ethnic groups because of their ethnicity andb a number of indications relating to the applicants attitude toward that content the applicant choosing to remain silent during the criminal proceedings to assess the weight of ones interest in the exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression the court must first examine the nature of his or her statements see perinçek cited above the relevant question is whether the statements belonged to a type of expression entitled to heightened or reduced protection under article of the convention which is ultimately for the court to decide while having regard to the findings of the domestic courts in this regard see for instance satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above bédat cited above and herbai v hungary no november under the courts caselaw expression on matters of public interest is in principle entitled to stronger protection whereas expression that promotes or justifies violence hatred xenophobia or another form of intolerance can not normally claim protection see perinçek the risk of harm posed by content and communications on the internet to the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and freedoms may be higher than that posed by the press as unlawful speech including hate speech and calls to violence can be disseminated as never before worldwide in a matter of seconds and sometimes remain persistently available online see delfi as v estonia gc no and echr at the same time the reach and thus potential impact of a statement released online with a small readership or as the case may be online followership on socialmedia platforms and a statement published on mainstream or highly visited web pages may differ it may be pertinent for the assessment of a potential influence of an online publication to determine the scope of its reach to the public see savva terentyev v russia no august the court also considers that the sharing of thirdparty content online through socialmedia platforms is a frequent way of communication and social interaction and that it does not always pursue any specific communicative aim or aims especially where a person does not accompany it with any comment or otherwise signify his or her attitude toward the content the court does not exclude that such act of sharing certain content still can contribute to an informed citizenry in the domestic proceedings the applicant chose to remain silent before the court he took no stance relating to his involvement in and motivation for making the impugned material available through the vk account however he insisted that prosecution for a quotation from a work of art which was not banned could not be compatible with article of the convention the domestic courts established that the applicant had expressed interest in what could be described as nationalist ideas the applicant did not challenge this finding at the national level or before the court the conduct held against the applicant consisted in his having made available to others video and audio files that had been uploaded onto his personal vk account there is no indication that those acts were accompanied by any statement for instance uncovering the applicants attitude toward the impugned material relying on the expert report the appellate court considered that the applicants communicative intent consisted in calling to violence aiming at ethnic discord and at violating non russians rights and freedoms the appellate court also relied on the fact that the uploading of the video had been followed by the uploading of similar content in the form of an audio recording witness statements suggesting that the applicant had had some interest in nationalist ideas and a wiretapped telephone conversation between the applicant and another person see paragraph above it has not been argued and the court has no reason to consider that by uploading the impugned material to his vk account and making it accessible to other users the applicant contributed or at least intended to contribute to any debate on a matter of public interest compare atamanchuk cited above the court notes that the video showed a man dressed as an elderly woman expressing xenophobic and racist views and acting upon them being incited by another person acting as a supporter of socalled nationalist or neo nazi ideas the only evident element concerns the fact that the video had the title russia granny this title corresponded to the title of a cinematographic work entitled russia as acknowledged by both the experts in the criminal case and the applicant that film was wellknown in russia see paragraphs and above and the annex to this judgment below it is also uncontested that the film could be classified as a mockumentary the experts considered that the impugned oneminute excerpt was a semantically complete scene filmed in this genre and represented within the films plot the process of filming a propaganda video the court reiterates that satire is a form of artistic expression and social commentary which by its inherent features of exaggeration and distortion of reality naturally aims to provoke and agitate accordingly any interference with the right of an artist or anyone else to use this means of expression should be examined with particular care see eon v france no march and cases cited therein it has not been claimed and the court has no reason to consider that the applicants act of sharing the impugned video was intended as a means of his own artistic expression or satirical social commentary at the same time the court notes that the films message was no longer apparent in any manner or form the video being presented in isolation from the overall context of the film and without any context or commentary in the courts view an ordinary viewer could be mistaken as to the message of the video that it was to mock propaganda techniques with a racist agenda rather than to put forward that racist agenda and to demonstrate a way to pursue it the court accepts the national courts finding that the video could be reasonably perceived as stirring up ethnic discord by calling for violence against people of azerbaijani origin and as calling for violating their rights by violent actions as regards the audio it has not been contested and the court accepts that it could be reasonably perceived as stirring up ethnic discord by calling for violence against people of non russian ethnicities and as calling for violating their rights by violent actions the manner and the immediate context in which the applicant disseminated that thirdparty content do not prompt the court to reach a different conclusion in the present case in view of the foregoing considerations and given the racist nature of the material and the absence of any commentary on such content the court doubts that the applicants exercise of his freedom to impart information and ideas had any appreciable socially redeeming value in the specific circumstances of the case when finding the applicant guilty of the criminal offence of intentional calls to ethnic discord by violent actions and violation of the rights of others by violent actions the domestic courts convincingly established the applicants criminal intent visàvis that content compare mbala mbala v france dec no echr extracts and nikowitz and verlagsgruppe news gmb h v austria no february specifically the court considers that the domestic courts convincingly demonstrated that the impugned material incited ethnic discord between russian people and people of non russian ethnic origin azerbaijanis as for the video and foremost the applicants clear intention to bring about the commission of related acts of hatred or intolerance the material was uploaded to a socialnetworking website that was accessible at the time through the internet the appellate court stated that a large audience could watch the video and listen to the audio it transpires from the witness statements made at the national level that access to that material depended on the account users acceptance of those witnesses as friends of the account thereby granting them access to its content see paragraphs and above some fifty people could have accessed that material at the time of the events under examination the applicant does not appear to have been a wellknown or popular user of social media see magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no echr or a public or influential figure contrast osmani and others v the former yugoslav republic of macedonia dec no october and féret cited above which could have attracted public attention to the material and thus have enhanced its potential harmful impact having said this the court does not exclude that the sharing of such content in such a manner within an online group even a relatively small one of likeminded persons may have the effect of reinforcing and radicalising their ideas without being exposed to any critical discussion or different views the court also notes that there is no indication in the decisions of the domestic courts that the material was published against a sensitive social or political background or that at the relevant time the general security situation in russia was tense or that there were any clashes disturbances or interethnic riots or that there existed an atmosphere of hostility and hatred towards the non russian ethnic groups in particular those of the azerbaijani ethnic origin or any other particular circumstances in which that material was liable to produce imminent unlawful actions in respect of azerbaijanis or other ethnic groups and to expose them to a real threat of physical violence the domestic courts did not refer to any factors or context which would show that the applicants actions could have actually encouraged violence and thus put those groups or any of its members at risk however the court considers that the abovementioned elements are not decisive in the present case the court has found that the domestic courts reasoning based on the applicants criminal intent can be regarded as both relevant and sufficient in the present case to justify his prosecution for a criminal offence for a call for ethnic discord through violence lastly the court reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no echr xi the court considers that the suspended eighteenmonth term of imprisonment with a similar period of probation and some other requirements see paragraph above was proportionate in the specific circumstances of the case compare pastörs cited above stomakhin cited above and sinkova v ukraine no february there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention having reached this conclusion the court finds it unnecessary to delve into whether article should be applied in the present case see in the same vein atamanchuk cited above alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that the appeal hearing in his criminal case had been held in camera article in the relevant parts reads as follows in the determination of any criminal charge against him everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals public order or national security in a democratic society where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice admissibility the government stated that the present application which included the complaint under article of the convention had to be dismissed with reference to article of the convention however they made no related argument as regards article in relation to the applicants right to a public hearing the applicant made no specific comment in that regard having regard to its caselaw see varela geis v spain no and march the court does not find it appropriate to declare the complaint incompatible ratione materiae the court also notes that this complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merits the applicant made no observations on the present complaint the government stated that the appellate court had provided reasons for disallowing the publics presence and that the cassationinstance court had confirmed that the decision to hold the appeal hearing in camera had been justified see paragraphs and above the court notes at the outset that the applicant did not allege that the appeal decision had not been pronounced publicly the complaint before the court is limited to holding the appeal hearing in camera that is to the exclusion of the press and public from it the court also notes that the applicant has not substantiated in which manner that decision adversely affected the equality of arms and adversarial procedure in the criminal case it is noted that the appeal court held an oral hearing at which the parties were present and made submissions the court reiterates that the public character of proceedings before the judicial bodies referred to in article protects litigants against the administration of justice in secret with no public scrutiny it is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts superior and inferior can be maintained by rendering the administration of justice visible publicity contributes to the achievement of the aim of article namely a fair trial the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society within the meaning of the convention see martinie v france gc no echr vi the exclusion of the press and public from all or part of the trial may be compatible with article in the light of the special features of the case and in the interests of morals public order or national security in a democratic society where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice holding proceedings whether wholly or partly in camera must be strictly necessary in that last situation mentioned above and in any event must be strictly required by the circumstances of the case in respect of the other situations listed above ibid olujić v croatia no february welke and białek v poland no march and chaushev and others v russia nos and others october it has not been contested and the court does not rule out that safety considerations relating to a threat to ones physical integrity could fall within the scope of at least one of the legitimate interests mentioned above nor was it in dispute that such type of measure as the exclusion of the press and public from a court hearing could be tailored to deal with that kind of considerations it appears that under russian law the exclusion of the press and public from a court hearing was also considered as one of the protective measures in that context where there was sufficient information confirming the existence of threats to inter alia the physical integrity of a crime victim a witness or another person participating in the criminal proceedings or their next of kin see paragraphs above having said this the court is not satisfied that the decision to hold the appeal hearing in camera was shown to have been strictly required on account of the mere fact that the type of offence for which the applicant stood trial was prescribed in the chapter of the code of criminal procedure concerning offences against the foundations of the constitutional regime and national security nor was this fact per se sufficient for deducing that the safety of unspecified persons that participated or were going to participate in the appeal hearing was at stake the factual and legal elements of the specific charge against the applicant concerned dissemination of material that allegedly incited or could incite social racial or ethnic discord the procedural decision issued by the appeal court contained no further factual elements or legal arguments for justifying the hearing in camera in this connection the court also notes that the justice of the peace held a public hearing without any safety considerations being raised the appeal courts decision did not point out any circumstances namely relating to the physical safety of any witnesses or the like that justified the hearing in camera at the appellate stage of the proceedings the court also notes that the cassationinstance court considered that the applicants procedural rights had not been violated on account of the appeal hearing in camera indicating that the justice of the peace had held a public hearing at which the evidence submitted by the parties had been examined the defence had not appealed against the decision to hold the appeal hearing in camera and in their cassation appeal did not submit convincing arguments to the effect that the appeal hearing in camera had significantly impinged upon the defences rights in so far as the presentation of evidence had been concerned see paragraph above the court reiterates however that while the overall fairness of the proceedings is the overarching principle under article of the convention see jussila v finland gc no echr xiv the nonviolation of the defendants right to a public hearing visàvis the exclusion of the public and the press does not necessarily correlate with the existence of any actual damage to the defendants exercise of his other procedural rights including those protected under paragraph of article thus even assuming the applicant was otherwise afforded an adequate opportunity to put forward a defence in the appeal proceedings with due regard to his right to an oral hearing and the principles of equality of arms and adversarial procedure it remains the fact that it was not shown that the decision to hold the appeal hearing in camera had been strictly required in the circumstances of the present case namely for ensuring the safety of any person participating in that hearing nor does the court consider that the examination of the case by the justice of the peace at a public hearing could entail the conclusion that article of the convention was complied with in the present case in so far as the applicants right to a public hearing on appeal was concerned the government have not argued and the court does not consider that it was appropriate to dispense with an oral and thus public hearing on appeal because the applicant had already had one at first instance the court notes in this connection that after an oral hearing the appeal court set aside the trial judgment and issued a new one convicting the applicant the court concludes that the exclusion of the press and public from the appeal hearing was not justified lastly the court previously held that a complete reexamination of the criminal case by a higherinstance court in compliance with the requirements of article of the convention could have the effect of redressing the procedural shortcomings before the lower courts see idalov v russia gc no may and did not rule out that a similar approach could apply to the right to a public hearing on account of the exclusion of the press and public from a court hearing see izmestyev v russia no august and cases cited therein neither the cassationinstance court nor the government before the court argued that the alleged violation of the applicants right to a public hearing on appeal had been redressed in the cassationinstance proceedings before the regional court in any event while it appears that there was an oral hearing before the regional court there is no indication that it was a public one see paragraph above or that the regional court proceeded with the complete reexamination of the criminal case there has therefore been a violation of article of the convention application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court finds that there has been a violation of the convention or the protocols thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party damage the applicant claimed euros eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage the government considered that the claim was excessive the court awards the applicant eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage plus any tax that may be chargeable costs and expenses the applicant made no claim on this account the court thus makes no award default interest the court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the european central bank to which should be added three percentage points for these reasons the court unanimouslydecides to join to the merits under article of the convention the governments argument under article of the convention declares the complaints under article and article of the convention admissible holds that there has been a violation of article of the convention holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention holds that it is not necessary to examine whether article of the convention should be applied holdsa that the respondent state is to pay the applicant within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with article of the convention eur one thousand five hundred euros plus any tax that may be chargeable in respect of nonpecuniary damage to be converted into russian roubles at the rate applicable at the date of settlementb that from the expiry of the abovementioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage points dismisses the remainder of the

22,the applicant was born in and lives in kyiv at the time of the events she belonged to an artistic group called the st luke brotherhood which was known for its provocative public performances on december the applicant together with three other members of the abovementioned union made what she described as an act of performance which according to both parties accounts consisted of the following they went to the eternal glory memorial to those who perished in the second world war which contained the tombs of thirtytwo soldiers including that of an unknown soldier the applicant took a frying pan prepared in advance broke some eggs into it and fried them over the eternal flame at the tomb of the unknown soldier two of her friends joined her and fried sausages on skewers over the flame another member of the group filmed the event two police officers approached them and made a remark that their behaviour was inappropriate without further interference on the same day the applicant posted the video on the internet on behalf of the st luke brotherhood it was accompanied by the following statement precious natural gas has been being burned pointlessly at the glory memorial in kyiv for fiftythree years now this pleasure costs taxpayers about hryvnias uah per month and this is only one eternal flame pagan temple whereas there are hundreds or even thousands of them throughout ukraine on december the st luke brotherhood reacted to this by an act of protest in the glory park in the capital it showed that people should use the eternal flame we suggest to the outraged representatives of the communist party of ukraine to follow the example of ancient roman vestal virgins and to carry out aroundtheclock duty at the eternal flames keeping the fire lit manually by wood there is no doubt that communists will have no problems with fulfilling this task because they already have experience of taking care of the lenin monument in kyiv and their financing is much better than that which the vestal virgins had while the parties did not provide a copy of the video in question to the court it was possible to view it on several publicly available websites in addition to the factual account from the parties summarised above the court notes that the soundtrack to the video was a famous soviet song the battle is going on again devoted to the victory of the revolution and optimism about the future of the communist regime the video started with the following opening titles the st luke brotherhood presents recipe of the day eternal fried eggs on the eternal flame the participants in the performance did not make any public address and their conversation was not audible they had no posters or other visual aids apart from the food and cooking utensils it could be seen on the video that once the applicant had broken the eggs in the frying pan and was about to approach the fire while her friends held skewers with sausages the two police officers appeared and the applicant explained something to them and they left in order to reach the flame the applicant had to step over a sculpture of a wreath of oak leaves and step on the words glory to the unknown soldier there were several complaints to the police that the action on the video had amounted to desecration of the tomb of the unknown soldier and called for criminal prosecution on december the police questioned d one of the women who had participated in the performance she submitted that she had not known the other members of the group and that she had met them by chance as they had allegedly explained to her they had been hungry and had intended to cook food in order to eat it on the same day criminal proceedings were instituted against d and three unidentified persons on suspicion of hooliganism on december d wrote a confession that she had participated in a protest against inappropriate use of natural gas and that she regretted it she knew only the first names of the other participants on december another criminal case was opened against her and three unidentified persons in respect of the same event this time on suspicion of desecration of a tomb it was joined to that opened earlier subsequently the charge of hooliganism was dropped the police retrieved photos of several persons who might have been involved in the incident from the passport offices database and showed them to d she recognised the applicant on february the investigator questioned the applicants grandmother and mother who lived at the address of the applicants registered residence they submitted that they knew nothing about her involvement in the event in question they also stated that the applicant did not in fact live there and denied knowing her whereabouts or having her contact details they only knew that she had left for western ukraine without further details the grandmother stated that the applicant had visited her about two weeks earlier the applicants mother had seen her about a week earlier and had received a telephone call from her two days earlier on february the investigator severed the criminal case in respect of the applicant and two unidentified persons on suspicion of desecration of the tomb of the unknown soldier by a group following a prior conspiracy on the same day the applicant was declared wanted by the police on march the investigator applied to the pecherskyy district court of kyiv the pecherskyy court for the applicants detention as a preventive measure pending trial his arguments were as follows the offence of which the applicant was suspected was punishable by a prison term of more than three years the applicant had absconded as a result of which she had been declared wanted by the police and she could reoffend or hinder the establishment of the truth if at liberty on march a judge of the pecherskyy court allowed that application in part he ordered the applicants arrest with a view to bringing her before the court for examination on march at pm the applicant was arrested at the flat of a certain z in kyiv as the latter subsequently stated during her questioning the applicant had been living there from march at the request of an acquaintance on march the applicant was questioned as an accused in the presence of her lawyer while insisting that her only intention had been to protest against the inappropriate use of natural gas she confessed to the offence and expressed remorse on the same day the investigator once again applied to the pecherskyy court for the applicants detention as a preventive measure his reasoning was the same as before on march and april two deputies of the kyiv regional council applied to the pecherskyy court for the applicants release in exchange of their personal guarantee of her adequate procedural behaviour on april the pecherskyy court remanded the applicant in custody as a preventive measure pending trial it noted that she was accused of a serious offence punishable by imprisonment of from three to five years furthermore the judge referred to the fact that the applicant had absconded and had therefore been put on the wanted list it was also considered that she might hinder establishing the truth if at liberty in so far as the applicants lawyer relied on her positive character references from various sources the court noted that those could not guarantee her compliance with all the procedural requirements while having noted that the applicant also relied on the letters of personal guarantee from the peoples deputies the judge did not further comment on them it was specified in the ruling that the term of the applicants detention was to be calculated from march under the applicable legislation the duration of pretrial detention was limited to two months with the possibility of further extensions the applicants lawyer appealed he submitted that his client was willing to cooperate with the investigation and that there were no reasons for her detention it was further pointed out in the appeal that the applicant had been declared wanted by the police on the very same day the criminal case against her had been opened the lawyer noted that there had not been a single summons sent by the investigation to the applicants address prior to her arrest according to her she had found out about the charge against her only on the day of her arrest on march lastly the lawyer submitted that the firstinstance court had not considered any less intrusive preventive measures as an alternative to detention and that it had left without consideration the people deputies letters of guarantee on april the kyiv city court of appeal rejected the above appeal it noted that the pecherskyy court had already duly examined all the arguments raised in it on may the applicant was indicted on the same day the case was sent to the pecherskyy court for trial on june the applicant applied to the court for release under an undertaking not to abscond she submitted that she enjoyed positive character references had no criminal record and had cooperated with the investigation furthermore the applicant observed that by that time the investigation had already been completed and could not therefore be hampered she emphasised that her actions had been nothing else than a protest driven by good motives several members of parliament and other prominent figures joined her in that application and expressed their wish to act as her personal guarantors on june the pecherskyy court held a preparatory hearing during which it rejected the applicants application for release with reference to the seriousness of the charge against her the nature and the circumstances of the offence of which she was accused as well as the fact that she had been declared wanted by the police the judge also stated in general terms that there were no grounds for the applicants release under a personal guarantee on june the applicant applied once again to be released on the same day the pecherskyy court allowed that application and released her under an undertaking not to leave the town on october the pecherskyy court found the applicant guilty of the desecration of the tomb of the unknown soldier acting as part of a group of persons following a prior conspiracy the court noted that the applicant had convinced d and two other people whose identities remained unestablished to carry out a performance at the eternal glory memorial aimed at protesting against the waste of natural gas caused by the burning of the eternal flame d who was questioned in court confirmed that account of events the court also questioned the memorial keeper who had witnessed the performance from a distance and the two police officers who had spoken to the applicant and her friends see paragraph above furthermore the court examined the videorecording of the performance as material evidence the judgment mentioned the statement made by the applicant during the hearing that in her opinion people bringing flowers to the memorial did not really understand what exactly it was dedicated to she insisted that she had not committed any crime as her performance had not been meant to desecrate the tomb of the unknown soldier furthermore she maintained that there could not be a tomb beneath the eternal flame because of the gas pipe the pecherskyy court held that the applicants arguments had no impact on the legal classification of her actions and that they were refuted by the evidence as a whole the judgment further stated in that regard the court considers that by committing deliberate acts in a group which showed disrespect for the burial place of the unknown soldier and for the public tradition of honouring the memory of soldiers who perished defending or liberating kyiv and the lands of ukraine from the fascist hordes and by subsequently presenting those actions as a protest the applicant has tried to escape social condemnation of her conduct and criminal liability for the offence relying on local authority documents the court dismissed the applicants submission that there was no established location for the tomb of the unknown soldier the court did not discern any aggravating or mitigating circumstances in the case at the same time in deciding on the penalty it took into account on the one hand the fact that the applicant did not have a criminal record that she was working as a political analyst and got positive character references by her place of residence and work on the other hand the court noted that the criminal offence in question was of medium gravity and that the applicant did not show any remorse for what she had done as a result she was sentenced to three years imprisonment suspended for two years on the same date the pecherskyy court exempted d from criminal liability under the surety of her employer the applicant appealed relying on the definition of the desecration of a burial place under the burial and funeral business act see paragraph below she maintained that in the absence of any intention by her to defile the family or social memory of a deceased or to show contempt for a burial place or social and religious principles and traditions there were no constituent elements of a crime in her actions the applicant reiterated her argument that her performance had been nothing more than a protest lastly she submitted that the criminal proceedings against her had violated her right to freedom of expression under article of the convention the prosecutor also appealed considering the sentence to be too lenient on december the kyiv city court of appeal upheld the judgment of the firstinstance court it stated that desecration of a tomb could have different expressions indicating an insulting attitude mockery or disrespect towards a tomb or the person buried therein regardless of the stated motives as regards the applicants argument on her right to freedom of expression the court noted that that right was not unlimited and that the restriction in the applicants case was in accordance with the law and pursued a legitimate aim the appellate court also rejected the prosecutors appeal the applicant further reiterated her arguments in an appeal on points of law lodged by her which was however rejected by the higher specialised court for civil and criminal matters on april ii relevant domestic law and practicea applicable legislation and relevant legal opinions article of the constitution of ukraine provides that international treaties which are in force and agreed on as binding by the verkhovna rada parliament of ukraine are part of the national legislation article of the constitution enshrining the right to freedom of expression can be found in the courts judgment in the case of lykin v ukraine no january the relevant provisions of the code of criminal procedure of in force and as worded at the material time concerning preventive measures are quoted in particular in the courts judgment in the case of strogan v ukraine no october article of the criminal code of as amended on march read as follows desecration of a tomb or other

list when imposing a penalty under article a court may impose a more lenient penalty than that envisaged by law subject to several mitigating circumstances reducing the gravity of the offence and having regard to the offenders character the scientific and practical commentary on the criminal code of ukraine науковопрактичний коментар кримінального кодексу україни ме вид перероблене та доповнене за ред мі мельника та мі хавронюка київ юридична думка states in respect of article in particular as follows the object target of the crime is the moral foundations of society as regards respect towards the dead and their burial places this crime causes nonpecuniary damage in particular to those who are close to the deceased it violates public order can entail interethnic and interconfessional conflict and has a negative impact on the education of teenagers the attitude of people towards the dead is probably one of the most telling illustrations of the difference between civilisation and savagery which also reflects a persons attitude to other social values the actus reus of the criminal offence is desecration of a tomb or other burial place desecration is an insulting attitude brutal mockery or a demonstration of contempt towards a burial place or the ashes of the deceased the law does not specify the ways in which desecration can be committed it could be profanation including the placing of indecent inscriptions or drawings or soiling the tomb with excrement the destruction of sepulchral constructions the excavation of burial places corpse dissection or destruction or tearing off its clothing desecration is characterised by an objective element that is the commission of certain acts in respect of a deceased or a burial place and by a subjective element that is realising that those acts amount to contempt for the memory of the deceased which violate the principles of public life in that area most often desecration takes the form of an action however it can not be ruled out that it could stem from an omission for example not interfering with the behaviour of domestic animals digging into a tomb or relieving themselves on it the mens rea of the crime is characterised by guilt in the form of intent the guilty person realises that heshe a is committing an infringement in relation to a tomb other burial place or a corpse b foresees that hisher actions will cause moral suffering to others and violate the moral foundations of society in respect of attitudes to the dead c wishes to show hisher contempt for the memory of the deceased and to demonstrate hisher negative attitude towards the public principles prevailing in that area that is acts of direct intention or is conscious of such an assumption that is acts of indirect intention this crime is classified as aggravated if it has been committed following a prior conspiracy by a group of persons for hooligan motives hooligan motives arise where the guilty person wishes to demonstrate hisher contempt for the generally recognised norms and rules of peoples attitudes towards the dead and their burial places boasts of hisher pseudobravery or seeks to assert himselfherself in the eyes of surrounding people by humiliating others and their feelings in other words they are motives which are considered from the viewpoint of public morality as disgraceful and ignoble aiming to create conflict between an individual and society hooligan motives also stem from racial ethnic or religious intolerance different approaches to assessing historical events and so on in respect of a tomb of an unknown soldier a tomb of an unknown soldier is a military memorial dedicated to those who perished in an armed conflict it includes the place of burial itself and a memorial sign soldier is a generic term referring to any military official officer sailor or lawenforcement agent who died in action or in armed conflict it does not matter on whose side the deceased participated in the events leading to their deaths nor is it of relevance how society or particular individuals assess the respective wars or other social cataclysms and the role of participants in them section of the burial and funeral business act of with further amendments defines the desecration of a tomb or other burial place as follows the placing of unauthorised inscriptions drawings symbols or other images at cemetery facilities designated for burial and commemoration ceremonies on sepulchral constructions vaults urns with ashes tombs and other burial places wilfully damaging the excavation demolition or destruction by other means of cemetery facilities designated for burial and commemoration ceremonies sepulchral constructions vaults urns with ashes tombs and other burial places the use of cemetery facilities designated for burial and commemoration ceremonies sepulchral constructions vaults urns with ashes tombs and other burial places for a purpose not envisaged by the legislation in force their unauthorised use or the commission of any other acts intended to defile the family or public memory of the deceased or to show contempt for the burial place or the social and religious principles and traditions in that area under section of the law persons guilty of desecrating a tomb or other burial place are held liable in accordance with the law under the law on the procedure for the compensation of damage caused to citizens by the unlawful actions of bodies in charge of operational enquiries pretrial investigation authorities prosecutors or courts of as worded at the material time also known as the compensation act a person was entitled to compensation for damage on account of in particular unlawful detention section a precondition for the entitlement to compensation was a finding of unlawfulness of arrest and detention in a guilty verdict or other judicial decision section b caselaw of domestic courts cited by the applicant the applicant submitted to the court copies of seven judgments delivered by local courts on various dates between and by which people had been found guilty of desecrating tombs after taking metal parts and trading them as scrap the sentences were as follows from the most lenient to the harshest two years restriction of liberty suspended for two years three years restriction of liberty suspended for one year one year and six months restriction of liberty one year and six months imprisonment suspended for one year three years imprisonment suspended for two years and six months three years imprisonment and three years and six months imprisonment iii relevant international texts the summary of the position of the supreme court of the united states of america in respect of the controversial conduct of cross burning as formulated in its decision on the case of virginia v black can be found in the courts judgment in the case of fáber v hungary no july the lawi alleged violations of article of the convention the applicant complained that her initial arrest and subsequent detention had been in breach of article and of the convention the provisions relied on read as follows in the relevant parts everyone has the right to liberty and security of person no one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by lawc the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph c of this article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this article shall have an enforceable right to compensation a admissibility the court notes that these complaints are not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds they must therefore be declared admissible b merits alleged violation of article of the conventiona the parties submissions the applicant argued that there had been neither any legal basis nor practical need for her arrest given the vague wording of article of the criminal code it was far from obvious that her actions amounted to desecration of a tomb accordingly her arrest could not be regarded as based on a reasonable suspicion that she had committed a crime the applicant next contended that she had never absconded as she had been nineteen years old she had been free not to live with her parents or grandparents she considered that there had been no genuine attempt by the investigation to contact her before declaring her wanted by the police thus according to her it had been open for the investigator to contact her as the author of the video in question via the indicated site in the alternative he could have asked the applicants relatives or friends for her email address furthermore as she had been a university student she could have easily been reached through her university contacts lastly the investigator could have summonsed her through her mother or grandmother however none of those actions had been undertaken furthermore the applicant complained that her detention from may to june had not been covered by any judicial decision the government maintained that the applicants arrest had been in compliance with national legislation and accompanied by all the requisite safeguards they argued that the authorities had had good reasons to believe that she had been absconding given the fact that she had not been living at her registered address and her whereabouts had not been known the government further submitted that the arrest order with a view to bringing the applicant to court had been aimed at ensuring compliance with the equalityofarms principle and enabling her to respond to the investigators arguments lastly as regards the particular period of the applicants pretrial detention from may to june the government observed that it had been based on the applicable legal provisions and could not be regarded arbitraryb the courts assessmenti general caselaw principles the court reiterates that in order to comply with article the detention in issue must first of all be lawful including the observance of a procedure prescribed by law in this respect the convention refers back essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof it requires in addition however that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of article namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness furthermore the detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is only justified where other less severe measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained that means that it does not suffice that the deprivation of liberty is in conformity with national law it must also be necessary in the circumstances see hadžimejlić and others v bosnia and herzegovina nos and others november with further referencesii application of the above principles to the present caseα lawfulness of the applicants arrest in assessing the lawfulness of the applicants arrest the court attaches weight firstly to the fact it was based on a judicial order and secondly to the limited scope of that order which was aimed at ensuring her presence at the hearing with a view to examination of the investigators application for her detention as regards the necessity of that measure in the circumstances the court notes that one of the main reasons for the applicants arrest was the fact that she had been declared wanted by the police the court has held in its caselaw that the mere fact of being on a wanted list does not mean that the person has gone into hiding the important factor in measuring the risk of absconding is the actual behaviour of the suspect and not his formal status as a person on a wanted list see yevgeniy gusev v russia no december the court is not convinced by the applicants argument that the decision to put her on a wanted list was hasty and unnecessary and that the police had not made sufficient efforts to contact her it is not in dispute that her actual whereabouts were unknown to the police her family members living at the address of her registered residence denied having that information when questioned on february it is unclear how the police could have been more efficient in their attempts to reach her by email or through her university contacts even less convincing is the applicants suggestion that she could have been directly contacted as the author of the video on the internet given that her identity had first to be established through investigation see for example paragraph above the court also has doubts as regards the applicants submission that she had not been aware of the criminal proceedings against her until her arrest on march as confirmed by the casefile material she was in touch with her family members who had been questioned by the police on february in respect of her involvement in the incident under investigation accordingly having regard to all the circumstances of the present case the court does not see any indication of unlawfulness or arbitrariness as regards the applicants arrest there has therefore been no violation of article of the convention in this regardβ lawfulness of the applicants detention from may to june the court observes that the applicants detention which had been ordered by the judicial decision of april expired on may meanwhile on may the case had been referred to the firstinstance court for trial on june the pecherskyy court held its preparatory hearing at which it ordered the applicants further detention as a preventive measure it follows that her detention between may and june was not covered by any judicial decision the court has already found a violation of article of the convention in a number of cases concerning the practice of holding defendants in custody solely on the basis of the fact that a bill of indictment has been submitted to the trial court it has held that the practice of keeping defendants in detention without a specific legal basis or clear rules governing their situation with the result that they may be deprived of their liberty for an unlimited period without judicial authorisation is incompatible with the principles of legal certainty and the protection from arbitrariness which are common threads throughout the convention and the rule of law see for example yeloyev v ukraine no november the court has also concluded that this issue seemed to stem from a legislative lacuna in ukraine see kharchenko v ukraine no and february having regard to its wellestablished caselaw the court finds that there has been a violation of article of the convention in respect of the applicants detention from may to june alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that her continued pretrial detention had been unjustified the government contended that it had been based on relevant and sufficient reasons they observed that once that preventive measure had no longer been required the applicant had been released under an undertaking not to abscond the court notes that the applicants pretrial detention in the present case lasted from march to june that is to say for three months the court reiterates that the issue of whether a period of detention is reasonable can not be assessed in abstracto this must be assessed in each case according to its special features the reasons given in the domestic decisions and the welldocumented matters referred to by the applicant in his applications for release continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which notwithstanding the presumption of innocence outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty see among others labita v italy gc no echr iv turning to the present case the court observes that in extending the applicants detention and rejecting her applications for release the domestic courts mainly referred to the reasoning for her initial placement in detention without any updated details furthermore no consideration seemed to be given to the numerous letters of personal guarantee in support of her release at no stage in the period under consideration did the domestic courts consider applying any alternative preventive measures and by relying essentially on the seriousness of the charge and the hypothetical risk of the applicants absconding the authorities maintained her detention on grounds which can not be regarded as sufficient the court notes that eventually on june the applicant was released under an undertaking not to leave the town in the courts opinion this or a less intrusive preventive measure could have been applied to her earlier at least the reasons given by the domestic courts in justifying her continued detention did not suggest any indication to the contrary the foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the court to conclude that there has been a violation of article of the convention alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that under the existing legislation she could not claim compensation in respect of the breach of her rights under article and of the convention the government submitted that the ukrainian legislation provided for the possibility to claim compensation for unlawful detention subject to a judicial decision acknowledging such unlawfulness it was not however applicable to the circumstances of the present case because the applicants detention had been lawful the court reiterates that article guarantees an enforceable right to compensation to those who have been the victims of arrest or detention in contravention of the other provisions of article see stanev v bulgaria gc no january with further references and lelyuk v ukraine no november in the present case the court has found a violation of article and in conjunction with which the present complaint is to be examined it follows that article of the convention is applicable the court must therefore establish whether ukrainian law afforded or now affords the applicant an enforceable right to compensation for that violation in her case the court observes that the issue of compensation for unlawful detention is regulated in ukraine by the compensation act the right to compensation arises in particular where the unlawfulness of the detention has been established by a judicial decision see paragraph above the court notes that as long as the applicants detention is in formal compliance with the domestic legislation it is impossible for her to claim compensation in that regard at the national level furthermore there is no legally envisaged procedure in ukraine for bringing proceedings to seek compensation for the deprivation of liberty found to be in breach of one of the other paragraphs by the strasbourg court see nechiporuk and yonkalo v ukraine no april this means that one of the principles of article namely that the effective enjoyment of the right to compensation guaranteed by it must be ensured with a sufficient degree of certainty see stanev cited above does not appear to have been met in the present case there has therefore been a violation of article of the convention ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained of a violation of her right to freedom of expression although she relied on articles and of the convention the court considers it appropriate to examine her complaint only under article which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court notes that this complaint is neither manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention nor inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissionsa the applicant the applicant submitted that she had protested against wasteful use of natural gas and had tried to attract public attention to that issue in her opinion the funds used for maintaining eternal flames throughout the country would better serve their purpose if used to improve the living standards of war veterans she emphasised that in no case she had meant to insult the memory of the dead or demonstrate a disrespectful attitude towards the tomb the applicant observed that she had neither damaged the memorial nor breached public order she also drew the courts attention to the fact that she had not tried to conceal her actions to the contrary she had immediately posted the video on the internet the applicants lawyers further stated her position as follows the applicant believes that any impartial individual who would watch the abovementioned video and who would familiarise himself with the statement of the st luke brotherhood would understand that the applicant performed an act that was intended to protest against the wasteful upkeep of the eternal flame and was not an expression of contempt to the gravesite the applicant next argued that there was no conclusive evidence that the tomb of the unknown soldier was located exactly beneath the eternal flame on which she had fried eggs overall the applicant considered that she had wrongly been convicted of a criminal offence which she had not committed she argued that the interference with her right to freedom of expression could not be regarded as lawful given the lack of clarity in the definition of that offence in the criminal code as regards the definition of desecration of a tomb under the law on burial and funeral business the applicant contended that it did attribute weight to the existence of respective criminal intentions such as to defile the family or public memory of the deceased or to manifest contempt towards the burial place the social and religious principles and traditions in this area see paragraph above however she maintained no such intentions from her side had ever been established the applicant also submitted in broad terms that the judicial decisions taken in her case ran contrary to the established jurisprudence on the subject she cited in that regard several domestic judgments on tomb desecration cases see paragraph above furthermore the applicant maintained that her criminal conviction had not pursued any legitimate aim according to her its sole purpose was to punish her for the expression of her views the applicant also argued that the impugned interference had not been necessary in a democratic society given that the performance had already taken place and had not led to any negative consequences for anybodyb the government the government accepted that there had been an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression but argued that it had been in compliance with paragraph of article of the convention they contended that article of the criminal code under which the applicant had been convicted was worded with sufficient precision as stated therein desecration of a tomb could consist of different actions and the motives behind were not essential in the governments opinion there were no reasons to doubt that the applicants actions amounted to desecration of the tomb of the unknown soldier they noted that the eternal flame on which the applicant had fried eggs was a part of the memorial comprising thirtytwo tombs of soldiers who had lost their lives during the second world war it was a sacred and symbolic place where every year war veterans gathered to commemorate their fallen comrades accordingly the government maintained that regardless of her stated motives the applicants action had demonstrated disrespect and mockery and had been insulting for veterans and for those whose relatives had perished during the war the government therefore argued that the applicants conviction had pursued a legitimate aim namely protection of morals and others rights as to whether it was necessary in a democratic society the government drew the courts attention to the fact that the applicants prison sentence had been suspended accordingly the interference with her rights under article could not be regarded as disproportionate to the aim pursued the courts assessment it is not in dispute that there has been an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression in the present case it remains to be seen whether that interference was prescribed by law pursued a legitimate aim and was necessary in a democratic societya prescribed by law according to the courts caselaw the expression prescribed by law entails in particular a requirement of foreseeability a norm can not be regarded as a law unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the person concerned to regulate his or her conduct he or she needed to be able if need be with appropriate advice to foresee to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances the consequences that a given action could entail however the court has held that these consequences do not need to be foreseeable with absolute certainty as experience showed that to be unattainable even in cases in which the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression had taken the form of a criminal penalty the court has recognised the impossibility of attaining absolute precision in the framing of laws especially in fields in which the situation changes according to the prevailing views of society and has accepted that the need to avoid rigidity and keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are couched in terms which are to some extent vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice see for example perinçek v switzerland gc no and echr extracts with further references in the present case the applicant was criminally prosecuted for desecrating the tomb of the unknown soldier under article of the criminal code see paragraph above the court is not convinced by her argument that that legal provision was worded so vaguely that she could not foresee its applicability to her case indeed it is neither possible nor reasonable to specify the behaviour that might be considered as amounting to desecration of a tomb in different circumstances the court therefore considers that the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression complied with the requirement of lawfulnessb legitimate aim the court also subscribes to the governments view that the measure applied to the applicant pursued a legitimate aim of protecting morals and the rights of othersc necessary in a democratic societyi general principles freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society see handyside v the united kingdom december series a no and for a more recent reference bédat v switzerland gc no march those who create perform distribute or exhibit works of art contribute to the exchange of ideas and opinions which is essential for a democratic society hence the obligation on the state not to encroach unduly on their freedom of expression artists and those who promote their work are certainly not immune from the possibility of limitations as provided for in paragraph of article whoever exercises his or her freedom of expression undertakes in accordance with the express terms of that paragraph duties and responsibilities their scope will depend on his or her situation and the means he or she uses see for example vereinigung bildender künstler v austria no january the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered in the exercise of their discretion this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see bédat cited above lastly the fairness of the proceedings the procedural guarantees afforded and the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see among many other authorities bestry v poland no november and medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june ii application of the above principles to the present case turning to the facts of the present case the court notes that the applicant carried out what she considered to be an artistic performance aimed at protesting against wasteful use of natural gas by the state while turning a blind eye to poor living standards of veterans see paragraph above more specifically she fried eggs on the eternal glory memorial had her actions filmed prepared a statement explaining her position and posted the video with that statement on the internet however the applicant was criminally prosecuted and convicted only on account of frying eggs over the eternal flame which the domestic courts considered to have amounted to desecration of the tomb of the unknown soldier an offence under the ukrainian criminal code the charge against her concerned neither the subsequent distribution by her of the respective video nor the contents of the rather sarcastic and provocative text accompanying that video see in particular paragraph above in other words the applicant was not convicted for expressing the views that she did or even for expressing them in strong language her conviction was a narrow one in respect of particular conduct in a particular place compare maguire v the united kingdom dec no march moreover it was based on a general prohibition of contempt for the tomb of the unknown soldier forming part of ordinary criminal law as regards the fairness of the proceedings and the procedural guarantees afforded the court notes that there is nothing in the case file which would suggest that the domestic courts erred in their assessment of the relevant facts or incorrectly applied domestic law moreover while the domestic courts paid little attention to the applicants stated motives given their irrelevance for the legal classification of her actions the court notes that they did take into account the applicants individual circumstances in deciding on her sentence as regards the applicants reference to domestic cases concerning factually different incidents of desecration see paragraph above the court does not see how her conviction was in contradiction with that caselaw the court can not agree with the applicants submission that her conduct at the memorial could not be reasonably interpreted as contemptuous towards those in whose honour that memorial had been erected according to her logic the only thing that mattered about the eternal flame was the natural gas required to keep it burning however eternal flames are a longstanding tradition in many cultures and religions most often aimed at commemorating a person or event of national significance or serving as a symbol of an enduring nature the one on which the applicant fried eggs is part of a monument commemorating soldiers who gave their lives defending their and the applicants country during the second world war there were many suitable opportunities for the applicant to express her views or participate in genuine protests in respect of the states policy on the use of natural gas or responding to the needs of war veterans without breaking the criminal law and without insulting the memory of soldiers who perished and the feelings of veterans whose rights she had ostensibly meant to defend in assessing the nature and severity of the penalty the court notes its conclusion in the case concerning imprisonment for pouring paint over statues of atatürk that peaceful and nonviolent forms of expression in principle should not be made subject to the threat of a custodial sentence see murat vural v turkey no october the court observes however that in contrast to that case where the applicant was imprisoned for over thirteen years the applicant in the present case was given a suspended sentence and did not serve a single day of it see paragraph above having regard to all the circumstances of the case the court considers that the restriction complained of is reconcilable with the applicants freedom of expression the court therefore concludes that there has been no violation of article of the convention iii application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court finds that there has been a violation of the convention or the protocols thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party a damage the applicant claimed euros eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage the government contested that claim as unsubstantiated and exorbitant having regard to all the circumstances of the present case and the nature of the violations found the court considers it appropriate to award the applicant eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage b costs and expenses the applicant did not submit any claims under this heading apart from her request for legal aid the court therefore makes no award c default interest the court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the european central bank to which should be added three percentage points for these reasons the court declares unanimously the application admissible holds unanimously that there has been no violation of article of the convention in respect of the applicants arrest holds unanimously that there has been a violation of article of the convention in respect of the applicants detention from may to june holds unanimously that there has been a violation of article of the convention holds unanimously that there has been a violation of article of the convention holds by four votes to three that there has been no violation of article of the convention holds unanimouslya that the respondent state is to pay the applicant within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with article of the convention eur four thousand euros plus any tax that may be chargeable in respect of nonpecuniary damage to be converted in the currency of the respondent state at the rate applicable at the date of settlementb that from the expiry of the abovementioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage points dismisses unanimously the remainder of the applicants claim for just satisfaction done in english and notified in writing on february pursuant to rule and of the rules of court marialena tsirli vincent a de gaetano registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the joint partly dissenting opinion of judges yudkivska motoc and paczolay is annexed to this judgment vdgmtjoint partly dissenting opinion of judges yudkivska motoc and paczolay we fully share the reasoning and conclusions in the judgment on all points related to article of the convention we respectfully dissent however from the majoritys finding that article of the convention was not violated in the present case undoubtedly the applicants performance was extremely provocative given the sensitive nature of war memorials however it is a firm stance of this court expressed more than forty years ago in handyside v the united kingdom december series a no that freedom of expression is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb the state or any sector of the population although we acknowledge that decisions concerning attacks on a longstanding tradition in many cultures and religions aimed at commemorating a person or event of national significance paragraph are hard for all courts the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify the restriction imposed on the applicant were not in our view relevant and sufficient in particular we can not agree that the national judicial authorities applied the principles embodied in article and that they based their decisions on a satisfactory assessment of the relevant facts first of all we find that the analysis by the domestic courts was deficient for its failure to address the purpose of the applicants performance and its satirical nature the majority believe that since the applicant was convicted only on account of frying eggs over the eternal flame and not for the subsequent distribution of the respective video and accompanying text it can not be said that she was convicted for expressing her views see paragraph of the judgment we can not share this view she was convicted precisely for the performance as a whole two police officers who commented to her and her associates that their behaviour was inappropriate did not pursue the matter until after the subsequent posting of the video online and the relevant complaints the applicant belonged to an artistic group called the st luke brotherhood which was known for its provocative public performances paragraph their performance as she explained was aimed at drawing public attention to the incompatibility of the official pathos when it came to remembrance of the second world war with the miserable situation of surviving war veterans together with other participants she sought to highlight what they perceived as the superfluous nature of an eternal flame which whilst honouring the sacrifices of those who fell in the service of their country did little to support war veterans who desperately needed the states limited resources satura quidem tota nostra est is the famous saying of quilitian describing the composite nature of this literary genre satire extended rapidly to all form of artistic expression mainly in the social and political arena as stanisław jerzy lec wittily mentioned in his unkempt thoughts there are times when satire has to restore what pathos has destroyed this satirical performance necessarily included filming the process of frying eggs to be later put on the internet with the relevant commentary by filming and subsequently disseminating the video supplemented by the song and text the applicant and other participants chose to express their criticism through a rude and irreverent satire this courts approach to freedom of artistic protests is clearly established in its caselaw in vereinigung bildender künstler v austria no january the court stated thatsatire is a form of artistic expression and social commentary and by its inherent features of exaggeration and distortion of reality naturally aims to provoke and agitate accordingly any interference with an artists right or anyone elses right to such expression should be examined with particular caresee also eon v france no march and alves da silva v portugal no october such careful examination has not been afforded to the applicant whose claim before the domestic courts that the criminal proceedings against her were contrary to article was not adequately considered the majority dismissed the applicants protest stating in a surprisingly edificatory manner that there were many suitable opportunities for the applicant to express her views on the use of natural gas or responding to the needs of war veterans at paragraph thus ignoring its intended message and purpose the applicants satire had done exactly what this art frequently does it transferred the viewers attention from an object to its social context an artistic gesture might demonstrate the conditionality of established value boundaries but it does not reject them in the context of freedom of speech the us supreme court noted in the famous case of texas v johnson when holding that the desecration of the american flag was protected speech under the first amendment that symbolism is a primitive but effective way of communicating ideas in a fastmoving world it is not surprising that those who wish to highlight a particular cause or voice an opinion would have recourse to those symbolic acts and demonstrations which are likely to gather a greater degree of attention and trigger a wider debate than might have been achievable with more conventional and established forms of protest the relationship between art and the conveyance of opinions is a complicated one and whilst art should not be reduced to an opinion art quite often relates to the expression of an opinion in the present case the soviet song with a repeated refrain the battle is going on again and again as a soundtrack to the video also underlines the satirical nature of the protest and is selfexplanatory the protesters were criticising in their view the hypocritical behaviour of authorities who do not want to accept that the battle is already over and that it is time to propose real and not illusory care of those who handed the victory the applicants actions and those of her associates undoubtedly generated significant controversy and offence among many of those who became aware of it due perhaps to its perceived bad taste but their aim was the opposite in the words of george orwell the aim of the joke is not to degrade the human being but to remind him that he is already degraded the matter received extensive coverage in the media and online yet it must be emphasised that it is not the applicants opinions which have shocked and angered others but rather the manner in which she chose to communicate them to our regret neither domestic courts nor this court commented on the satirical nature of the performance moreover the domestic courts paid little attention to the applicants stated motives given their irrelevance for the legal classification of her actions although a little scope under article for restrictions on freedom of expression in the area of political speech or debate required them to give consideration to the structure of the performance as a whole and to conduct a sufficiently careful balancing exercise on the basis of the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw in murat vural v turkey cited in the judgment the court statedin deciding whether a certain act or conduct falls within the ambit of article of the convention an assessment must be made of the nature of the act or conduct in question in particular of its expressive character seen from an objective point of view as well as of the purpose or the intention of the person performing the act or carrying out the conduct in question this approach must surely be relevant not simply in determining the applicability of article but also in assessing whether there has been a violation of that provision finally this court has already mentioned that criminal penalties for conduct such as that of the applicant in the present case are likely to have a chilling effect on satirical forms of expression relating to topical issues such forms of expression can themselves play a very important role in open discussion of matters of public concern an indispensable feature of a democratic society see eon v france cited above as the court stated in murat vural peaceful and nonviolent forms of expression should not be made subject to the threat of imposition of a custodial sentence in that case even the infliction of criminal damage specifically the pouring of paint onto a statue were not viewed as being of a gravity justifying a custodial sentence in dmitriyevskiy v russia no october the court considered that the conviction of a journalist for incitement to hatred or enmity and his twoyear suspended sentence and four months probation had violated article as both the applicants conviction and the severe sanction imposed were capable of producing a chilling effect on the exercise of journalistic freedom of expression we find some inconsistency in the courts concern over the severe sanction of a suspended sentence in dmitriyevskiy and the position of the majority as to the same sanction in the present case where the applicant committed no criminal damage nor any breach of the peace in sum given the lack of adequate assessment by the national authorities of the applicants performance from the standpoint of article of the convention and the complete disregard of its satirical nature in addition to the disproportionate sentence we believe that article was violated in the present case as a general remark the present judgment inevitably gives rise to the question of how far a contracting state may criminalise insults to memory and designate certain spaces and structures as offlimits for individuals to exercise their right to protest and express their opinions in a manner consistent with article there is a real risk of eroding the right of individuals to voice their opinions and protest through peaceful albeit controversial means us citing west virginia state board of education v barnette us in johnson the petitioner had been convicted for desecration of a venerated object under texas state law tex penal code ann a under the law desecrate means to deface damage or otherwise physically mistreat in a way that the actor knows will seriously offend one or more persons likely to observe or discover his action for a discussion on this topic

23,in and lives in bulkowo he was represented by ms a bzdyń a lawyer practising in warsaw the government were represented by their agent ms j chrzanowska and subsequently by mr j sobczak of the ministry of foreign affairs the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows newsletter since the applicant has been the sole editor of a free monthly newsletter the voice of the municipality of bulkowo gazeta głos z gminy bulkowo which he has distributed in shops and other public places in ten editions of the newsletter were published with copies distributed for each edition the newsletter which consisted of a single doublesided piece of newsprint reported on local issues and scrutinised the activities of gg the mayor of the municipality wójt gminy of bulkowo in edition no published on september the applicant suggested that mayor gg had chosen the village of blichów for the harvest festival dożynki because he had hoped to generate support for his candidature in the upcoming elections furthermore the edition reported on a construction project for a wind farm in the municipality the article discussed the controversy arising from the negative implications of wind turbines for the health of local inhabitants and the adverse effect on land prices although the applicant did mention that the windturbine project had been commenced under the previous mayor he sought to emphasise that its implementation was to be attributed solely to mayor gg and to the local councillors currently in office the applicant also wrote about a charity in which ggs wife was treasurer the disparity for which gg was responsible between the amount of allowances given to local councillors and those given to mayors to the detriment of the latter and a decision reached by gg to take out a loan for polish zlotys pln over euros eur in edition no published on october the applicant indicated that the municipal debt had risen to pln which would result in an increase in taxes and charges that gg possessed more than hectares of farming land and that during his term of office as mayor gg had made some extra money on the side fuchy election campaign on august the campaign for local government elections wybory samorządowe formally started on september the płock electoral commissioner komisarz wyborczy set up local electoral commissions the applicant became a member of the electoral commission for the municipality gminna komisja wyborcza of bulkowo on october the electoral commission registered ss as a candidate for mayor of the municipality on the same date the electoral commission registered gg as a candidate for mayor of the municipality proceedings against the applicant on october gg represented by a lawyer lodged a claim against the applicant under article of the election code on october at am the applicant was informed by a clerk of the płock regional court sąd okręgowy of the claim and that a hearing was scheduled for the following day at am the claim with various attachments was sent to the applicants email address at pm the applicant claims that he opened the email some hours later by which time it was too late to appoint a lawyer in the claim gg requested that the applicant and the contact national trade union ogólnopolski związek zawodowy kontakt the publisher of the newsletter hereinafter the trade union be prohibited from disseminating untrue information about him gg requested that the newsletters be confiscated and that the applicant and the trade union be ordered to publish a notice in a regional weekly magazine explaining that the statements in issue were untrue and offering an apology for publishing them he also wanted a handwritten apology spisane własnoręcznie i podpisane oświadczenie and requested that the applicant and the trade union should pay pln approximately eur to a charity and cover the costs of the proceedings gg provided evidence to show that all the statements made by the applicant about him had been untrue the harvest festival in blichów had been a tradition for many years and had been held in the same locality regardless of local elections the suggestion that construction of the wind farm had been the sole responsibility of gg had been untrue as the investment had been approved prior to his term of office by the former mayor it was not true that gg as mayor had been involved in or was responsible for fixing the remuneration of local councillors and mayors domestic law clearly assigned responsibility in that regard to the local council the applicant was incorrect in quoting the amount of debt incurred on behalf of the municipality the correct amount was approximately pln not pln he was also incorrect in stating that an increase in taxes was planned when nothing of the sort had been considered the debts were to be paid off from the municipalitys own income derived from improvements in the collection of taxes not from an increase in taxes the claim that gg had hectares of land was not true as in reality he owned hectares furthermore contrary to the applicants statements gg had not been involved in any additional paid activity finally the charity that had been operating since and in which ggs wife had held various functions had no links with the campaign gg complained about the sensationalist nature of the newsletters and about how they had been tarnishing his good name something that was of particular importance during the election campaign during the hearing the applicant argued that the newsletters could not be considered as campaign material and that gg should not be allowed to use the procedure under article of the election code he stated that he had been critical of gg in earlier editions of his newsletter but that the court considered that the previous editions had not been relevant according to the official minutes of the hearing the applicant stated that the newsletters had been based on available documents together with his own conclusions on october the płock regional court gave a decision in which it allowed the claim on almost all the points the court ordered thata as requested by gg the applicant and the trade union refrain from disseminating the informationb editions and of the newsletter be seizedc the applicant and the trade union publish a notice in the regional magazine tygodnik płocki explaining that the impugned statements were untrue with an apologyd the applicant write a handwritten note to apologise for the untrue statementse the applicant and the trade union jointly pay pln approximately eur to a charity andf the applicant and the trade union jointly pay pln approximately eur in costs the regional court did not examine the part of the claim which related to the charity in which ggs wife had been treasurer ruling that the charity itself should have lodged a complaint the court considered that both the applicant and gg had participated in the election campaign the two editions of the newsletter had been almost entirely dedicated to issues pertaining to the election and to mayor gg as a person whose activities had been analysed in detail and criticised therefore the two editions of the newsletter had to be considered as campaign material and the case had to be examined under the procedure provided for by the election code the court emphasised that this summary procedure was intended to ensure fairness in the elections and to limit any adverse consequences of the dissemination of false information during that period the press had a duty to disseminate information in a responsible manner and based on facts otherwise the author and the publisher could be held liable as provided for by law the court considered that the applicants newsletters were examples of a negative campaign against gg consisting of gossip insinuations and allegations of a sensationalist and speculative nature that played on the emotions of readers for instance the applicant had intimidated readers with the allegedly negative impact of the wind farm on human health and had suggested that gg had devised an uncertain future for local inhabitants in connection with the charitys finances the applicant had used expressions such as the case reeks a new scandal was unfolding and the prosecutors should get involved in connection with the false information about the increase in taxes the applicant stated that gg would reach into peoples pockets according to the court such statements were aimed at manipulating the emotions of readers and the information provided had lacked details or references to its sources such statements violated the principles of good journalism and breached the personal rights of the claimant they unjustly placed him in a bad light and tarnished his good name the court further noted that gg had produced conclusive evidence that the applicants statements of fact had been untrue he had quoted inaccurate figures concerning the municipal debt the size of ggs landholding and the percentage of the planned increase in taxes the point made about the mayor being solely responsible for commissioning the wind farm and for setting the amount of the allowances of local councillors and mayors and the assertion that contrary to the law he had been involved in additional paid activities had all been untrue the court concluded as follows taking into account the number and gravity of the allegations the applicant and the trade union should cease disseminating such information apologise publicly and privately to gg and receive a financial punishment for the unjustified breach of the personal rights of the claimant in respect of his good name honesty competency responsibility for the financial standing of the municipality and integrity on october the applicant represented by a lawyer lodged an appeal against the decision the applicant argued that the newsletters could not be considered campaign material and that the claimant could not receive protection under article of the election code the applicant submitted that the september edition of the newsletter had been published prior to the date on which gg had officially become a candidate in the election moreover the newsletters could not be campaign material as they had not supported any candidate running for election on october the płock regional court allowed an application by gg to supplement the decision of october by adding a requirement that the correction of the false statements and the apology be published by october on october the łódź court of appeal dismissed the appeal in the first sentence of its written reasons the court stated as follows it should above all be emphasised that in his appeal the applicant does not question the assessment by the firstinstance court that the statements made in the publications in question were untrue the court examined the arguments raised in the appeal and dismissed them taking the view that article of the election code covered all forms of speech linked to election campaigns for speech to be covered by this provision it did not have to originate from the campaign committee of a candidate it included all statements made during the campaign and in connection with the election the court emphasised that in election campaigning the use of all available media was a common and legal practice provided that the information was true and that the value judgments were based on sufficient facts the newsletters in question although apparently not supporting any particular candidate had openly agitated against the incumbent mayor gg they were representative of a negative campaign aimed at discouraging the electorate from voting for a candidate the election campaign began in august so the dates on which both newsletters had been published fell within the period of campaigning the date on which gg had formally been declared a candidate for the post of mayor of the municipality was irrelevant lastly the court observed that the applicants engagement in the campaign had been in clear breach of the law since members of electoral commissions of which he was one were banned from active participation in the campaign on october the płock electoral commissioner warned the applicant that if he continued campaigning his membership of the electoral commission for the municipality of bulkowo would be revoked the local government elections took place on november gg was reelected as mayor of the municipality of bulkowo in the płock regional court agreed to the applicant paying the remaining pln of the sum awarded in favour of the charity in monthly instalments relevant legal framework and practicerelevant constitutional provisions article of the constitution provides as

complained under articles and of the convention that his right to freedom of expression as provided for in article had been violated in the summary proceedings under the election code the court considers that the applicants complaints should be examined solely from the standpoint of article bearing in mind that since the court is master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of the case it is not bound by the characterisation given by an applicant or a government see radomilja and others v croatia gc nos and march article reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the court notes that this complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merits the parties submissions the applicant emphasised the privileged role that the press occupied in a democratic society particularly in the context of free elections the applicant was a journalist and enjoyed protection as a public watchdog gg on the other hand was a politician who should have displayed a greater degree of tolerance towards criticism the applicant considered that the interference by the authorities had not had a legitimate aim he submitted that the publications in question had not affected ggs reputation and had not influenced the outcome of the elections moreover ultimately the applicant had not been removed as a member of the electoral commission which would have been the case had his actions constituted election campaigning in the newsletters the applicant had not commented on the private life of gg he had concentrated on matters important for the municipality the articles had dealt with financial matters and other crucial issues such as the construction of the wind farm they had been aimed at raising awareness among local inhabitants of the actions of the local government moreover the applicant had scrutinised the measures undertaken by gg over his entire fouryear term of office not solely prior to the election it was not clear why gg had waited until the period of the election campaign to raise complaints about the applicants conduct the applicant considered that the only explanation was that gg had intended to take advantage of the special procedure provided for by article of the election code according to the applicant this procedure offered protection to politicians against any insult or defamation and should be regarded as incompatible with article of the convention the applicant emphasised that he had obtained most of the information directly from the municipal office and from other publicly available documents the applicant claimed that during the hearing at first instance he had been deprived of the opportunity to adduce evidence proving the veracity of his statements moreover owing to time constraints he had been unable to appoint a lawyer or to apply for legal assistance finally the applicant emphasised that the penalty imposed on him had been unduly harsh and not proportionate to the offence the government considered that the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression had been prescribed by law namely article of the election code it pursued a legitimate aim as it had been intended to protect the reputation and rights of others in addition the government emphasised the particular context of safeguarding the proper process of elections as it had been necessary to protect a candidate during an election campaign from the dissemination of untrue information the government emphasised that the domestic courts had carried out an analysis of two conflicting interests in conformity with the principles enshrined in article of the convention the interference had therefore been proportionate and necessary to protect the candidate during the election campaign the government accepted that there was little scope under article for restrictions on political speech and on debate on questions of public interest they acknowledged that the applicant had been involved in journalistic activity and that gg as a politician had been a public figure however journalists had duties and responsibilities and had to comply with journalistic ethics the case in hand showed that the applicant had failed in those duties as the newsletters had contained statements of facts that had been untrue in the domestic proceedings the applicant had not presented any evidence proving the veracity of the statements in question nor had he contested the firstinstance courts assessment that they were untrue the applicant had not demonstrated that he had collected the material for the articles with due diligence consequently it could not be considered that he had acted in good faith the government emphasised that in the context of the forthcoming elections the dissemination by the applicant of untrue information about a candidate had necessitated a firm and quick response by the authorities that reaction had been justified and the sanction imposed had not been disproportionate in that connection the government submitted that the financial penalty that the courts had imposed namely pln payable to a charity was modest considering that it could legally have been as high as pln the courts assessment it is common ground between the parties that the decisions given by the courts in the case against the applicant and the sanctions imposed constituted interference by a public authority with the applicants right to freedom of expression the interference was undoubtedly prescribed by law namely article of the election code see paragraphs and above the court further accepts that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others in this case gg as a candidate in local elections within the meaning of article of the convention it also served to protect the integrity of the electoral process and thus the rights of the voters it remains to be established whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society in this regard the following general principles emerge from the courts caselaw see for instance pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no and in limine echr xi with further referencesa the test of necessity in a democratic society requires the court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by independent courts the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article of the conventionb the courts task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the competent domestic courts but rather to review under article the decisions they have taken in accordance with their margin of appreciation this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully or in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole including the content of the comments held against the applicants and the context in which they made themc in particular the court must determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify the interference were relevant and sufficient and whether the measure taken was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities basing themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article d the court has held that the requirement to prove to a reasonable standard that a factual statement was substantially true does not contravene article of the convention see rumyana ivanova v bulgaria no and february makarenko v russia no december and rukaj v greece dec no january and has held that a lack of effort to make out that defence against applicants see mahmudov and agazade v azerbaijan no december however it has also held that if an applicant is clearly involved in a public debate on an important issue he should not be required to fulfil a more demanding standard than that of due diligence in such circumstances the obligation to prove the factual statements may deprive the applicant of the protection afforded by article see kurski v poland no july braun v poland no november and makraduli v the former yugoslav republic of macedonia nos and july in the present case the applicant was sanctioned in summary proceedings under the election code for statements made in two editions of his newsletter published during the local election campaign in the domestic courts found against him and in particular ordered him to pay a sum to a charity and to apologise to gg who was a politician and a candidate for the post of mayor of the municipality of bulkowo see paragraph above the court reiterates that free elections and freedom of expression particularly freedom of political debate together form the bedrock of any democratic system see mathieu mohin and clerfayt v belgium march series a no the two rights are interrelated and operate to reinforce each other for this reason it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds are permitted to circulate freely see bowman v the united kingdom february reports i this principle applies equally to national and local elections see kwiecień v poland no january at the same time the court recognises the importance of protecting the integrity of the electoral process from false information that affect voting results and the need to put in place the procedures to effectively protect the reputation of candidates mutatis mutandis brzeziński v poland no july it should further be observed that as a politician holding public office and a candidate in elections gg had inevitably and knowingly laid himself open to public scrutiny see lingens v austria july series a no and oberschlick v austria no may series a no article of the convention does not however guarantee wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern and of political figures under the terms of paragraph of that article the exercise of this freedom carries with it duties and responsibilities which also apply to the press these duties and responsibilities are liable to assume significance when as in the present case there is a question of attacking the reputation of named individuals and undermining the rights of others by reason of the duties and responsibilities inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression the safeguard afforded by article to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism see mutatis mutandis bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii having examined the statements in question the court agrees with the domestic courts that they were to a large extent statements of fact the regional court considered that the claimant had proved having produced material evidence that each of the applicants statements was untrue see paragraph above it is clear from the minutes of the hearing at first instance that the applicant did not rely on any particular evidence in support of the veracity of his statements or request the court to admit new evidence see paragraph above he limited himself to stating that the information was in the public domain or came from official sources without naming them the applicant can not therefore claim that his statements of facts have been supported by the material he had gathered moreover in his appeal against the decision at first instance lodged by a lawyer of his choice the applicant did not contest the conclusion of the firstinstance court that his statements of fact had not been true see paragraph above consequently he did not submit any evidence at the appellate level relating to his sources of information or otherwise pointing to the veracity of his statements this fact was noted by the łódź court of appeal in the opening remarks of its judgment of october see paragraph above the applicant failed to give any plausible explanation for his failure to supplement the evidence at the appellate level furthermore in the domestic proceedings the applicant failed to indicate the sources of his information and why they had not been accurate likewise in the proceedings before the court the applicant failed to specify his sources and to demonstrate that he had acted with due diligence the applicant also failed to demonstrate that the research done by him before the publication of the untrue statements of fact was in good faith and complied with the ordinary journalistic obligation to verify a factual allegation see rumyana ivanova v bulgaria no february the domestic courts balanced two conflicting interests namely the interest of all participants in election campaigns in being able to use every mean possible to influence voters and the right of a candidate to be protected from untrue allegations the płock regional court emphasised the duties of the press to report in a diligent manner and on the basis of facts see paragraph above the appellate court noted that even value judgments had to be based on sufficient facts see paragraph above the court reiterates that where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the court would require strong reasons to substitute its own view for that of the domestic courts see von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr having regard to the foregoing the court is satisfied that the reasons adduced by the national courts for sanctioning the applicant were relevant and sufficient within the meaning of its caselaw in this connection the court observes that it is unable to subscribe to the applicants argument that the very use of summary proceedings provided for in article of the election code was in violation of article of the convention the court notes that the proceedings of this type are conducted within very short time frames and they are aimed at ensuring the proper conduct of the election campaign by preventing infringements of the candidates personal rights which are capable of affecting the outcome of the elections the court reiterates that the provision of such a summary remedy during periods of election campaigns be they at local or national level serves the legitimate goal of ensuring the fairness of the electoral process and as such should not be questioned from the convention standpoint see kwiecień cited above at the same time as desirable as the expeditious examination of electionrelated disputes may be it should not result in the undue curtailment of the procedural guarantees afforded to the parties to such proceedings in particular the defendants in this regard the court notes that the applicant was informed of the case on the morning of october and that the hearing had been scheduled for the following day see paragraph above although that clearly constituted short notice it would still have been possible for the applicant to instruct a lawyer on that day there is nothing to indicate that the applicant made such an attempt the proceedings concerned the two most recent editions of the newsletter which had been edited exclusively by the applicant the applicant did not adduce any evidence before the trial courts compare and contrast kwiecień cited above it is therefore not apparent that the case was of any particular complexity such that it would have been difficult for the applicant to present it effectively before the court the applicant instructed a lawyer after the hearing on october and was represented in the subsequent appellate proceedings the court is therefore not persuaded that the circumstances of the instant case amounted to a lack of procedural fairness and equality that could give rise to an issue under article of the convention compare and contrast steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no echr xi in this connection the court notes that the applicant was found liable for defamation in summary proceedings instituted by the aggrieved party the applicant and the trade union were jointly ordered to publish an apology and to pay the equivalent of eur to a charity the applicant has not submitted details of his personal financial situation and the court is unable to assess whether such an award against him was excessive and imposed a disproportionate burden on him moreover it is not clear what amount was actually paid by the applicant given the fact that he was found jointly liable with the trade union in the light of the preceding considerations and given the states margin of appreciation in applying the summary procedure under the election code the court is of the view that the interference complained of may be regarded as necessary in a democratic society and was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued within the meaning of paragraph of article of the convention there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimouslydeclares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on october pursuant to rule and of the rules of court signature_p_renata degener ksenija turković registrar president,,,
24,represented by ms t abazadze and then by ms n jomarjidze lawyers practising in tbilisi the government were represented by their agent mr b dzamashvili of the ministry of justice the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows the first and second applicants are journalists who at the material time worked as respectively the managing director of the third applicant and the editorinchief of a weekly newspaper published by the latter in the third applicants office in batumi started receiving reports from local people of arbitrary customs clearance practices being conducted by georgian border police officers at the checkpoint in sarpi on the state border between turkey and georgia the sarpi checkpoint the first and second applicants decided to respond to the calls by conducting a journalistic investigation on august the first and second applicants crossed the state border in the direction of turkey and headed back after passing passport control they without anything to declare entered the restricted customs control zone of the sarpi checkpoint where newly arrived passengers were filling in customs declarations and duties were being levied on imported goods the restricted zone was enclosed by a fence which had multiple warning signs on it saying customs control zone the second applicant started interviewing people who were in the process of declaring imported goods to customs officers while the first applicant took photographs of the scene they had already recorded interviews with all the travellers present when a customs officer warned them that they were hindering the smooth running of the customs operation and that since they did not have anything to declare they had to vacate the restricted customs control zone the applicants refused referring to the freedom to exercise their profession as journalists as they saw fit they refused to leave the restricted zone even after the chief customs officer repeatedly told them to vacate the premises as a result the two applicants were fined georgian laris gel approximately euros eur each for disobeying the customs officers lawful orders an administrative offence under article of the customs code of georgia the customs code they were then escorted out of the restricted zone neither their recording equipment nor recorded interviews were confiscated in the week following the incident of august at the sarpi checkpoint the batumelebi newspaper featured a comprehensive article about the customs procedures presenting all the findings of the first and second applicants journalistic investigation including the interviews recorded in the customs control zone on the above date on november the first and second applicants acting in their individual capacity filed a court action requesting annulment of the administrative sanction imposed on them on august they claimed that it had had no legal basis that their conduct in the customs control zone of the sarpi checkpoint had been in no way disruptive and that they had merely been exercising their profession as journalists they further argued that their journalistic freedom had been undermined as a result of being sanctioned for interviewing people in the customs control zone the interviews had according to them been a necessary step in the process of preparing their journalistic investigation see paragraph above by a judgment of february the tbilisi city court dismissed the first and second applicants action as illfounded after hearing the parties submissions and examining witness statements and other evidence available in the case file the court found that their conduct on august in the customs control zone of the sarpi checkpoint had disrupted the customs procedures more specifically it was established that the questions put by the second applicant to the people declaring imported goods had prompted the importers to start arguing with the customs officers over the accuracy of the amounts of customs duties being levied it had been because of that disturbance that the customs officers had ordered the two applicants to vacate the restricted zone the city court emphasised that the order had been lawful since the applicants had entered the zone without prior authorisation in flagrant breach of article of the customs code and articles and of order no of the minister of finance of december since the applicants had not obeyed the repeated orders of the customs officers the imposition of the fine had been both lawful that is to say based on article of the same code and proportionate as regards the first and second applicants reference to their journalistic freedom the city court reiterated that they had been fined not for exercising their profession as journalists but for breaches of the relevant customs rules namely unauthorised entry into the customs control zone and failure to comply with the customs officers lawful orders the court stated that journalists could not be immune from the rules that applied to the general public if the applicants had wished in their capacity as journalists to monitor the unfolding of the customs procedures in the restricted zone of the sarpi checkpoint all they had had to do was obtain prior authorisation to access the premises and act appropriately once inside without stirring up trouble it had also been open to the applicants to gather the desired information about the customs procedures by alternative and less intrusive means for instance by interviewing people already at the exit of the checkpoint after they had declared the imported goods and paid the relevant duties on march the first and second applicants filed an appeal against the judgment of february they contested the lower courts establishment of the facts claiming that they had not caused any real disturbance in the customs control zone of the sarpi checkpoint and that all they had been doing had been interviewing and taking pictures of the importers of goods and the customs officers the two applicants also called into question the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the customs code by the lower court arguing that the provisions were not sufficiently foreseeable as regards their effects lastly they reiterated their complaint about the fine representing a disproportionate interference with journalistic freedom by a decision of june the tbilisi court of appeal after reexamining the case on both issues of fact and law fully upheld the lower courts judgment of february the appellate court clarified that since the first and second applicants had entered the sarpi checkpoint from the turkish side as ordinary passengers they had been obliged to abide by the customs rules applicable to all in other words they had had no right to enter the restricted customs control zone without anything to declare and without permission from the customs office after being given lawful orders to vacate the unlawfully accessed premises the first and second applicants had had to obey them being journalists did not absolve them from the obligation to respect the law the appellate court emphasised that the relevant provisions of the customs code supplemented by articles and of order no were sufficiently clear and precise in their wording and that the two applicants could thus easily have foreseen the consequences of their wrongful conduct especially in view of the fact that they had been duly warned by the customs officers before being fined the appellate court further reiterated that it had been open to the two applicants to conduct the interviews with the newly arrived passengers not inside the customs control zone but already at the exit of the checkpoint alternatively if they had wished to record the customs clearance procedures they should have sought authorisation from the customs office in accordance with article of the customs code on december an appeal on points of law lodged by the first and second applicants calling into question the foreseeability of the legal provisions that had served as the basis for the sanction was rejected by the supreme court of georgia as inadmissible which brought the proceedings to an end relevant legal framework article of the customs code of georgia as in force at the material time provided as follows the circulation of goods transport vehicles and people in the customs control zone shall only be allowed with official authorisation and under the supervision of the customs office article of the same code read as follows resisting a customs officer failure to comply with the officers lawful order or request shall be sanctioned by a fine of gel according to articles and of order no of the minister of finance of december which was in force at the material time areas buildings and means of transportation including aircrafts ships and railway units that contain declarable goods obtained the status of restricted customs control zone by default the lawalleged violation of article of the convention all three applicants complained that the imposition of a fine for engaging in newsgathering activities had constituted a breach of article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the government argued that the application was inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remedies since the three applicants had never attempted to sue the customs authority under the general rules of tort law contained in the civil code they also briefly stated without providing any additional arguments that the application should be dismissed for lack of any significant disadvantage under article b of the convention in view of the applicants abovementioned failure to sue the customs office lastly the government submitted that the third applicant had not exhausted domestic remedies as it had never been a party to the proceedings at domestic level the applicants disagreed in so far as the third applicant is concerned the court observes that this legal entity was not a party to the domestic proceedings unlike the first two applicants it can be inferred from the parties submissions that this applicant did intend to complain to the court on behalf of its employees the first and second applicants however a legal entity is not allowed to claim under article of the convention to be a victim of acts or omissions which have affected the rights and freedoms of associated individuals who are themselves adult persons with full legal capacity to act and can thus lodge complaints with the court in their own name compare identoba and others v georgia no may with further references it follows that the third applicant can not validly claim on the facts of the present case to be either a direct or indirect victim within the meaning of article of the convention of an alleged breach of the first and second applicants rights under article this part of the application is thus incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the convention within the meaning of article a and must be rejected in accordance with article as regards the governments argument that it was open to the first and second applicants company to sue the customs authority under the general rules of tort law the court reiterates that where there is a choice of remedies the exhaustion requirement must be applied to reflect the practical realities of the applicants position so as to ensure the effective protection of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the convention an applicant who has used a remedy which is apparently effective and sufficient can not be required also to have tried others that were also available but probably no more likely to be successful see amongst many authorities adamski v poland dec no january given that the first and second applicants choice to seek annulment of their fine the administrative sanction that lay at the core of their complaints under article was a relevant and appropriate course of action they can not be reproached for not having had recourse to the other remedy referred to by the government compare lawyer partners as v slovakia nos and others echr and the governments objection in this regard should therefore be rejected as to the governments objection under article b of the convention the court observes that it is unsubstantiated thus besides a mere reference to the amount of fines against the applicants the government have not explained why they consider that the applicants have suffered no significant disadvantage compare for instance berladir and others v russia no july and giuran v romania no echr extracts furthermore no submissions have been made on two safeguard clauses contained in the relevant provision noting the nature of the issues raised in the present case which also arguably concerns an important matter of principle as well as the scope of the limitations the court does not find it appropriate to dismiss the present application with reference to article b of the convention the court notes that the first and second applicants complaints under article are neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in article of the convention this part of the application must therefore be declared admissible merits the parties submissionsa the applicants the first and second applicants stated that the interference with their journalistic freedom could not be said to have been prescribed by law as the wording of the relevant domestic provisions namely articles and of the customs code did not meet the foreseeability requirement in particular the two legal provisions did not allow with a sufficient level of precision for a conclusion that their entry and stay in the customs control zone of the border checkpoint had been unlawful they also argued that there had been no discernible legitimate aim for the interference with their newsgathering activities the two applicants also submitted that their actions had never caused any disturbance in the zone that they had been unobtrusively interviewing the passengers and that the customs officers had therefore had no valid reason to sanction them also the only way of obtaining reliable information about the customs clearance practices had been to observe the process in the customs zone in person the applicants asserted that they had not been obliged by law to obtain prior authorisation to engage in journalistic activities recording and interviewing people in the statecontrolled zone as regards the fine imposed on them the applicants stated that the amount had been high enough to have a chilling effect on investigative journalismb the government the government firstly submitted that there had been no interference given that the applicants had been able to interview the people of their choice in the customs control zone of the sarpi checkpoint and publish a comprehensive newspaper article based on those interviews furthermore they had been fined not for their journalistic activities but for their failure to comply with the customs officers lawful orders even assuming that there had been such an interference the government submitted that it had been prescribed by law and proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued prevention of disorder and protection of the rights of others present in the customs control zone as regards the lawfulness aspect they referred to articles and of the customs code and articles and of order no see paragraphs above stating that first and second applicants conduct in the clearly identifiable restricted customs zone had been in breach of customs legislation warranting an administrative sanction the government further submitted that the domestic courts had given wellreasoned decisions being journalists could not give the applicants immunity from the law and it had been open to the first and second applicant to conduct the relevant newsgathering activities in a less intrusive manner by either interviewing the people at the exit of the customs control zone or if the applicants had wished to observe the customs clearance procedures by requesting prior authorisation from the customs office to enter the otherwise restricted statecontrolled zone the third partys submissions the media legal defence initiative submitted that border areas could be a valuable source of newsworthy stories that could inform the public and contribute to debates of general interest it listed examples of journalists travelling to such areas to report on stories involving corruption the cable undercover investigation nigerias customs of corruption bribery and forgery december trafficking san antonio express news border journalists in reynosa mexico navigate dangers to report on continued gunbattles in the streets may military conflicts bbc kashmir conflict tension on the india pakistan border october and immigration borderzine experienced border journalists share tips for tough immigration stories october the third party then continued by submitting extensive legal arguments as to why newsgathering by journalists ought to be treated as an activity meriting a high level of protection under article of the convention those arguments were mostly based on an overview of the courts caselaw relating to freedom of expression but also by reference to international legal materials on the matter the courts assessmenta whether there was an interference the court considers that even if the administrative sanction was not necessarily aimed at the applicants as journalists it still interfered with their right to freedom of expression because they were held responsible for acts that formed part of an investigation for an article to be published compare pentikäinen v finland gc no echr salihu and others v sweden dec no may and erdtmann v germany dec no january b whether the interference was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim the court reiterates its settled caselaw according to which the expression prescribed by law not only requires that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law but also refers to the quality of the law in question which should be accessible to the person concerned and foreseeable as to its effects however it is primarily for the national authorities notably the courts to interpret and apply domestic law see pentikäinen cited above and in the present case the applicants argument that the domestic provisions were not foreseeable as to their effects was duly examined by the domestic courts which all ruled that articles and of the customs code and articles and of order no clearly proscribed the type of acts in question see paragraphs and above that being so the applicants argument contesting the interpretation of the relevant domestic provisions and their application to the circumstances of the case is beyond the courts competence given that the domestic decisions do not contain any arbitrary reasoning compare for instance satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june pentikäinen cited above and haldimann and others v switzerland no echr the court thus concludes that the impugned interference was prescribed by law within the meaning of the second paragraph of article of the convention furthermore the court accepts that the interference complained of pursued the legitimate aim of preventing disorder in the statecontrolled customs zonec whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society the court considers that in order to answer this question it needs to assess the circumstances of the case against the following two considerations inherent in its caselaw under article of the convention the value of the newsgathering activities and the concept of responsible journalismi relevant general principles the court reiterates that the gathering of information is an essential preparatory step in journalism and a protected part of press freedom a restriction on a journalists research and investigative activities always calls for the closest scrutiny by the court on account of the great danger inherent in attempts to restrict preparatory journalistic steps see dammann v switzerland no april indeed obstacles created in order to hinder access to information which is of public interest may discourage those working in the media or related fields from pursuing such matters as a result they may no longer be able to play their vital role as public watchdogs and their ability to provide accurate and reliable information may be adversely affected see shapovalov v ukraine no july the concept of responsible journalism as a professional activity which enjoys the protection of article of the convention is not confined to the contents of information which is collected andor disseminated by journalistic means this concept also encompasses amongst other things the lawfulness of the conduct of a journalist including his or her public interaction with the authorities when exercising journalistic functions the fact that a journalist has breached the law in that connection is a most relevant albeit not decisive consideration when determining whether he or she has acted responsibly the court reiterates in this connection that paragraph of article does not guarantee wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to media coverage of matters of serious public concern in particular and notwithstanding the vital role played by the media in a democratic society journalists can not in principle be released from their duty to obey the ordinary criminal law on the basis that as journalists article affords them a castiron defence in other words a journalist can not claim exclusive immunity from criminal liability for the sole reason that unlike other individuals exercising the right to freedom of expression the offence in question was committed during the performance of his or her journalistic functions see pentikäinen cited above and with further references thereinii application of these principles to the circumstances of the case the court observes at the outset that the domestic courts themselves conducted a fullyfledged balancing exercise in relation to the applicants right to freedom of expression duly acknowledging their status as journalists and giving solid reasons for their decisions see paragraphs and above and contrast szurovecz v hungary no and october the adequacy of the domestic judicial review significantly increases the respondent states margin of appreciation in this case as the court would require strong reasons to substitute its own view for that of the domestic courts compare amongst many others palomo sánchez and others v spain gc nos and others echr rungainis v latvia no june and mgn limited v the united kingdom no and january as regards the existence of such strong reasons the court to start with has little doubt that the newsgathering activities conducted by the first and second applicant at the sarpi checkpoint were capable of meaningfully contributing to public debate on a matter of public interest compare haldimann and others cited above namely the allegedly arbitrary customs clearance practices however it is less persuaded on the facts of the case that the applicants used their best endeavours to interact with the relevant public authority in good faith and in a responsible manner ibid more specifically if the applicants wished to hear about the practical experience of travellers and merchants who had recently had dealings with the local customs office then as indicated by the domestic courts instead of trespassing onto the restricted statecontrolled zone they could have waited for and interviewed the passengers at the exit of the zone furthermore the applicants did not suggest and prove in the proceedings before the domestic courts that had authorisation to access the statecontrolled zone been requested it would have been refused alternatively if they deemed it important to witness incognito without soliciting prior authorisation the customs clearance procedures they still remained under a legal obligation to vacate the restricted zone as soon as they received lawful orders to do so from the officers in charge of the zone it is also important in this connection that at no point in the domestic proceedings did the applicants show that only firsthand and direct knowledge of the customs procedures based on their personal experience and presence in the restricted zone could have the value and reliability to the extent necessary for their journalistic activities contrast selmani and others v the former yugoslav republic of macedonia no february and szurovecz cited above assuming that the first and second applicants had no other option but to make in their capacity as journalists a choice between the general duty to abide by ordinary administrative law from which they were obviously not absolved and their professional duties and that they made this choice to the detriment of the duties of a lawabiding citizen then the very least that was expected of them under the concept of responsible journalism was to be aware of and accept the legal consequences of the unlawful conduct including the risk of being subject to legal sanctions compare pentikäinen cited above the court reiterates that journalists can not in principle be released from their duty to obey the ordinary law solely on the basis that article affords them protection see the general principles cited in fine of paragraph above and also stoll v switzerland gc no echr v two other important factors tip the balance in favour of finding that the interference with the first and second applicants rights under article of the convention was necessary in a democratic society firstly it is significant that the domestic authorities did not object to the applicants making full use of the interviews recorded during their time

25,the applicant was born in and lives in helsinki the applicant is a journalist with a nationwide evening newspaper ilta sanomat on july ilta sanomat published an article written by the applicant concerning the investigation into a homicide which had been committed a few days earlier the article referred to ku a wellknown finnish businessman the front page of the edition carried a headline cruel killing in vantaa the executed man had connections with ku a photograph of ku also appeared on the front page the article itself was entitled the victim of the vantaa homicide had connections with ku under a smaller heading the suspect in the cruel execution killing is a former member of the motorcycle gang the article read po who was brutally killed in vantaa may have had connections with the businessman ku in po was captured trying to smuggle bags containing money from estonia into finland the police suspect that those bags with contents belonged to kuthe incident is currently pending before the prosecutor for the consideration of charges po is suspected of an aggravated receiving offence and ku of aggravated debtors fraud in that connection other suspects besides po and ku have also been exposed regarding that case in practice po is being considered as a suspected receiver the leader of the investigation criminal inspector mi of the national bureau of investigation keskusrikospoliisi centralkriminalpolisen says that the ku connection is a part of the investigation into the vantaa homicide under the following subheading the suspect admitted to being at the scene the article went on the police have detained a year old man as a suspect in pos murder in the light of the current evidence the detained person has no connection with ku says the inspector the article continued with information concerning the detained person and the ongoing investigation into the homicide it quoted the investigators statement that it was possible that the suspect had been acting under commission which according to the applicant implied the possibility of a contract killing the article was illustrated by a photograph apparently taken in the vicinity of the crime scene next to the article there was a separate information column concerning kus previous conviction for economic crimes and his academic achievements under a heading who the column reproduced a photograph of ku taken at the public defence of his doctoral thesis on the same date the same information was published in the other evening newspaper iltalehti in the form of an interview given by ku on april the public prosecutor preferred charges against the applicant and hs the newspapers editorinchief at the time in his indictment the prosecutor maintained that by writing and allowing publication of the above article the applicant and hs had given false information about ku in a manner that had been conducive to causing him suffering and damage and to subjecting him to contempt and that they had also disparaged him in other ways the prosecutor did not allege that the information imparted in the article had been false as such but contended inter alia that the combination of large headings with question marks the text of the article the photographs of ku and his personal profile had aimed to insinuate to the readership that ku might have had a motive to commission the killing ku for his part requested that the applicant and hs be punished and claimed compensation for suffering and legal costs in the same proceedings he contended that the defendants had unlawfully connected him with murder in finlands largest evening newspaper the use of his photograph taken at the public defence of his doctoral thesis had added to his suffering as he was thus defamed as an academic which was to be his future career according to ku the worst part of the criminal act had been the combination of the heading and his photograph and the image thus created in the minds of those people who had not read the article itself the defendants had sought to profit by their act in addition to the permanent stigma ku maintained that the offence had brought shame and distress to his family the applicant and hs contested the charge and the civil claims their main arguments were the following the article did not contain any false information nor could it have disparaged ku or caused him suffering the latter point was highlighted by the fact that ku had himself given an interview concerning the same matter to another evening newspaper published on the same date the article concerned a criminal investigation of general interest and was based on information given by the authorities ku was a public figure and his connection with po had been an issue of general interest and significance in itself by pressing charges the prosecutor had unnecessarily interfered with the defendants freedom of expression protected by the constitution and article of the convention when heard in person at the district courts oral hearing hs submitted inter alia that ku had contacted him after the article had been published he had been very hurt and upset hs had then offered him the possibility of rectification according to the documents ku had turned down that offer on august the helsinki district court käräjäoikeus tingsrätten issued its judgment it convicted the applicant and hs of defamation pursuant to chapter article paragraph point of the penal code the applicant was sentenced to dayfines amounting to a total of euros eur she was also ordered to pay ku jointly and severally with hs eur for suffering and eur in legal costs in its reasons the court noted that it had to examine the conflicting interests of freedom of expression and the right to privacy referring to sections and of the constitution and article of the convention it also made reference to the supreme court precedent no kko where that court found that the freedom of expression did not justify violation of a persons honour or private life in assessing the article written by the applicant the court found as follows it is undisputed that in the summer of ku was a public figure it is also undisputed that the article did not contain factual errors thus each piece of information contained therein was accurate the district court has to assess whether the article included such insinuations that have been conducive to causing suffering or contempt or if it was disparaging in other aspects the article covered the pretrial investigation of a homicide which had taken place a few days earlier as well as another largescale case concerning economic crime already pending before the prosecutor the same person had been the victim of the homicide and one of the suspects in the economic offences ku had known the victim of the homicide and was also one of the suspects in the case concerning economic offences the defendants have pleaded inter alia that the newspaper had been obliged to report on crime the article had emphasised the connection between ku and the victim of the homicide in the district courts view no such circumstances have emerged in these proceedings which would have linked the fact that ku had known the victim of the homicide to his public activities nor has it been established that the fact that ku knew the victim had been of general interest or that this piece of news had had such significance to society that it had been important to publish it the district court concluded the most central topics of the article had been the connection with the victim of the homicide and ku suspicions of economic offences organised crime and a possible contract killing the use of the heading the victim of the vantaa homicide had connections with ku along with the background information on ku under a title who illustrated with his photograph had personified the whole article to ku although the heading of the article carried a question mark and the first paragraph in the text mentioned that the victim might italics added here have had connections with ku the text does not provide an immediate answer to that question nor does it state clearly that the victim and ku had known each other only from other circumstances the article had left the answers open as the text dealt with the connection between the victim of the homicide and ku and at the end a possible contract killing ku had also been connected with a contract killing connecting a person groundlessly with a contract killing violates his honour by combining information received and statements given by the head of the investigation and by mixing two different criminal investigations the article has given an ambiguous picture of the connection between those cases the headings and the information concentrating on kus personal profile had made ku the main common feature of the crimes the district court finds that in the article ku had been linked with a homicide in a manner that insinuated a connection between ku and the commission of the homicide and a contract killing such an insinuation violates kus honour and has caused him suffering the district court was composed of one professional judge and three lay judges one of the lay judges was in favour of an acquittal in his dissenting opinion he stressed the fact that all the information presented in the article had been accurate in his view the mere fact that a party to the case his family or friends were shocked about the news coverage or that the readers of a newspaper were not fully able to comprehend the text could not constitute defamation the applicant and hs appealed against the judgment to the helsinki court of appeal hovioikeus hovrätten relying mainly on their previous arguments they also contested the lower courts interpretation of the law on november the court of appeal upheld the district courts judgment in its reasoning the appellate court reiterated that giving false information or making false insinuations about another person in a manner conducive to causing damage or suffering to that person or subjecting that person to contempt constituted defamation as set out in chapter article paragraph point of the penal code it referred to the relevant government bill for the amendment of that provision he vp in stating that it was characteristic of that offence to concern false factual information or a false insinuation bearing a close resemblance to factual information in principle the veracity of an argument may be reviewed afterwards if an argument is accurate or if the insinuation concerns a fact the act may nevertheless be punishable as defamation under point of the provision if the information is given or insinuation made with a view to disparaging another person deliberately the court then found that it is undisputed that the information in the article published in ilta sanomat on july concerning two different criminal matters was accurate as such the common feature of those matters has been the fact that ku and the victim of the homicide had been suspects in one of the criminal cases mentioned in the article the headings of the article the text and the photographs of ku on the cover and on the article have however created a connection falsely implying that ku was somehow involved in the homicide the heading of the article and its tone were such that the fact that ku was not strictly speaking an accomplice to the homicide only became clear on reading through the article more closely it followed that chapter article paragraph point of the penal code was to be applied in this case as indicated by the district court the court of appeal went on to assess in detail whether the defendants conduct could be regarded as intentional the court found that the applicant was a professional journalist and that she must have considered it probable that her article contained a false insinuation and that this false insinuation was capable of causing suffering reaching thus an affirmative conclusion the court found no reason to deviate from the outcome of the lower courts judgment on november the supreme court korkein oikeus högsta domstolen refused leave to appeal ii relevant domestic law the finnish constitution suomen perustuslaki finlands grundlag act no provides in relevant parts section the right to privacy everyones private life

personskadeärenden in compensation awards for distress in defamation cases can go up to eur and in cases concerning dissemination of information violating personal privacy up to eur on the other hand the maximum award for for example attempted manslaughter murder or killing varies between eur and eur the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained about a violation of her right to freedom of expression as provided in article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissionsa the applicant the applicant stressed that the guidelines for journalists could not be used as a basis for criminal liability or liability for damages as they had only been drafted for the purpose of selfregulation within the profession the applicant maintained that the government and ku had never alleged at any stage of the proceedings that the information presented by the applicant in the article in question might have been incorrect the clear wording of the penal code showed that the judgment of the court of appeal had been incorrect in this respect the applicant had not written that ku had had a connection to the killer instead she had written that a connection had existed to the victim of the homicide which had been true the conclusion could not therefore be that ku had a connection to the homicide as the court of appeal had incorrectly stated the applicant pointed out that the court of appeal had not referred to the courts caselaw nor balanced the applicants right to freedom of expression against kus right to reputation no reasons had been given as to why there had been a compelling social need to limit the applicants freedom of expression nor had any reasons been given as to why such limitation had been considered proportionate visàvis the legitimate aim relied on the applicant claimed that the government seemed to expect that there needed to be a ground for publishing information while the courts caselaw showed the opposite namely that there needed to be a special ground for not publishing certain information the present article could not insult kus honour solely on the ground that the same information had been published in another evening newspaper in kus own words on the same dateb the government the government agreed that the applicants conviction and the obligation to pay damages and costs had amounted to an interference with her right to freedom of expression as to the requirement that measures be prescribed by law the government pointed out that the impugned measures had had a basis in finnish law namely in chapter section of the penal code moreover the guidelines for journalists journalistin ohjeet journalistreglerna also regulated the correctness of information the possibility of publishing a crime suspects name had gradually been clarified through the practice of the supreme court but the applicant had not sought legal advice on publishing kus name and photograph consequently in the governments view the relevant domestic law had been precise enough for the applicant to be able to foresee to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances of the present case the consequences which her action would entail moreover the legitimate aim had been to protect kus reputation the government maintained that the interference had also been necessary in a democratic society the title and the text of the article in question had indirectly connected ku with a homicide and his name and photograph had been published nationwide in that context thus a large number of persons had become aware of the article even though ku had offered an interview about the same matter to another evening newspaper published on the same date he had not consented to the publication of his name and photograph in the article in question both the district court and the court of appeal had found that the article had given an erroneous impression that ku was linked to the homicide in question even taking into account that he was a public figure there had been no justification for giving the impression that ku had been connected to the homicide as to the fines and the amount of compensation imposed the government argued that they had been significantly lower than in some other previous finnish article cases bearing in mind the margin of appreciation the government argued that the interference in the present case had been necessary in a democratic society the courts assessment whether there was an interference the court agrees that the applicants conviction and the award of damages and costs constituted an interference with her right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the convention whether it was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim the court notes that according to the government the impugned measures had a basis in finnish law namely in chapter section of the penal code moreover the interference complained of had a legitimate aim namely the protection of the reputation or rights of others the applicant did not dispute this the court notes that freedom of expression is subject to the exceptions set out in article of the convention the court accepts that the interference was based on chapter section of the penal code as in force at the relevant time it was thus prescribed by law see nikula v finland no echr ii selistö v finland no november karhuvaara and iltalehti v finland no echr x and eerikäinen and others v finland no february and it pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others within the meaning of article whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society according to the courts wellestablished caselaw freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article of the convention it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society this freedom is subject to the exceptions set out in article which must however be strictly construed the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly see for example lingens v austria july series a no and nilsen and johnsen v norway gc no echr viii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with a european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article see janowski v poland gc no echr i the courts task in exercising its supervision is not to take the place of national authorities but rather to review under article in the light of the case as a whole the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation see among many other authorities fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction the court must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case as a whole including the content of the remarks made by the applicant and the context in which she made them in particular it must determine whether the interference in issue was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient see sunday times v the united kingdom no april series a no lingens v austria cited above barfod v denmark february series a no janowski v poland cited above and news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see jersild v denmark september series a no the court further emphasises the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society although the press must not overstep certain bounds particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information its duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities information and ideas on all matters of public interest see jersild v denmark cited above de haes and gijsels v belgium february reports of judgments and decisions i and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii not only do the media have the task of imparting such information and ideas the public also has a right to receive them see sunday times v the united kingdom no cited above the safeguard afforded by article to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism see bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway cited above in addition the court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no and bladet tromsø and stensaas loc cit the limits of permissible criticism are wider as regards a politician than as regards a private individual unlike the latter the former inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their words and deeds by journalists and the public at large and they must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance see for example lingens v austria cited above incal v turkey june reports of judgments and decisions iv and castells v spain april series a no similar considerations apply also to persons in the public eye see fayed v the united kingdom september series a no b steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii and contrast with von hannover v germany no echr vi and mgn limited v the united kingdom no january in certain circumstances even where a person is known to the general public he or she may rely on a legitimate expectation of protection of and respect for his or her private life see von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr moreover the court has recently set out the relevant principles to be applied when examining the necessity of an instance of interference with the right to freedom of expression in the interests of the protection of the reputation or rights of others it noted that in such cases the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see axel springer ag v germany gc no february and mgn limited v the united kingdom cited above in von hannover v germany no gc cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above the court defined the contracting states margin of appreciation and its own role in balancing these two conflicting interests the court went on to identify a number of criteria as being relevant where the right of freedom of expression is being balanced against the right to respect for private life see von hannover v germany no gc cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above namelyi contribution to a debate of general interestii how wellknown is the person concerned and what is the subject of the reportiii prior conduct of the person concernediv method of obtaining the information and its veracitycircumstances in which the photographs were takenv content form and consequences of the publication andvi severity of the sanction imposed turning to the facts of the present case the court notes that the applicant was charged prosecuted and convicted of defamation in her capacity as a journalist and that she was ordered to pay damages and costs to ku the court observes at the outset that the article of july stated that po who was brutally killed in vantaa may have had connections with the businessman ku in po was captured trying to smuggle bags containing money from estonia into finland and the police suspected that those bags and their contents belonged to ku in that matter which was pending before the prosecutor for the consideration of charges po was suspected of an aggravated receiving offence and ku of aggravated debtors fraud a part of the homicide investigation was to investigate kus connection with the victim of the homicide kus full name and photograph were included in the article in order to assess whether the necessity of the restriction of the exercise of the freedom of expression has been established convincingly the court must examine whether the balancing exercise between the freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the court considers that the general subject matter which was at the heart of the article in question namely the criminal investigation into a homicide was clearly a matter of legitimate public interest having regard in particular to the serious nature of the crime from the point of view of the general publics right to receive information about matters of public interest and thus from the standpoint of the press there were justified grounds for reporting the matter to the public the court notes that according to the domestic courts it was equally clear that ku at the time the article was published had already been in the limelight there is no suggestion that details of the article or the photograph of ku were obtained by subterfuge or other illicit means compare von hannover v germany cited above on the contrary the article was based on information given by the authorities and kus photograph had been taken at a public event moreover the court observes that the facts set out in the article in issue were not in dispute even before the domestic courts there is no evidence or indeed any allegation of factual errors misrepresentation or bad faith on the part of the applicant see in this connection flinkkilä and others v finland no april however the court notes that the impugned article was entitled the victim of the vantaa homicide had connections with ku although it was phrased as a question according to the domestic courts the title created a connection between ku and the homicide implying that he was involved in it in the text of the article this allegation was alleviated by stating that the victim of the homicide might have had such connections the domestic courts noted that for the reader however this information only appeared in the text of the article moreover it was also of importance for the domestic courts that in the title ku was alleged to have connections with the victim of the crime even though it was specifically stated in the text of the article that the homicide suspect had no connections with ku this information only appeared towards the end of the article the court notes that the court of appeal found in its judgment that the applicant must have considered it probable that her article contained a false insinuation and that this false insinuation was capable of causing suffering to ku the court would in this context refer to the principle of presumption of innocence under article of the convention and to emphasise that this principle may be relevant also in article contexts in situations in which nothing is clearly stated but only insinuated compare and contrast ruokanen and others v finland no april in sum the juxtaposition of two unrelated criminal investigations with headlines which clearly suggested to the ordinary reader that there was more to pos murder than what was actually being stated in the text of the articles was defamatory implying that ku was somehow responsible for pos murder it amounted to stating by innuendo a fact which was highly damaging to the reputation of ku at no time did the applicant attempt to prove the truth of the insinuated fact nor did she plead that the insinuation was a fair comment based on relevant facts the court further notes that in its judgment the district court examined the conflicting interests of freedom of expression and the right to privacy referring to the constitution as well as to article of the convention the court also made reference to a supreme court precedent in which that court referring to the relevant caselaw of the court had found that freedom of expression did not justify violation of a persons honour or private life by upholding the district courts judgment the court of appeal also accepted this reasoning the court therefore considers that the domestic courts in their analysis attached sufficient importance to the applicants right to freedom of expression and balanced it in an adequate way against kus right to reputation finally the court has taken into account the severity of the sanctions imposed on the applicant the applicant was convicted under criminal law and was ordered to pay dayfines amounting to eur she was also ordered to pay ku jointly and severally with her codefendant eur for suffering and eur in legal costs no other sanctions or financial consequences were imposed moreover the court notes that according to the domestic law no entry of the conviction was made on the applicants criminal record as the sanction imposed only concerned a fine the court finds the sanction imposed reasonable compare and contrast flinkkilä and others v finland cited above and lahtonen v finland no january therefore in conclusion in the courts opinion the reasons relied on by the domestic courts were relevant and sufficient to show that the interference complained of was necessary in a democratic society having regard to all the foregoing factors including the margin of appreciation afforded to the state in this area the court considers that the domestic courts struck a fair balance between the competing interests at stake there has therefore been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on april pursuant to rule and of the rules of court fatoş aracıineta ziemele deputy registrar president,,,
26,the first applicant was born in and lives in helsinki the applicant company has its seat in helsinki the applicants a publisher and a publishing company wrote and published together with the former girlfriend of the prime minister at the time an autobiographical book about her relationship with the prime minister the book described a period of nine months in their lives from the point of view of the girlfriend a single mother the prime minister had earlier divorced his wife the book described the dating couples life and their intimate interaction the book was published on february the prime minister held office from june to june when he stepped down on october the public prosecutor brought charges under chapter section of the penal code against the first applicant and the girlfriend for having disclosed information about the prime ministers private life yksityiselämää loukkaavan tiedon levittäminen spridande av information som kränker privatlivet he also requested that the proceeds of the crime received by the applicant company be ordered forfeit to the state in accordance with chapter section of the penal code the prime minister concurred with the charges brought by the public prosecutor against the first applicant he also pursued a compensation claim against the first applicant which was joined to the criminal charges the girlfriend has lodged a separate application with the court see ruusunen v finland no on february the book was withdrawn from sale on march the helsinki district court käräjäoikeus tingsrätten after having voted dismissed the charges against the first applicant and rejected the request that the proceeds of the crime received by the applicant company be ordered forfeit to the state it found that the book disclosed a lot of information about the prime ministers private life but that he had already widely disclosed information about his family and habits as well as about his relationship with the girlfriend even though he himself had published an autobiography in had given several interviews ran a blog and even permitted photographs to be taken at his home he was known as a politician who strictly controlled his public image the book also contained some information which had not previously been disclosed to the public in this respect the court found that these new details only completed the information the prime minister had disclosed earlier it was never suggested that the facts disclosed were not true the book covered a period of nine months in the girlfriends and the prime ministers private life the court found that the girlfriend had the right to recount her private life she also described the prime minister his actions and family in a compassionate manner the court found that even though the information disclosed in the book had no direct relevance to the prime ministers political functions or his hierarchical position in the state it had relevance as far as the prime ministers person was concerned the constitution required that ministers were known to be honest and competent moreover the book described a situation in which two different realities of present day finnish society met a wealthy party leader and prime minister on the one hand and a single mother with everyday money problems on the other hand the court found that the fact that the girlfriend was writing about her life and her relationship with one of the highest authorities in the country did not restrict but in fact widened her freedom of expression when weighing the freedom of expression against the protection of private life the court found that the need to resort to criminal liability decreased when the disclosed information became more widely known criminal liability was the last resort in guiding human behaviour and its use had to be proportionate the court could therefore not hold that the publication of the applicants book was a criminal act moreover as the first applicant had obtained an opinion from a lawyer before publishing the book he could not be regarded as having acted with intent and could not therefore be considered as a perpetrator by letter dated april the public prosecutor appealed to the helsinki appeal court hovioikeus hovrätten the prime minister also appealed on february the helsinki appeal court convicted the first applicant for disseminating information violating personal privacy and sentenced him to dayfines in total euros he was ordered to pay the prime minister euros plus interest for nonpecuniary damage and euros plus interest for his costs and expenses before the district court and the appeal court the proceeds of the crime euros were ordered forfeit to the state the applicant company was to receive euros as compensation for its costs and expenses before the district court the court found that the passages in the book concerning the prime ministers intimate dating and his childrens feelings and behaviour unnecessarily violated the core areas of his protected private life he had not previously disclosed these details of his private life in the media the fact that he had disclosed some parts of his private life the protection of which was due to his status much narrower than a private persons did not mean that he could not benefit at all from any protection of his private life he had thus not waived his right to the protection of private life nor implicitly consented to the disclosure of information concerning details of his private life even though the girlfriend had the right to write about her private life disclosure of intimate details of another persons private life always required his or her consent the aim of the applicants book had been to discuss matters of private life and it had no relevance to the prime ministers political functions or his hierarchical position in the state nor had it any relevance to the assessment of his personal qualities such as any lack of honesty and judgment as the relationship fell within the core areas of his private life and had no relevance to his position as prime minister moreover the first applicant could be held as a perpetrator even though he had obtained a legal opinion about the book before its publication his acts had been intentional by letter dated april the applicants appealed to the supreme court korkein oikeus högsta domstolen requesting that the court establish a precedent in the case as the court had not yet in its caselaw assessed freedom of expression in the context of an autobiography on june the supreme court granted the applicants leave to appeal on june the supreme court after having held an oral hearing upheld the appeal courts conviction but quashed the forfeiture in respect of the first applicant and reduced the costs and expenses to be paid to the prime minister for the proceedings before the district court and the appeal court to euros plus interest the first applicant was ordered to pay the prime minister euros plus interest for his costs and expenses before the supreme court the applicant company was to receive euros as compensation for its costs and expenses before that court in particular by referring extensively to the courts caselaw the supreme court gave a more narrow scope to the prime ministers private life than the appeal court the court found that information about the prime ministers sex life and intimate events and his childrens feelings and behaviour had not been disclosed to the public before the fact that some details of his private life had been disclosed before did not mean that they could not fall within the scope of criminal liability under chapter section of the penal code the prime minister had not waived his right to protection of private life in these respects nor had he given his consent to their publication by consenting to the use of his photograph on the cover of the book the court considered contrary to the appeal court that the information about how and when the prime minister had met the girlfriend and how quickly their relationship had developed had had relevance to general public discussion as these issues had raised the question of whether in this respect he had been dishonest and lacked judgment also the information concerning the great differences in the standard of living between the girlfriend and the prime minister his lifestyle the data protection concerns and the protection of the highest political authorities in general had had relevance to general public discussion the court found also that disclosure of information about the prime ministers children was not conducive to causing him damage suffering and contempt as the girlfriend had only given her own interpretation of the childrens attitudes however the only references which according to the court had illegally disclosed information about the prime ministers private life were the information and hints about the sex life and intimate events between the girlfriend and the prime minister the court enumerated in particular seven parts of the book which contained information about the start of the sex life in the beginning of their relationship descriptions of their brief and passionate intimate moments as well as giving massages to each other and accounts of their sexual intercourse the court found that such information and hints fell within the core area of private life and their unauthorised publication was conducive of causing the prime minister suffering and contempt it was thus necessary to restrict the applicants freedom of expression in this respect in order to protect the prime ministers private life ii relevant domestic lawa constitution article of the constitution of finland suomen perustuslaki finlands grundlag act no guarantees everyones right to private life

made in the criminal records as provided by decree on court decisions whereby a finnish citizen or a foreigner permanently resident in finland has been sentenced abroad to a penalty equivalent to one mentioned in paragraph the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicants complained under article of the convention that their right to freedom of expression had been violated when the first applicant had been convicted of disclosing information about somebody elses private life article of the convention reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the government argued that the applicant company could not be considered a victim within the meaning of article of the convention the district court had rejected the public prosecutors request that the court declare the criminal proceeds forfeit to the state this decision had been upheld by the appeal court and the supreme court moreover the applicant company had received compensation of euros for its legal expenses the domestic courts had never ordered the applicant company to withdraw the book from sale nor had any attempts been made to prevent its sale accordingly the applicant company had not been able to show that it had been a victim of the alleged violation therefore this part of the application should be declared incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the convention in any event the government argued that the applicant had not suffered significant disadvantage and that the complaint should therefore be declared inadmissible the applicants argued that the applicant company had suffered a significant loss of income since when the present case commenced at the national level its commercial activity had practically come to an end it could thus be considered a victim the court notes that the forfeiture request directed against the applicant company was rejected by the district court upheld by the higher instances no forfeiture thus ever took place in respect of the applicant company the applicant company also received reasonable compensation for its costs and expenses before the domestic courts moreover the applicant company was never ordered by the domestic courts to withdraw the book from the market but was able to keep it on sale the possible financial losses suffered by the applicant company can not therefore be attributed to the state but appear to be caused by the actions taken by the applicant company itself in these circumstances the court considers that the applicant company can not be considered a victim as it is not directly affected by the alleged violation of article of the convention the court therefore accepts the governments preliminary objection and declares this complaint as far as the applicant company is concerned inadmissible pursuant to article a and of the convention for being incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the convention as concerns the governments second preliminary objection alleging insignificant disadvantage the court considers that this objection is closely related to the merits of the first applicants complaint it will therefore examine this preliminary objection together with the merits of the case the court therefore concludes that this complaint as far as the first applicant is concerned is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions the first applicant noted that there had clearly been an interference with his right to freedom of expression he contended that the domestic legal framework did not offer justification or basis for denying him his freedom of expression the legal framework should have also taken into account the courts caselaw which took primacy over the domestic law as the balancing exercise had not been carried out in accordance with the courts caselaw the interference had not been prescribed by law the first applicant maintained that a prime minister was an even more public figure than normal politicians and that all aspects of his or her life related to his or her functions for example the fact that the former prime minister had not publicly admitted that he had been using internet dating services had raised questions about his suitability for office and about the soundness of his judgment it had been generally recognised by the domestic courts and the government that the impugned book had not criticised the former prime minister but was rather a tender account of a relationship the veracity of the details disclosed in the book had never been questioned nor had this information been obtained by inappropriate means nothing suggested that the interference was justified on the grounds of the application of the margin of appreciation of the member state as to the balancing exercise the first applicant noted that the supreme court had concluded that the book taken as a whole did not shock or offend even though some parts of it did those parts only referred to rather normal human behaviour between couples the former prime minister had consented to the publishing of a photograph on the cover of the book this photograph already indicated tenderness and sexuality the behaviour which the supreme court had found offensive including references to taking sauna baths related to normal behaviour in the finnish cultural context in addition no details were ever given such conduct as part of two finnish persons life together did not subject the former prime minister or anybody else to negative publicity or personal suffering as such conduct was inherent in finnish culture moreover the first applicant also maintained that the sanctions imposed were not necessary or legitimate in the terms of the convention and that these sanctions were criminal in nature the government agreed that the first applicants conviction the fines imposed on him and the obligation to pay compensation and legal expenses to the former prime minister constituted an interference with his right to freedom of expression however the interference had a basis in finnish law in particular in chapter section of the penal code which fulfilled the criteria of precision clarity and foreseeability the first applicant had consulted a lawyer before publishing the book and he had thus been aware of the legal risks connected with the publishing the interference was thus prescribed by law and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the private life and reputation of others as to the necessity the government noted that the present case did not concern political debate but concerned the ninemonth relationship of the then prime minister and his former girlfriend told from the latters point of view the first applicant had written substantial parts of the book at least the epilogue as the expected public interest in the book had been based mainly on the publishing of private information about the former prime minister the publication rather constituted a memoirsstyle exposé than an autobiography although dating fell within the scope of private life it could in the context of a prime minister involve public interest of a kind that justified the right of the public at large to be informed about the dating that information could influence the opinion of the public at large of a prime minister and of his or her ability to perform his or her official duties the government noted that the supreme court had held in the present case that the information about how and where the relationship between the former prime minister and his former girlfriend had begun had not been insignificant from the public point of view the court had further noted that a politicians family life dating and other activities as a private person could be the object of justified public interest this was the case especially when knowledge about a politicians private life had a relevant connection with questions raised by him or her in societal activities behaviour that was not directly connected with the politicians performance in public office or duty or other societal activities could be relevant for assessing the persons qualities required for these activities the supreme court had pointed out that a prime minister enjoyed a narrower protection of his or her private life than a private individual the government maintained that although a politician had to tolerate more criticism judgment and public interest in him or her than a private individual a politician also enjoyed a sphere of privacy and was entitled to demand that it be respected the government noted that although the public at large could be considered to have the right to receive information about a prime ministers private life no particular grounds warranted expanding this right to encompass information about his or her intimate life the supreme court had defined in the present case that sex life and details of intimate events fell within the core area of private life not even a leading politicians private life and especially its core area could be excluded from the protection of private life in this respect the protection of privacy had superseded the freedom of expression the supreme court had not considered the book when assessed as a whole to violate the privacy of the former prime minister on the contrary the court had noted that the former prime minister himself had disclosed many of the facts discussed in the book the supreme court held that only the references to the sex life and intimate events between the former prime minister and his girlfriend had violated the privacy of the former the first applicant should have had his consent to describe them although the former prime ministers consent to use his photograph on the cover of the book was requested and received this consent and the fact that he had not tried to prevent the publication of the book had not meant that he had given tacit consent to publish the information presented in the book the government further noted that it had been public knowledge that the former prime minister had tried to protect his privacy and had been particular about what kind of information to disclose although he had in some contexts permitted for instance his children to be photographed and had described his home life and relationships he had not disclosed information about his sex life or any other intimate details to the public thus this information had not previously appeared in the public sphere the fact that the content and the tone of the description of his private life had not been insulting was without significance disclosing the information discussed above could not be considered to have contributed to a societally important or relevant debate but had instead served to satisfy the curiosity of a particular readership the book had sold several thousand copies and might still be available in some bookstores accordingly a large number of people nationally had become aware of the details of his intimate life finally the government maintained that the dayfines imposed on the first applicant had been lower than the fines imposed in previous finnish cases even though he was a publishing professional the impugned measures taken had thus not been disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued the government further noted that imprisonment had not even been requested by the prosecutor or the former prime minister moreover the supreme court had in its judgment fully recognized that the present case had involved a conflict between the right to impart ideas and information on one hand and the reputation and rights of others on the other hand it had thus undertaken a balancing exercise in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw accordingly the supreme court had not failed to balance properly the various interests in the case and it had not transgressed its margin of appreciation the courts assessmenta whether there was an interference the court agrees that the first applicants conviction the fines imposed on him and the obligation to pay compensation as well as costs and expenses to the former prime minister constituted an interference with his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the conventionb whether it was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim the court notes that according to the government the impugned measures had a basis in finnish law namely in chapter section of the penal code moreover the interference complained of had a legitimate aim namely the protection of the private life and reputation of others on the contrary the first applicant appears to argue that chapter section of the penal code fails to meet the standards of the courts caselaw as concerns the provision in question chapter section of the penal code the court has already found in the eerikäinen case see eerikäinen and others v finland no february in which the earlier provision of the penal code was at stake and in the reinboth case see reinboth and others v finland no january that it did not discern any ambiguity as to its contents the spreading of information an insinuation or an image depicting the private life of another person which was conducive to causing suffering qualified as an invasion of privacy furthermore the court notes that the exception in the second sentence of the provision concerning persons holding a public office or function or involved in professional life a political activity or in another comparable activity is equally clearly worded see flinkkilä and others v finland no april in respect of the earlier provision reinboth and others v finland cited above and saaristo and others v finland no october the court accepts therefore that the interference was prescribed by law see nikula v finland no echr ii selistö v finland no november karhuvaara and iltalehti v finland no echr x and eerikäinen and others v finland cited above in addition it has not been disputed that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others within the meaning of article c whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society according to the courts wellestablished caselaw freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article of the convention it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society this freedom is subject to the exceptions set out in article which must however be strictly construed the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly see for example lingens v austria july series a no and nilsen and johnsen v norway gc no echr viii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with a european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article see janowski v poland gc no echr i the courts task in exercising its supervision is not to take the place of national authorities but rather to review under article in the light of the case as a whole the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation see among many other authorities fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction the court must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case as a whole including the content of the remarks made by the applicant and the context in which she made them in particular it must determine whether the interference in issue was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient see sunday times v the united kingdom no april series a no lingens v austria cited above barfod v denmark february series a no janowski v poland cited above and news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see jersild v denmark september series a no the court further emphasises the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society although the press must not overstep certain bounds particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information its duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities information and ideas on all matters of public interest see jersild v denmark cited above de haes and gijsels v belgium february reports of judgments and decisions i and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii not only do the media have the task of imparting such information and ideas the public also has a right to receive them see sunday times v the united kingdom no cited above the safeguard afforded by article to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism see bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway cited above in addition the court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no and bladet tromsø and stensaas loc cit the limits of permissible criticism are wider as regards a politician than as regards a private individual unlike the latter the former inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their words and deeds by journalists and the public at large and they must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance see for example lingens v austria cited above incal v turkey june reports iv and castells v spain april series a no similar considerations apply also to persons in the public eye see fayed v the united kingdom september series a no b steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii and contrast with von hannover v germany no echr vi and mgn limited v the united kingdom no january in certain circumstances even where a person is known to the general public he or she may rely on a legitimate expectation of protection of and respect for his or her private life see von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr moreover the court has recently set out the relevant principles to be applied when examining the necessity of an instance of interference with the right to freedom of expression in the interests of the protection of the reputation or rights of others it noted that in such cases the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see axel springer ag v germany gc no february and mgn limited v the united kingdom cited above in von hannover v germany no gc cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above the court defined the contracting states margin of appreciation and its own role in balancing these two conflicting interests the court went on to identify a number of criteria as being relevant where the right of freedom of expression is being balanced against the right to respect for private life see von hannover v germany no gc cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above namelyi contribution to a debate of general interestii how wellknown is the person concerned and what is the subject of the reportiii prior conduct of the person concernediv method of obtaining the information and its veracitycircumstances in which the photographs were takenv content form and consequences of the publication andvi severity of the sanction imposed turning to the facts of the present case the court notes that the first applicant was convicted for disseminating information violating personal privacy and sentenced to dayfines totalling euros moreover he was ordered to pay compensation as well as costs and expenses to the former prime minister the court observes at the outset that the impugned book described a period of nine months in the life of the girlfriend of the prime minister at the time when she as a single mother dated the prime minister who had divorced his wife the book described the dating couples life and made reference to their intimate interaction even if the emphasis in the book was on describing the girlfriends private life the book also described as noted by the district court a situation in which two different realities of present day finnish society met a wealthy party leader and prime minister on the one hand and a single mother with everyday money problems on the other hand the court notes that the facts set out in the book in issue were not in dispute even before the domestic courts in fact the district court observed that it was never even suggested that the facts disclosed were not true the court notes that the facts in the book were presented in a compassionate manner and the style was not provocative or exaggerated there is no evidence or indeed any allegation of factual misrepresentation or bad faith on the part of the girlfriend or the first applicant see in this connection flinkkilä and others v finland cited above moreover the court notes that it was equally clear that the former prime minister had been at the time when the book was published a public figure he was thus expected to tolerate a greater degree of public scrutiny which may have a negative impact on his honour and reputation than a completely private person see paragraph above there is no suggestion that details of the book or the photograph of the former prime minister were obtained by subterfuge or other illicit means compare von hannover v germany cited above on the contrary the former prime ministers consent to the use of his photograph on the cover of the book had been requested and received in order to assess whether the necessity of the restriction of the exercise of the freedom of expression has been established convincingly the court must examine the issue essentially from the standpoint of the relevance and sufficiency of the reasons given by the domestic courts for convicting the first applicant and imposing a fine the court must determine whether his conviction and the criminal sanctions imposed on him struck a fair balance between the public and the former prime ministers interests and whether the standards applied were in conformity with the principles embodied in article see von hannover v germany no gc cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above the court considers that even though the emphasis in the book was on the girlfriends private life it nevertheless contained elements of public interest the supreme court considered contrary to the appeal court that the information about how and when the former prime minister had met the girlfriend and how quickly their relationship had developed had relevance to general public discussion as these issues raised the question of whether in this respect he had been dishonest and lacked judgment the supreme court also found that the information concerning the great differences in the standard of living between the girlfriend and the former prime minister his lifestyle the data protection concerns and the protection of the highest political authorities in general had relevance to general public discussion the court agrees with this from the point of view of the general publics right to receive information about matters of public interest there were thus justified grounds for publishing the book the court notes that the domestic courts also took into account that a majority of the information concerning the former prime ministers private life which was disclosed in the book had already been widely disclosed the former prime minister had disclosed information about his family and habits as well as about his relationship with the girlfriend and he had even published an autobiography in the supreme court also found that information about the former prime ministers sex life and intimate events and his childrens feelings and behaviour had not been disclosed to the public before however the supreme court found only the references to the sex life and intimate events between the girlfriend and the former prime minister illegal moreover the court observes that in their analysis the domestic courts attached importance both to the girlfriends and the first applicants right to freedom of expression as well as to the former prime ministers right to respect for his private life the domestic courts examined the case in conformity with principles embodied in article and the criteria laid down in the courts recent caselaw all domestic courts and especially the supreme court balanced in their reasoning the first applicants right to freedom of expression against the former prime ministers right to reputation by considering them from the point of view of pressing social need and proportionality the supreme court also narrowed down the scope of the problematic passages in the book it enumerated only certain parts of the book which it considered to contain information falling within the core area of the private life of the former prime minister see paragraph above the supreme court found that such information and hints and their unauthorised publication was conducive of causing the former prime minister suffering and contempt according to the supreme court it was thus necessary to restrict the applicants freedom of expression in this respect in order to protect the former prime ministers private life the court finds this reasoning acceptable the restrictions of the exercise of the applicants freedom of expression were established convincingly by the supreme court taking into account the courts caselaw the court recalls its recent caselaw according to which the court would require in such circumstances strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see von hannover v germany no gc cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above finally the court has taken into account the severity of the sanctions imposed on the first applicant the first applicant was convicted under criminal law and was ordered to pay dayfines amounting to euros moreover he was ordered to pay euros plus interest for nonpecuniary damage and euros plus interest as costs and expenses to the former prime minister moreover the court notes that according to the domestic law no entry of the conviction was made on the first applicants criminal record as the sanction imposed only concerned a fine see paragraph above the court finds the sanctions imposed reasonable compare and contrast flinkkilä and others v finland cited above and lahtonen v finland no january except the obligation to pay the costs and expenses of the former prime minister however this ground alone is not sufficient for the court to reach another conclusion in conclusion in the courts opinion the reasons relied on by the domestic courts were both relevant and sufficient to show that the interference complained of was necessary in a democratic society having regard to all the foregoing factors and taking into account the margin of appreciation afforded to the state in this area the court considers that the domestic courts struck a fair balance between the competing interests at stake there has therefore been no violation of article of the convention for the above reasons the court considers that there is no longer any need to take a stand on the governments preliminary objection based on insignificant disadvantage ii remainder of the application the applicants also complained under article of the convention that they had not been allowed to question a witness during the appeal court proceedings as that court had not held an oral hearing moreover the charges had been unspecified as no passages of the book had been identified in the light of all the material in its possession and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence the court finds that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the convention or its protocols accordingly this part of the application must be rejected as manifestly illfounded and declared inadmissible pursuant to article a and of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the first applicants complaint concerning article of the convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on january pursuant to rule and of the rules of court françoise elens passos ineta ziemele registrar president,,,
27,springer se is a publishing house carrying on business in the legal form of a societas europea registered in berlin the applicant company was represented by mr j hegemann and ms l schopp lawyers practising in berlin the government were represented by one of their agents mr hj behrens of the federal ministry of justice and consumer protection the facts of the case may be summarised as follows the applicant company publishes the daily newspaper die welt on october it published an article under the headline the stasi woman by gregor gysis side die stasi frau an gregor gysis seite mr gysi was at the time a member of the german parliament and chairperson of the political party die linke formerly the pds the article stated that ms k the partys executive director had been an agent for the former gdrs ministry of state security ministerium für staatssicherheit commonly referred to as the stasi it also addressed the disappearance following the fall of the communist regime in of vast assets that had belonged to the east german communist party sed the article was published on page of the newspaper and in so far as relevant read as follows she sits on the federal arbitration commission of die linke furthermore the name k stands for a particularly unsavoury chapter in the partys history the handling of billions in sed assets after the peaceful revolution in the gdr even at the end of the sed still possessed a convoluted business empire extensive real estate holdings and billion east german marks in cash there could still be secret bank accounts all over the world there is currently no evidence that k was involved in possible criminal activities but according to documents in our possession she remains involved directly or indirectly with a number of companies whose assets stem from the heritage of the honeckerparty according to the commercial register k holds shares in the abovementioned companies as a private individual but in the berlin higher administrative court found that two of the companies in which she holds stakes manage assets for the pds on a fiduciary basis the pds as successor to the sed placed the utmost confidence in k under its newly elected leader gysi the party had a major problem in the early s the periodical neues deutschland new germany or nd the partys former mouthpiece was on the brink suddenly the association of friends of the nd appeared and promised large sums of money at least one million deutschmarks some media accounts even mentioned four million who was supposed to raise the funds and where they stemmed from is not known honorary chairwoman of the friends of the nd k on october two days before the articles publication the applicant company sent a list of questions to k addressing inter alia her membership in the association of friends of the nd k refused to answer the questions on october ks lawyer requested the applicant company to publish a rectification regarding the passages from the article cited above in her reply k stated notably that she had not been involved in the disappearance of sed assets when the applicant company refused to publish the reply on october k lodged an application for an injunction with the berlin regional court on october the court dismissed her application it found that the impugned article had not made the alleged connection between k and the disappearance of sed assets it further found that the fact that the text could be interpreted in such a way was insufficient to warrant a rectification k appealed against the decision on november the court of appeal informed her lawyer of its doubts regarding the length of her reply and a revised text was submitted on november the court of appeal relying on section of the berlin press act see paragraph below allowed the application for an injunction and ordered the applicant company to publish the following rectification you write about me she sits on the partys federal arbitration commission thats wrong since january i have not been a member of the commission you write the name k stands for a chapter in the partys history the handling of the seds assets worth billions after the peaceful revolution in the gdr even at the end of the sed still possessed a convoluted business empire extensive real estate holdings and billion east german marks in cash there could still be secret bank accounts all over the world there is currently no evidence that k was involved in possible criminal activities but according to documents in our possession she remains involved directly or indirectly in a number of companies whose assets stem from the heritage of the honeckerparty k holds shares in those companies as a private individual but according to the findings reached by the berlin higher administrative court in two companies in which she holds stakes manage assets for the pds on a fiduciary basis you identify those companies as fevac and vulkan in this regard i note i had nothing to do with the disappearance of the sed party assets after fevac and vulkan were founded in with money from the pds on the recommendation and with the approval of the treuhandanstalt an agency established by the gdr government to privatise state enterprises prior to german reunification i became a shareholder in fevac in you write the pds as successor to the sed placed utmost confidence in k under its newly elected leader gysi the party had a major problem in the early s the periodical new germany neues deutschland or nd the former party mouthpiece was on the brink suddenly the association of friends of the nd appeared and promised large sums of money at least one million deutschmarks some media accounts even mentioned four million who was supposed to raise the funds and where they stemmed from is not known honorary chairwoman of the friends of the nd kin this regard i note i have only been a member of this association since around and i have held the chair since berlin october j eisenberg counsel for k in the subsequent main proceedings on december the berlin regional court again dismissed ks application for an injunction essentially for the same reasons as those on which it had relied previously see paragraph above again k lodged an appeal in response the applicant company argued inter alia that k had no legitimate interest in respect of the matter addressed by the third point of her reply see paragraph above since prior to the publication of the article she had refused to answer the applicant companys question regarding her membership of the nd see paragraph above furthermore the text of her reply was dated october whereas the latest version had only been submitted to the applicant company on december it further argued that the information about the two abovementioned companies that k had provided in her reply had been unnecessary for the purposes of the rectification on january the court of appeal again ordered the applicant company to publish ks reply the court ordered that the reply be printed on page of the newspaper and rejected ks demand for a frontpage announcement of the rectification it considered that although the article had not explicitly alleged that k had concealed sed party assets such a conclusion would be reached by the average reader the article had linked ks name with the disappearance of sed party assets after the statement contained in the article that there was no evidence for any criminal activities had not offset the implication that k had been involved in the disappearance of the assets since it had been presented alongside the information that k had maintained and continued to maintain ties to companies that had been funded with party assets regarding the length and content of the rectification the court of appeal noted that the wording of the rectification had been limited to what was necessary to refute the impugned statements contained in the original article given the level of detail provided in the article about

for the effective protection of honour and reputation every publisher and every newspaper motion picture radio and television company shall have a person responsible who is not protected by immunities or special privileges the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant company complained that being ordered to publish the rectification had violated its freedom of expression under article of the convention which in so far as relevant reads everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or rights of others or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible merits the parties submissionsa the applicant company the applicant company maintained that the article had in fact not associated k with the disappearance of sed party assets and had contained no hidden allegations in this regard rather it had clearly stated that there was no evidence for ks involvement in any criminal activities the assessment that the name k stands for a particularly unsavoury chapter in the partys history the handling of billions in sed assets after the peaceful revolution in the gdr did not contain a factual allegation but rather a value judgment to the effect that k was a financial beneficiary of the sed dictatorship a rectification should thus have been excluded furthermore the applicant company argued that ks conduct prior to the publication of the impugned article had not been properly taken into account it would have been a simple task for k to answer the applicant companys question regarding the duration of her time as chair of the association of friends of the nd since this information did not incriminate her in any way but was not publicly available however since she had chosen to withhold this information from the applicant company see paragraph above she could not have legitimately requested a rectification in this regard lastly the sanction imposed on the applicant company by the court order had to be considered to have been even more severe than the order to publish the rectification itself since the applicant company had been ordered to publish the rectification with an incorrect date the courtordered rectification had still carried the date of ks original request to the applicant company october despite the fact that the text had undergone several modifications and the final version had only been submitted to the applicant company on december this discrepancy had endangered the applicant companys reputation since its readers had been led to conclude that the applicant company had deliberately delayed the publication of the rectificationb the government with regard to the content of the article the government agreed with the domestic courts view that the impugned article contained the covert assertion that k had been involved in the disappearance of sed party assets the reservation in the article that no evidence of criminal activities existed had merely pointed to a lack of proof but had done nothing to offset the allegation furthermore the government submitted that ks refusal to answer a journalists questions could not have cast doubt on the legitimacy of ks interest in subsequently lodging a request for a rectification a different interpretation of the law would essentially result in the press having a right to information that it could level against any private individual the government lastly asserted that such a discrepancy between the date of the rectification and its publication see paragraph above was not unusual and would not have caught the average readers attention the thirdparty interveners submissions k emphasised that together with the rectification the applicant company had published an editors note confirming the veracity of ks reply see paragraph above in her view this meant that the applicant companys decision to lodge an application with the court had been contradictory and that it had not had any need for legal protection furthermore given that the inaccuracy of the information contained in the article had not been contested by either party the order to publish a rectification could not be considered to have constituted a very serious infringement of the applicant companys rights the courts assessment neither party disputes that the domestic courts order to publish a rectification constituted an interference by the state with the applicant companys right to freedom of expression the court further notes that the interference was prescribed by law namely by section of the berlin press act see paragraph above it served the purpose of protecting the reputation of k and therefore pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others within the meaning of article of the convention it remains to be established whether the interference was necessary in a democratic societya general principles an interference will be considered necessary in a democratic society for a legitimate aim if it answers a pressing social need and in particular if it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and if the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient see for example bagirov v azerbaijan nos and june and mp v finland no december the press plays an essential role in a democratic society in determining whether in the present case the interference with the applicant companys rights was necessary in a democratic society the court thus observes at the outset that as a general principle newspapers and other privatelyowned media must be free to exercise editorial discretion in deciding whether to publish articles comments and letters submitted by private individuals the court has held that the legal obligation to publish a rectification may be considered a normal element of the legal framework governing the exercised of the freedom of expression by the media see kaperzyński v poland no april rusu v romania no march marunić v croatia no and march at the same time it has stressed that given the high level of protection enjoyed by the press there need to be exceptional circumstances in which a newspaper may legitimately be required to publish for example a retraction an apology or a judgment in a defamation case see melnychuk v ukraine dec no echr ix and eker v turkey no october in this respect the potential chilling effect of the penalties imposed on the press in the performance of its task as a purveyor of information and public watchdog in the future must also be taken into consideration see mutatis mutandis radio twist as v slovakia no echr xv in respect of interference with the right to impart information the convention organs have held that the aim of the right to reply is to afford everyone the possibility of protecting him or herself against certain statements or opinions disseminated by the mass media that are likely to be injurious to his or her private life honour or dignity see ediciones tiempo v spain no commission decision of july decisions and reports p in this regard the court reiterates that the primary objective of the right of reply is to allow individuals to challenge false information published about them in the press see gülen v turkey dec nos september see also the recommendations of the committee of ministers of the council of europe quoted in paragraphs above as to the relevant criteria the court will take into consideration whether there exists a sufficient connection between the statement in question and the requested rectification and whether the latter can be considered to constitute a proportionate reaction see the above cited cases of eker and melnychuk one relevant aspect for this assessment is the content of the reply in comparison with the impugned statement see eker cited above furthermore the court has taken into account whether publication of the reply would constitute a punishable offence ibid in the circumstances of the present case the court will also have regard to whether the length of the reply exceeds what is necessary to correct the information containing the facts claimed to be inaccurate and the timeframe within which the request for a rectification was made see also the appendix to the resolution of the committee of ministers of the council of europe paragraph above while it is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment in all these respects the final evaluation of whether the interference is necessary remains subject to review by the court for conformity with the requirements of the convention a margin of appreciation must be left to the relevant national authorities in this assessment the breadth of this margin varies and depends on a number of factors including the nature of the convention right in issue its importance for the individual the nature of the interference and the object pursued by the interference there will usually be a wide margin of appreciation if the state is required to strike a balance between competing private and public interests or different convention rights see klaus müller v germany no november with further references in cases like the present one which require the right to respect for private life to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression the court considers that the outcome of the application should not in theory vary according to whether it has been lodged with the court under article of the convention by the person who was the subject of the news report or under article by the publisher indeed as a matter of principle these rights deserve equal respect accordingly the margin of appreciation should in theory be the same in both cases see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no june where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts ibid b application of these principles to the present case in examining the necessity of the interference in the light of the abovementioned principles and considerations regard needs to be given to the object content length and timing of the rectification for this purpose the following aspects inter alia should be taken into account see also paragraph above the existence of a legitimate interest in a rectification owing to the content and dissemination of the impugned statement whether a sufficient connection exists between the rectification and the impugned statement and the proportionality of the rectification in respect of its content and length the placing of the rectification and any delay between the publication of the article and the lodging of the request for a rectification regarding the question of a legitimate interest the court firstly notes the different interpretations of the article reached by the national courts in the regional courts opinion the article had not connected k to the disappearance of sed party assets in such a manner as to require a rectification see paragraph above in the same vein the applicant company argued that the original text had contained no such allegation either direct or indirect rather the statement linking k to the disappearance of sed party assets had constituted a mere value judgement see paragraph above the court of appeal however considered that the average reader would understand the article as implying that k had been involved in the disappearance of sed party assets and that the article thus made a statement of fact see paragraph above in this regard the court notes that under the relevant domestic law see paragraph above a rectification may only be requested in respect of factual allegations the court reiterates that its task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities but rather to review under article of the convention the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation see bédat v switzerland gc no iii march the court has recognised that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider with regard to a politician acting in his public capacity than in relation to a private individual see lingens v austria july series a no and oberschlick v austria no may series a no however this requirement of tolerance does not involve a duty to tolerate factual inaccuracies the court observes that in assessing the content of the article the court of appeal took account notably of the divergent statements in the article to the effect that ks name was linked to the disappearance of sed party assets but that no evidence linked her to any criminal activities in the courts view the court of appeal gave a lengthy and wellreasoned assessment of the articles content and its interpretation showed no signs of arbitrariness accordingly its finding that k had a legitimate interest in the requested rectification does not raise concerns moreover in the light of the appellate courts interpretation the court notes that the requested rectification had a sufficient connection to the impugned article with regard to the applicant companys argument that the domestic courts should have refused ks request for a rectification on the basis of her refusal to answer its questions see paragraph above the court reiterates that a persons conduct prior to publication will only reduce his or her legitimate expectation regarding the effective protection of his or her private life under specific circumstances see axel springer ag v germany gc no february with further references usually such a consequence will require the person concerned to have sought the limelight himself ibidem or result from the persons own illicit actions such as for example the commission of a criminal offence see mikolajová v slovakia no january the court observes moreover that while press organs are held to report in good faith in order to provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the ethics of journalism see axel springer ag cited above and thus should give the person concerned the chance to defend him or herself the fact that the impugned allegations were communicated does not confer unrestricted freedom to publish unverified allegations neither does it preclude the right of reply of the person concerned in order to correct facts claimed to be inaccurate therefore and taking into account that the applicant companys argument does not concern any illicit behaviour on the part of k prior to the publication of the contested article her refusal to answer the applicant companys questions can not serve as an argument for limiting her right to a rectification of incorrect facts the court further observes that the statements in question were published in a daily newspaper see paragraph above there is no indication that there was an undue delay between the publication of the impugned article and the lodging of a request for a rectification see paragraphs and above with regard to the proportionality of the rectification order the court notes at the outset that there is a material difference between the rectification of facts claimed to be inaccurate and sanctions such as the prohibition on publication criminal sanctions and the order to pay damages for value judgements in defamation cases see mutatis mutandis lingens cited above and oberschlick cited above in determining the proportionality of the rectification order the court of appeal considered that the applicant company presented ks connection to companies with alleged ties to the sed in some detail accordingly it found that the information provided in ks reply in this regard had not exceeded what was necessary to counter the applicant companys allegations the court sees no reason to challenge this assessment it observes in addition that the rectification was to be printed on the same page as that on which the original article had appeared and that a request to have the rectification announced on the newspapers frontpage had been refused see paragraph above furthermore there is no indication that the length of ks reply exceeded the length of the statements in question see for a similar factual situation and a fortiori funke woman group gmb h v germany dec committee nos and december similarly nothing suggests that the publication of the reply constituted a punishable offence lastly the court notes that ks reply did not bear the date of the final version the applicant company had been ordered to publish but instead the date of ks original request to the applicant company see paragraph above in this regard the court of appeal considered that the discrepancy did not render the published information manifestly incorrect while the text of the original reply had been modified several times in order to alleviate the domestic courts legal concerns the core message of the reply was identical see paragraph above the court sees no reason to disagree with this assessment in the light of the aforementioned considerations the court finds that in assessing the circumstances submitted for its appreciation the court of appeal gave due consideration to the principles and criteria as laid down by the courts caselaw for balancing the right to respect for private life and the right to freedom of expression the court discerns no strong reasons that would require it to substitute its view for that of the court of appeal see the caselaw quoted in paragraph above accordingly there has been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on january pursuant to rule and of the rules of court ilse freiwirth

the applicants initial findings on krājbankas advertising and marketing expenses and subsequent audit reports on september the applicant prepared a report on the advertising and marketing expenses incurred by krājbanka in and the first seven months of which he then presented to the banks supervisory board his report was based on information which he had requested from the heads of the marketing and economics departments according to the applicants report the bank had transferred substantial sums for advertising and marketing services to inter alia z for which no supporting documents could be found this raised suspicions that the banks funds had been misappropriated the parties did not provide the court with a copy of the applicants report nor any further details of that report on october the banks supervisory board held an extraordinary meeting and ordered an internal audit to verify the applicants findings at a meeting of october the head of the internal audit department informed the supervisory board that no undocumented advertising and marketing expenses had been incurred in response to press reports see paragraphs et seq below the internal audit had verified all deals concluded with z in the internal audit in relation to was ongoing the information published in the press had not been confirmed the conclusions of the final report dated october indicated that in no undocumented advertising and marketing expenses had been incurred all contracted services had been received but on some occasions no supporting documents have been kept for example copies of certain advertisements in the press and some printed material such as concert posters and tickets were no longer available on october the supervisory board ordered an additional external audit in may the audit agency in its report concluded that while the advertising and marketing expenses incurred in latvian lati lvl approximately euros eur and lvl approximately eur had been greater than in previous years in the figure had been lvl approximately eur in lvl approximately eur and in lvl approximately eur this could be explained by the fact that the bank had been in the process of changing its corporate identity during the period under consideration this process had continued while the external audit was being carried out and the bank had incurred more expenses in this regard all contracts with z had been approved and signed by the banks highest management the external audit concluded that there was no evidence that payments had been made for services or goods that had not been received or that the payments had exceeded the value of the services received no personal links had been found between al or the banks staff members and the advertising companies there was no evidence that the staff members had been forced to work with the particular service provider or to prepare documents for services which the bank had not received meanwhile al applied to have criminal proceedings instituted in respect of the alleged intentional dissemination of false information about him by a final decision of august the prosecution refused to institute criminal proceedings the information and conclusions which the applicant had provided to the journalists had been based on erroneous findings contained in the applicants initial report on the advertising and marketing expenses however there was no evidence that the applicant had intentionally disseminated false information about al the latter was informed of his right to lodge a civil claim in that regard c newspaper articles in nra concerning al between august and may nra published numerous articles on various topics of public interest concerning the parliamentary elections it appears that nra journalists contacted the applicant for a comment shortly after the meeting of october of the banks supervisory board had taken place in their submissions to the court the parties disagreed on the manner and form in which the applicant had provided the respective information to the nra journalists the government stated that the applicant had provided this information to the journalists on several occasions and that his comments which had contained concrete descriptions of als actions had been provided in the form of facts susceptible of proof the applicant however stated that he had only on one occasion provided a short comment to the journalists via telephone about the issues discussed at the meeting of the banks supervisory board furthermore the comments had constituted merely his own opinion about krājbankas management they had still needed to be verified by the banks internal audit the following excerpts are from nine articles which were published between and october and which were based on the information provided by the applicant in this regard krājbankas former management accused of fraud since the beginning of lvl has been transferred to finance krājbankas advertising and marketing activities in respect of which no documentation the relevant contracts deliveryacceptance deeds etc has been provided the transfer of this sum in an unknown direction nezināmā virzienā actually amounts to the destruction of the banks available assets as the applicant suggested to nra either somebody is receiving this paid money back or krājbankas money is being used to create advertising of a completely different kind than that indicated in the available documents this is money that has been stolen from the shareholders the applicant stated moreover significant advance payments were made for services to be provided within a year shortly before a change in krājbankas management at the beginning of the supervisory board has ordered an internal audit to discover where these funds have disappeared to documents in the possession of nra show that the role of al in the affair of the strange advertising funds transfers could be quite significant the banks public relations unit has

lvl information published in nra october edition article written by rp and el krājbankas former management accused of fraud this week krājbankas current officials discovered massive excess expenditure

marketing activities in respect of which no documentation is available as the applicant admitted to nra z was the very agency to which more than lvl of krājbankas funds was transferred at the beginning of as an advance payment details of the subsequent expenditure of those funds are unknown it is possible that this is the money that provided the foundation for the latvias first partys sizable advertising campaign admitted the applicant documents in the possession of nra show that the role of al in the affair of the strange advertising funds transfers could have been rather significant information published in nra october edition article written by kp and el advertising for the pastors party with krājbankas money the applicant confirmed to nra that the advertising agency z the creator of latvias first partys advertising campaign is one of the companies to which the former management of krājbanka transferred more than lvl at the beginning of without documentary

al has a negative opinion of nras publications to date regarding the action of krājbankas former management in transferring hundreds of thousands of latvian lati to advertising firms without documentary certification in respect of the expenditure of that money nra has already repeatedly written about the longstanding battle among krājbankas shareholders during which al was accused several times of potentially unlawful actions this however has not prevented the friends of al from resorting to extreme methods nra was informed by the applicant that at the last meeting of the supervisory board a member of als group vd asked him in a forthright manner have the folks from ventspils insured your property this is an unprecedented event the chairman of the banks supervisory board being blatantly threatened admitted the applicant he believes that al is now speculating that he will soon be afforded immunity as a member of parliament preventing him from being criminally prosecuted without a majority vote of the parliament commenting on the value of marketing advertising and public relations contracts the applicant admitted that even though it is necessary to carry out indepth market research during als era various procedures were breached and payments were made whose sums currently can not be precisely determined nra has already written that lvl has been transferred to finance krājbankas advertising and marketing activities since the beginning of the year in respect of which no documentation the relevant contracts deliveryacceptance deeds etc has been provided

seeking compensation and the retraction of a total of thirtyone allegedly defamatory articles he also indicated that the applicant had provided false information to nra which had formed the basis of the abovementioned nine articles see paragraph above proceedings before the firstinstance court during a hearing of january the applicant admitted before the firstinstance court that the information concerning the possible misappropriation of krājbankas funds which he had provided to nra had proved to be incorrect he made the following statements the information was wrong unfounded as part of my duties i was carrying out my task of managing the banks activities i was not interested in als private life i have always respected him i tried to organise my work correctly as to the mistake regarding numbers there was one and i apologise to al and to the journalists al worked at the bank and worked in accordance with its budget al made decisions there were others responsible for the banks budget the bank did not overpay for its advertisements the mistake regarding numbers could not have offended als honour and dignity there were no public statements maybe there were other people who provided more information to the press on october the riga regional court rīgas apgabaltiesa delivered its judgment dismissing the claims against the applicant the court concluded that the nine articles in question see paragraph above which had been based on the information provided by the applicant had reported his personal opinion about the functioning of krājbanka and its management which could not be considered defamatory moreover no claim for defamatory information to be retracted was lodged against the applicant the claims against both publishers of nra preses nams and mediju nams were partly upheld in so far as they concerned six out of the nine articles which had been based on information provided by the applicant and six other articles reporting on other matters proceedings before the appellate court on may the civil cases chamber of the supreme court augstākās tiesas civillietu tiesu palāta after appeals by al preses nams and mediju nams reexamined the case and delivered a new judgment the judgment took immediate effect the appellate court noted that at the material time the press and other mass media had been widely reporting on the parliamentary elections that is to say the political parties and their leaders including the newlyestablished political party of which al was one of the leaders he had stood for election his candidacy had been widely advertised and it had been accordingly examined by the press and other mass media nra had published a series of articles about the money spent on the preelection advertising of the latvias first party linking the source of these funds to krājbanka and its former president al it had been reported that during his time in office lvl had been transferred for advertising and marketing purposes without any documentary proof thereof having been preserved and that this had been considered to constitute a misappropriation of the banks funds these funds had been spent on the partys largescale advertising as the applicant had put it this money has been stolen from the shareholders the nine articles had also contained other information provided by the applicant that during als time in office there had been breaches not only in relation to the advertising expenses but also other breaches in respect of banking operations payments without approval the administration of certificate accounts against the interests of the bank and the state the appellate court stated that the information contained in those articles about the use of krājbankas funds and transactions had been provided by the applicant who had mentioned specific sums and that the articles had contained references to his statements the appellate court found that since the applicant had provided this information to nra journalists he had to bear responsibility for giving and disseminating false information the court held that this information had not corresponded to the facts and that this had been acknowledged by the applicant himself during the hearing before the firstinstance court see paragraph above this had also been confirmed by the results of the external audit and by the prosecution see paragraphs and the court also held that the journalists had not had a responsibility to verify the accuracy of the provided information since the applicants status as the chairman of the supervisory board of krājbanka had created a legitimate expectation that the provided information was correct lastly the court found that even if the margin of permissible criticism in respect of al as a member of parliament was necessarily a wider one than would normally be the case the false information had nevertheless offended his honour and dignity as it had contained serious allegations of unlawful activities and had given the impression that al was a dishonest person given the above and in view of the seriousness of the interference and the applicants position in the bank the court ordered the applicant to pay compensation to al in connection with the nine articles in the amount of lvl approximately eur together with statutory interest per annum in addition the court upheld the claim against preses nams alone in respect of one other article and ordered it to pay compensation in the amount of lvl approximately eur together with statutory interest per annum the applicant and preses nams were also ordered to pay als legal costs in the amount of lvl approximately eur and lvl approximately eur respectively the appellate court dismissed als claims against preses nams and mediju nams as regards all the other articles that had not been based on any information provided by the applicant proceedings before the senate of the supreme court on june the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the senate of the supreme court augstākās tiesas senāts he did not contest that the information he had provided to the journalists had turned out not to be supported by evidence however this information had constituted his evaluation of the actions taken by krājbankas management as a whole he had not directly mentioned al by name surname or his position when giving the information to the journalists his allegations regarding the misappropriation of krājbankas funds could only have infringed the interests of the bank as a legal entity it could not have offended the honour and dignity of certain executives who had been under an obligation to inform the supervisory board and the mass media of the truth furthermore the applicant had provided the information in the form of a supposition by indicating that it still needed to be verified by the banks internal audit it was the nra journalists who had linked the applicants report with the allegations of wrongdoing by al thus the applicant could not be held responsible for the manner in which the journalists had decided to present this information since he had had no means of influencing this on january the senate of the supreme court delivered a new judgment which in essence upheld the appellate courts judgment the relevant parts of the judgement read as follows the appellate courts conclusion that the applicant had disseminated defamatory and false information was supported by the applicants own submissions before the firstinstance court in which he admitted that he had provided incorrect information to the journalists the fact that this information was not truthful was confirmed by the audit agency and the prosecution the applicant in his appeal on points of law did not contest these findings he merely noted that he was a source and could not influence the evaluation given by the journalists having examined the testimony of the nra journalists the appellate court found that the false information provided by the applicant had related not to krājbankas management as the applicant indicated but specifically to al as the then president of the bank thus infringing his honour and dignity the appellate court found that the journalists had had no reason to doubt the credibility of the information as it had been provided by the applicant in his capacity as chairman of the supervisory board of krājbanka and his position had undoubtedly created a legitimate expectation that this information was true accordingly the appellate court rightly held that the journalists had had no obligation to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the applicant al had requested compensation in the amount of lvl from the applicant by granting his claim the appellate court taking into account the scope of the distributed information and its audience rightly considered it justified the senate of the supreme court also upheld the claim against preses nams alone in respect of one other article they held that als honour and dignity had not been offended in other articles the appellate court had referred to the courts caselaw and had taken into account als status and the fact that he had refused to offer comment the appellate court had correctly applied the relevant principle that the journalistic freedom also covered possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation the senate referred to as diena and ozoliņš v latvia no july in this regard referring to section a of the civil law and section of the law on the mass media the senate of the supreme court ordered the applicant who had disseminated that defamatory information and not preses nams to retract the relevant parts of the articles in question see paragraph above the latter however still remained obliged to publish the retracted information ii relevant domestic lawa civil law section a of the civil law civillikums as worded at the material time provided that everyone had the right to bring proceedings with a view to retracting information which offended his or her honour and dignity if the disseminator of the information could not prove that such information was true if information that offended a persons honour and dignity was published in the press then in the event that such information was not true it should also be retracted in the press if someone unlawfully

from liability the mass media shall not be held liable for the dissemination of false information if it contains official documents of the state authorities and administrative bodies announcements by political and public organisations announcements by official information agencies publications by officials the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the appellate courts judgment of may upheld by the senate of the supreme court on january had constituted an unjustified interference with his right to freedom of expression as provided in article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or rights of others the government contested that argument a admissibility the court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissionsa the applicant the applicant claimed that the interference with his right to freedom of expression even though it had been in accordance with law and had pursued a legitimate aim had not been proportionate the applicant maintained that the domestic courts had failed to conduct a proper balancing exercise between the competing interests since they had not taken into account all of the relevant criteria established in the courts caselaw he referred to axel springer ag v germany gc no february first of all his allegations contributed to a debate of general interest as they related to the manner in which the banks which was partly owned by the state funds had been spent they also related to a political party which had obtained of the seats in parliament his allegations had not been directed against al as a private individual nor had he disclosed any details of als personal life secondly his allegations about possible misappropriation of the banks funds were made on the basis on the applicants initial report which relied inter alia on the information provided by the marketing and economics departments referring to novaya gazeta v voronezhe v russia no december he argued that the information that he had provided to the journalists had constituted a value judgment since he had explicitly told the journalists that this information still needed to be verified by the banks internal audit the fact that the respective information had later proved incorrect should not have affected this conclusion moreover the applicant had had a sufficient factual basis for this information namely his report on krājbankas advertising and marketing expenses he believed that there had been solid grounds for his allegations he considered that he had acted in good faith he admitted that his statements might have been considered provocative but they had not overstepped the permissible degree of criticism as the chairman of the supervisory board he had acted in the interests of the banks shareholders including the state and was under a duty to inform the public about the supervisory boards activities which would not have been the case had the matter concerned a private entity furthermore the applicant could not be held responsible for the manner in which the journalists had decided to report the information provided by him thirdly the applicant noted that the press had reported on als professional activities on a regular basis the applicant then cited further statements which had been reported in the other articles published by nra see paragraph above but which had not been made by him he emphasised that those statements had not been found defamatory as they had either contained sufficient factual basis or had been considered as value judgments it was his view that those publications showed that als activities had been controversial and that criticism had been directed at various activities related to his professional conduct fourthly it had to be taken into account that the published articles had not caused any obstacles for al to be elected as a member of parliament and later to hold the position as the chairman of saeimas defence and home affairs commission although the applicants allegations and criticism regarding als professional activities might have been unpleasant they had not harmed als reputation lastly the applicant submitted that the appellate court while awarding damages in the amount of lvl had failed to specify any grounds for its decision to award this specific sum they had merely referred to the applicants position and had noted that this amount corresponds to the seriousness of the delict such reasoning was in his view insufficient the applicant considered that he had been imposed with a severe sanction taking into account the economic situation in the country average net monthly salary at the material time had stood at eur lvl therefore the award had amounted to average monthly salaries he also referred to the socalled talsi tragedy cases where the nonpecuniary damage awards in connection with an incident of june where several children had lost their lives had been lvl see for more information elberte v latvia no echr b the government the government acknowledged that the impugned court decisions had amounted to an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression however the interference had been prescribed by law and had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation of al as guaranteed by article of the convention referring to kasabova v bulgaria no april and axel springer ag cited above the government also claimed that the interference had been proportionate they maintained that the states must be given a certain margin of appreciation in striking the appropriate balance between the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life kasabova cited above first of all the government did not agree that the applicants allegations had contributed to a debate of public interest they agreed that the public had an interest in being informed about any criminal proceedings but emphasised that it had to be done observing the principle of presumption of innocence the applicant did not observe this principle as had provided the journalists with false and defamatory information similarly the public had the right to know about the use the funds partly owned by the state however the applicants conduct had created an adverse effect as he had mislead society with false information and injured the reputation of al secondly they argued that the information provided by the applicant had not constituted a value judgment but had been a statement of fact as established by the domestic courts the government noted that the domestic courts when examining als claims concerning all thirtyone articles published by nra see paragraphs et seq above had made a clear distinction between the comments made by the applicant and the opinions expressed by the journalists furthermore the applicant himself had admitted that the information provided by him to the journalists had been incorrect alternatively even if the information provided by the applicant had constituted a value judgment the government claimed that it had lacked a sufficient factual basis the government emphasised that the nine articles in issue had been published between and october whereas already on october the supervisory board had received the first results of the internal audit dismissing the applicants allegations nor did the final report of october confirm the applicants allegations given the applicants professional qualification and previous experience he must have been aware that his allegations of the misappropriation of funds including the statement this is money that has been stolen from the shareholders which could amount to such criminal offences as fraud misappropriation of funds or abuse of official authority could only be substantiated by confirmed results of internal or external audits even assuming that the applicant indeed believed that there had been solid grounds for his allegations he did not retract those allegations as soon as he learned that they had not been confirmed by the internal audit either on or october nor did he retract them after receiving the results of an external audit in may the government concluded that the applicants allegations fell outside the limits of acceptable criticism and that he had not acted in good faith thirdly the government did not dispute that during his time in office as the president of the bank and throughout the preelection period al had acted in a public context they added however that he had not previously been held criminally liable for his professional or private activities also the applicants prior conduct had to be addressed they emphasised his professional qualification and previous experience and noted that he had to be aware of the fact that his allegations could only be disclosed if he had credible information fourthly the government reiterated that the domestic courts had found the applicant liable for nine false and defamatory publications which in essence had been related to the same issue as stated by the government lvl was transferred without documentation apparently for krājbankas advertising and marketing activities of which lvl went to the advertising agency z which also happened to be responsible for creating latvias first partys preelection campaign lastly as regards the amount of compensation the domestic courts had taken note of similar cases examined by the court taking into account the applicants status the award was not capable of having a chilling effect on the applicant the courts assessmenta existence of an interference lawfulness and legitimate aim it is common ground between the parties that the award of damages against the applicant amounted to an interference with his right to freedom of expression and that it was prescribed by law the parties also agreed that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the rights of others namely the reputation of al what remains to be established is whether the interference was necessary in a democratic societyb necessary in a democratic societyi general principles the court has already had occasion to lay down the relevant principles which must guide its assessment and more importantly that of domestic courts of necessity it has thus identified a number of criteria within the context of balancing the competing rights the relevant criteria have thus far been defined as the contribution to a debate of public interest the degree of notoriety of the person affected the subject of the news report the prior conduct of the person affected and the content form and consequences of the publication where it examines an application lodged under article the court will also examine the way in which the information was obtained and its veracity as well as the severity of the sanction imposed see for recent authorities medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no and echr with further references and ärztekammer für wien and dorner v austria no february furthermore the court draws a distinction between statements of fact and value judgments the existence of facts can be demonstrated whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article however where a statement amounts to a value judgment the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement if there is not that value judgment may prove excessive in order to distinguish between a factual allegation and a value judgment it is necessary to take account of the circumstances of the case and the general tone of the remarks bearing in mind that assertions about matters of public interest may on that basis constitute value judgments rather than statements of fact see morice v france gc no echr with further references the court also emphasises that free elections and freedom of expression particularly freedom of political debate together form the bedrock of any democratic system the two rights are interrelated and operate to reinforce each other for that reason it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds are permitted to circulate freely see for a recent authority cheltsova v russia no june with further references however article does not guarantee wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern and relating to politicians or public officials see among other authorities bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii it is open to the relevant state authorities to adopt appropriate measures in order to react without excess to defamatory accusations that are devoid of foundation or formulated in bad faith moreover freedom of expression carries with it duties and responsibilities and any person who chooses to disclose information must carefully verify to the extent permitted by the circumstances in question that it is accurate and reliable see guja v moldova gc no echr furthermore the more serious the allegation the higher the level of diligence that must be exercised before bringing it to the attention of the relevant authorities or the public see medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above when the freedom of expression of persons with public responsibilities is at stake the duties and responsibilities referred to in article are of particular importance in that regard an important aspect is the privileged position that persons with public responsibilities enjoy in accessing the media owing to their position of authority see poyraz v turkey no december ii application of the relevant general principles to the present case the present case concerns defamation proceedings against the applicant who was in office as the chairman of the supervisory board of the bank which was partly owned by the state he provided comments to the journalists regarding allegations of undocumented advertising and marketing expenses that he had raised at the banks supervisory board meeting as a result during the month which preceded the parliamentary elections nra published numerous articles about the upcoming elections including nine articles referring to the applicants allegations which later turned out to be unfounded the court can accept that the applicants allegations were made in the context of a public debate prior to the parliamentary elections and concerned al who was one of the leaders of a newly established political party and who stood for election also it was undisputed in the domestic proceedings and before the court that al during his time in office as the president of the bank and throughout the preelection period had acted in a public context while the domestic courts did not provide full analysis of the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw see paragraph above the court does not consider it necessary to examine this further because the crux of the present case is the question of whether the applicants allegations contained a factual basis that was sufficient in view of the particular circumstances of the present case the court notes that the parties to the present case disagreed as to whether the applicants allegations of undocumented advertising and marketing expenses in the bank constituted statements of fact or value judgments the domestic courts reasoning in this respect was rather succinct as they limited themselves to finding that the applicants allegations turned out to be unfounded which fact the applicant did not contest and had thus been false from the very beginning while the court considers that some of the applicants assertions could be regarded as constituting value judgements his pronouncements also included statements of fact susceptible of proof in any event the court is of the view that the issue that must be determined in the present case is whether there was at least a sufficient factual basis for the applicants allegations the reasonableness of the efforts made to verify the accuracy of the information disclosed must be determined in the light of the situation at the time that the statements were made rather than with the benefit of hindsight on the basis of the subsequent internal and external audit reports see mutatis mutandis medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above the court also refers here to the duties and responsibilities associated with freedom of expression see paragraph above and notes their pertinence to the present case given the applicants public status under the domestic law as the chairman of the supervisory board of the partly stateowned bank as well as his own affirmation that he had the duty to inform the public of the supervisory boards activities it is undisputed that the applicants allegations were based on his initial report that he had prepared for the purposes of the supervisory boards meeting see paragraph above he had requested and received internal information from the marketing and economics departments in this regard and informed the supervisory board about his personal findings of undocumented advertising and marketing expenses in the bank he also commented on his allegations to the journalists who on the day after the supervisory boards extraordinary meeting published the first article alleging that under the banks previous management large sums of money had been transferred without any documentation in order to finance advertising and marketing activities the applicant was directly quoted as stating that somebody is receiving this paid money back and this is money that has been stolen from the shareholders in later newspaper articles the applicant was also quoted as saying it is possible that this is the money that provided the foundation for the latvias first partys sizable advertising campaign these statements made by the applicant see also paragraph above contained serious allegations the senate of the supreme court relying on the journalists testimony held that the applicants allegations had specifically concerned al and not as claimed by the applicant the banks management as a whole what is in issue in the present case is whether the applicant exceeded the limits of acceptable criticism by commenting on his allegations to the journalists at the material time the court agrees with the domestic courts that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider for politicians than in relation to private individuals moreover candidates in parliamentary elections are exposed to the widest scrutiny by the press and by the public that being said in view of the consequences that serious allegations of misconduct may have on public opinion and potentially on the results of elections duties and responsibilities inherent in freedom of expression require particularly close scrutiny as to whether there was a sufficient factual basis for such serious allegations the applicants initial report not having been made available the court notes several factors which call into question the way in which the applicant acted when commenting on his allegations to the journalists in the present case given his position his knowledge of the relevant events and the point in time at which he made his allegations first of all the applicant must have been aware of his status under domestic law as a public official and that the journalists could in accordance with section of the law on the mass media rely on his statements see paragraphs and above the domestic courts established that the journalists had had no reason to doubt the credibility of the information provided by the applicant owing to his position as the chairman of the supervisory board indeed the journalists could not further verify the applicants allegations given that they concerned the banks internal documents and did not appear to have been publicly available compare bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above secondly the court notes that the applicant formed his views concerning undocumented advertising and marketing expenses after consulting the heads of the marketing and economics departments it is unclear given the seriousness of the allegations why he did not solicit any relevant information from the internal audit department before giving his comments to the press the court notes that it took only around fourteen days for the internal audit department to carry out its preliminary verification of the applicants allegations and to dismiss them nonetheless the applicant commented on his allegations to the press without awaiting the outcome of the internal audit which was still ongoing when he made those comments thus the applicant knowingly chose to disclose unverified information to the journalists thirdly the applicants comments were made during the month preceding the elections at the time when a political debate was at its peak such allegations were capable of carrying a certain weight on public opinion about the newly established party and one of its leaders given the applicants position at the bank and the nature of his allegations the court does not consider that the applicant could rely on the degree of exaggeration or even provocation that can usually be used in the exercise of freedom of expression in the context of a political debate see mutatis mutandis petrina v romania no october compare also standard verlagsgesellschaft mb h v austria no no february therefore given the circumstances of the case the need for a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis was particularly relevant lastly it appears that the applicant took no steps to voice his disagreement a press release official comment or retraction etc with the publication of further articles citing him as a source and providing further quotes of his statements when as early as october the first results of the internal audit were made available to the supervisory board finding no proof for undocumented advertising and marketing expenses in the bank as noted by the government he appears not to have taken any further steps to remedy the situation after the final results had been made available by the internal audit and external audit in view of the foregoing the court concludes that the applicants initial report on the basis of which he made comments on such serious allegations as misappropriation of the banks funds by its former president who was a candidate in the parliamentary elections contained no sufficient factual basis even if the applicants comments were to be regarded as constituting value judgments the applicant accordingly overstepped the limits of acceptable criticism in relation to al the court is therefore satisfied that the disputed interference was supported by relevant and sufficient reasons and that the authorities of the respondent state struck a fair balance between the applicants freedom of expression on the one hand and als interest in protection of his reputation on the other hand thus acting within their margin of appreciation compare poyraz cited above accordingly there has been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the complaint under article of the convention admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on june pursuant to rule and of the rules of court claudia westerdiek angelika nußberger registrar president,,,
29,the applicant was born in and lives in paris a background to the case on october mr bernard borrel a judge who at the time had been seconded as technical adviser to the djiboutian minister of justice was found dead kilometres from the city of djibouti his halfnaked and partially burnt body was lying some metres below a remote road in early november the investigation by the local gendarmerie concluded that he had committed suicide by selfimmolation in november a judicial investigation was opened in toulouse to establish the cause of the judges death his body on its repatriation to france was interred in toulouse in february an autopsy was carried out on the judges remains and its conclusion notified to his widow was that he had committed suicide after dowsing himself in petrol in february mrs elisabeth borrel the widow of bernard borrel disputing that finding filed a complaint as a civil party against a person or persons unknown for premeditated murder in april a judicial investigation was opened in july a private forensic report commissioned by the civil party concluded that in view of the total absence of burn residue in the judges lungs he must already have been dead when his body caught fire the judicial investigation was subsequently transferred to paris where the case was assigned in late october to ms m assisted by mr ll both investigating judges at the paris tribunal de grande instance in march the investigating judges visited djibouti without the civil parties while mrs borrel was challenging the suicide conclusion a witness a former member of the djiboutian presidential guard who had found asylum in belgium came forward in december and lent support to the theory of premeditated murder implicating the former chief of staff of the president of djibouti his testimony proved highly controversial and was widely reported in the press and other media in january the investigating judge ms m interviewed the witness in brussels after which he challenged her impartiality alleging that she had put pressure on him to withdraw his testimony in the context of the judicial investigation in respect of the premeditated murder charge three professional unions including the union syndicale des magistrats the usm applied on february to be joined to the case as civil parties lastly in early march the investigating judges accompanied by the director of the paris institute of forensic medicine and the deputy public prosecutor of paris paid another visit to djibouti in order to stage a reenactment at the scene without the civil parties being present they had asked to participate but their visa applications had been turned down on june the case was withdrawn from the two investigating judges by the paris court of appeal as it regarded as unjustified their refusal to order a new visit to djibouti with the participation of the civil parties the case was transferred to another investigating judge mr pb criminal proceedings against the applicant the applicant is mrs borrels lawyer on july a general meeting of the judges of the paris tribunal de grande instance held in paris examined among other things the situation of the judge ms m it had been announced in the press that the minister of justice had referred to the conseil supérieur de la magistrature national legal service council a dossier concerning the church of scientology which she had been working on as investigating judge and in which certain shortcomings had been noted during that meeting a judge mr jm stated as follows we are not prohibited as grassroots judges from saying that we are friends of ms m it is not forbidden to say that ms m has our support and trust on september the applicant and a fellow lawyer wrote a letter to the minister of justice in connection with the judicial investigation into judge borrels death they stated that they were complaining again to the minister of justice about the conduct of judges m and ll which was completely at odds with the principles of impartiality and fairness they asked for an investigation to be carried out by the general inspectorate of judicial services into the numerous shortcomings which had been brought to light in the course of the judicial investigation they added that after the case had been withdrawn from investigating judges m and ll by a judgment of the indictments division of the paris court of appeal dated june all of the evidence had been transmitted to the new judge on june noting that a video recording made during an onsite visit by the investigating judges unaccompanied by the civil parties was not in the file thus transmitted the lawyers protested about this to the new judge on august they pointed out that the new judge had received that evidence on the same day and in their view this showed that judges m and ll had been sitting on this videocassette also forgetting to place it under seal for over a month after the case was withdrawn from them they further stated that the judge on opening the cassettes cover had discovered an envelope containing a letter addressed to judge m about which they commented that its content was revealing and the literary quality of this letter was such that it obliged them to reproduce it for the minister of justice in full especially as it came from the public prosecutor of the republic of djibouti mr ds the letter read as follows salut marie paule je tenvoie comme convenu la cassette vidéo du transport au goubet jespère que limage sera satisfaisante jai regardé lémission sans aucun doute sur tfjai pu constater à nouveau combien madame borrel et ses avocats sont décidés à continuer leur entreprise de manipulation je tappellerai bientôt passe le bonjour à roger sil est rentré de même quà jcdje tembrasse djama hi marie paule as agreed i am sending you the videocassette of the goubet site visit i hope the picture will be clear enough i watched the show without any doubt on tfi noticed once again how mrs borrel and her lawyers were determined to carry on their manipulation ill call you soon say hello to roger if hes back and also to jcdbest wishes djama the lawyers continued their letter as follows the form and substance of the letter reveal moreover a surprising and regrettable complicit intimacy between the french judges and the djibouti public prosecutor a judicial authority placed directly under the government of which the head is very openly and very seriously suspected of being the instigator of bernard borrels murder this type of information is clearly capable of explaining the firm and constant determination of the investigating judges to stop the civil parties and their lawyers from attending the reenactments held in djibouti as you are aware this particularly delicate case concerns the death of a french judge and his widow herself a judge can not accept such conduct on the part of other judges in disregard of the most basic rules not only those of the procedure but also those requiring respect for the victims in those circumstances we are obliged to bring this matter to your attention to seek your assurance that all the shortcomings will be fully scrutinised the newspaper le monde published an article dated september entitled borrel case judge ms impartiality called into question the journalist reported in the article that mrs borrels lawyers had vigorously criticised judge m to the minister of justice it was stated that the applicant and his colleague had accused the judge of conduct which was completely at odds with the principles of impartiality and fairness and that the judge seemed to have omitted to register an item from the case file and to transmit it to her successor the article further stated judges m and ll had been sitting on this videocassette protests the lawyer olivier morice and also forgot to place it under seal for over a month after the case was withdrawn from them the article continued as follows to make matters worse in the envelope judge p found a handwritten and rather friendly note by ds the public prosecutor of djibouti the wording of the note found inside the cassettes cover was then reproduced in the article which added mrs borrels lawyers are obviously furious this letter shows the extent of the connivance which exists between the djibouti public prosecutor and the french judges exclaims mr morice and one can not but find it outrageous it was then stated that the lawyers had asked the minister of justice to initiate an investigation by the general inspectorate of judicial services on and october the two judges in question lodged a criminal complaint for public defamation of a civil servant against the editorinchief of le monde the journalist who had written the article and the applicant applying to join the proceedings as civil parties the defendants were committed to stand trial before the nanterre tribunal de grande instance by an order of the investigating judge dated october the complaint concerned the following passages of the article published on september she judge m is accused by lawyers olivier morice and ld of conduct which is completely at odds with the principles of impartiality and fairness and seems to have omitted to register an item from the case file and to transmit it to her successor judges m and ll had been sitting on this cassette protests olivier morice and also forgot to place it under seal for over a month after the case was withdrawn from them to make matters worse in the envelope judge p found a handwritten and rather friendly note mrs borrels lawyers are obviously furious this letter shows the extent of the connivance which exists between the djibouti public prosecutor and the french judges exclaims mr morice and one can not but find it outrageous the court hearing took place on april and the judgment was delivered on june the applicant first invoked the immunity provided for under section of the freedom of the press act of july the court rejected that argument finding that the action taken by the applicant and his colleague in writing to the minister of justice could not be regarded as connected to judicial proceedings or documents adduced before a court of law within the meaning of section of that act the court then examined whether the comments at issue were defamatory it noted at the outset that this had not been meaningfully disputed and that the applicant stood by the content of his allegations that he considered well founded concerning the first passage the court noted that the quotation was correct the letter to the minister having been included in the case file it added that the accusation of impartiality sic and unfairness proffered against a judge clearly constituted a particularly defamatory allegation because it was tantamount to calling into question her qualities her moral and professional rigour and ultimately her capacity to discharge her duties as a judge as regards the cassette it noted that the comments reflected at least some negligence in the handling of the judicial investigation and also cast doubt on the professional integrity of the two investigating judges it added that read as a whole the comments suggested that the cassette had only been included in the proceedings because it had been demanded by the lawyers then by the judge himself and that it had been necessary as it were to thwart and denounce a sort of obstruction on the part of judges m and ll it took the view that such assertions had to be classified as defamatory as they necessarily impugned a persons honour and reputation within the meaning of section of the freedom of the press act as regards the last of the impugned passages the court noted that the defamatory weight of the term connivance was the only aspect to have given rise to debate it noted that this term followed a number of other defamatory passages of which the highly negative wording and one can not but find it outrageous proved the deliberately strong connotation of the word connivance according to the court the use of that word clearly and directly suggested that on account of their good relations with the djibouti public prosecutor judges m and ll had been collaborating with that official of a foreign country in investigating the case in a partial and unfair manner in breach of the basic principles of law and of judicial office the court found that the defamatory nature of those views was exacerbated by the subsequent indication in the article that the lawyers had asked the minister of justice to initiate an investigation by the general inspectorate of judicial services thus implying that they had a serious basis on which to substantiate such an accusation as to the applicants guilt the court noted that the law of july provided that a person supplying defamatory information to a journalist in the knowledge that it would be published could be convicted for instigation of public defamation the court noted that in the present case the applicant had confirmed at the hearing that he had spoken on the telephone with the journalist who had drafted the article and had made the comments as reported the court concluded that it was established that the applicant had supplied information to a journalist of the daily newspaper le monde for the purposes of publication making comments of which the defamatory nature was patent as to the applicants offer to bring evidence the court pointed out that in order to be admitted the evidence had to be perfect and complete and to relate directly to all the accusations found to be defamatory as regards the shortcomings in the judicial investigation the court noted that it was still in progress and that the judgment of june had expressed disapproval with the refusal by the judges concerned to proceed with the reenactment requested by the civil party and had acted thereon by ordering the case to be withdrawn from them it took the view however that it could not be inferred that all the criticisms made in open court about the handling of the judicial investigation should be regarded as founded as regards the retention of the cassette the court noted that no offer of evidence had been seriously made in order to establish any professional misconduct or dishonest conduct on the part of the investigating judges lastly as to the term connivance the court stressed that a possible convergence of opinion between participants in the judicial process without its precise extent having been determined did not in any way prove the existence of a culpable complicity with the aim of distorting the investigation procedure it concluded that the applicant had failed in all his offers to bring evidence in support of his good faith the applicant referred to the duties that were inherent in his mission of defending clients and the results obtained in response to the requests of the civil party since the withdrawal of the case from judges m and ll the court refused however to admit his defence of good faith finding that the highly virulent attacks on the professional and moral integrity of the investigating judges clearly overstepped the right of legitimately admissible free criticism the court thus found mr morice guilty of instigating the public defamation of judges m and ll it sentenced him to a fine of euros eur and ordered him to pay jointly with the journalist and publication director of le monde eur to each of the two judges the court further ordered that an announcement be published in the newspaper le monde at their shared expense all the parties to the proceedings appealed against that judgment the versailles court of appeal delivered its judgment on may it held that judge lls appeal was timebarred and upheld the three convictions for defamation against judge m it increased the amount of the fines imposed on the applicants codefendants from to euros and to euros respectively however it confirmed the amount of the fine imposed on the applicant and that of the damages awarded and also the order to have an announcement published in le monde in a judgment of october on appeals by the applicant and judge ll the court of cassation finding that the reasoning was inconsistent and that judge lls appeal was not timebarred quashed the court of appeals judgment in its entirety it remitted the case to the rouen court of appeal which thus had to rule on the criminal and civilparty actions against the three defendants in relation to judge ll and on the criminal and civil actions against the applicant alone in relation to judge m after a number of adjournments the hearing before the rouen court of appeal was held on april in its judgment of july that court looked again at the defamatory nature of the impugned comments as regards the conduct of judge m the court found that to say about an investigating judge that in the handling of a case she had shown conduct which was completely at odds with the principles of impartiality and fairness or in other words conduct incompatible with professional ethics and her judicial oath was a particularly defamatory accusation because it was tantamount to accusing her of lacking integrity and of deliberately failing in her duties as a judge thus questioning her capacity to discharge those duties as to the delay in the transmission of the cassette the court noted that the applicants comments not only accused the judges of negligence in the handling of the case thereby discrediting the professional competence of the judges but above all implied that the latter had kept hold of the cassette after the case was withdrawn from them with the intention at least of causing obstruction allegedly it was only because the lawyers had raised the matter with p followed by that judges request to judge m that the item of evidence had been obtained and finally transmitted on august the court of appeal added that such assertions attributing to those judges a deliberate failure to perform the duties inherent in their office and a lack of integrity in the fulfilment of their obligations constituted factual accusations which impugned their honour and reputation it found this to be all the more true as the applicant referring to the handwritten note from the public prosecutor of djibouti had emphasised this atmosphere of suspicion and the negligent conduct of the judges by stating that this document proved the extent of the connivance between them and the prosecutor the court noted on that point that the word thus used implied that on account of those good relations judge m had been able to conceal the truth and conduct her investigation in a partial and unfair manner in breach of professional ethics and the fundamental principles governing the office of judge the court added that such an allegation accusing the two judges of a total breach of the duties inherent in their office represented in itself a serious attack on their honour and reputation it merely served to confirm the defamatory nature of the previous comments especially as the article added that the applicant had asked the minister of justice for an inspection by the general inspectorate of judicial services the court of appeal concluded that the offending passages characterised the offence of public defamation against civil servants as to the applicants offer to bring evidence the court of appeal referring in part to the arguments of the court below took the view that none of the items produced showed on the part of the judges any unfair or partial conduct any failure to perform the duties inherent in their office or any lack of integrity in the handling of the case concerning the death of judge borrel it concluded that the veracity of the defamatory allegations had not been established as regards the applicants defence of good faith the court noted that he had referred to the duties that were inherent in his mission of defending clients the results obtained in the case since the change of investigating judge and the judicial decisions taken thereafter it found however that at the time of the articles publication the highly virulent attacks on the professional and moral integrity of the two judges in comments that seriously questioned their impartiality and intellectual honesty clearly overstepping the right to free criticism was no longer of any procedural interest because the case had already been withdrawn from them the court found that the particularly defamatory comments made by the applicant in the press against the two judges revealed by their excessive nature the intensity of the conflict between him and in particular judge m it considered the comments to amount to an ex post facto settling of scores as shown by their inclusion as the applicant had wished in an article published in le monde on september according to the court on that date the applicant could not have been unaware that the investigation division of the paris court of appeal had just begun to examine at his request as lawyer acting for the civil parties the case of the church of scientology in which m as investigating judge in the case was suspected of being responsible for the disappearance of documents it concluded that this showed on the part of the applicant personal animosity and an intention to discredit those judges in particular judge m with whom he had been in conflict in various cases thus ruling out his good faith consequently the court of appeal upheld the judgment of the court below found the applicant guilty of instigating the offence of defamation against a civil servant sentenced him to a fine of eur and jointly with his two codefendants awarded eur in damages to each of the civil parties it also ordered the publication of an announcement in le monde the defendants and judge m lodged an appeal on points of law against that judgment the applicant relied in particular on article of the convention arguing that the immunity provided for in section of the freedom of the press act protected the lawyer in respect of any oral or written comments made in the context of any type of judicial proceedings in particular of a disciplinary nature it followed in his submission that the letter of september to the minister of justice for the purpose of asking the national legal service council conseil supérieur de la magistrature to take action against two judges who had been responsible for investigating the case in question fell within the context of the defence of the civil partys interests accordingly in his view the court of appeal had not been entitled to refuse to grant immunity from suit in respect of the allegedly defamatory comments contained in that letter on the ground that it did not constitute an act of referral that could be covered by the term pleadings in section of the abovementioned act on that point the court of cassation found that the court of appeal had justified its decision by taking the view that the fact of making public the letter to the minister of justice seeking an investigation by the general inspectorate of judicial services into the shortcomings attributed to the two investigating judges did not constitute an act of referral to the national legal service council and was not part of any proceedings involving the exercise of defence rights before a court of law the applicant further relied on article of the convention asserting that the impugned comments concerned a court case that had for a long time received media coverage and the questionable manner in which the investigation had been conducted having regard to the importance of the subject of general interest in the context of which the comments had been made the court of appeal was not entitled to find that he had overstepped the bounds of his freedom of expression he contended that good faith was to be assessed in the light of the impugned comments that had been published he added that the mere fact that he had had a disagreement with one of the judges in the context of another set of proceedings did not prove that he was driven by any personal animosity lastly he argued that opinions expressed about the functioning of a basic institution of the state like the handling of a criminal investigation were not subject to a duty of prudence in the expression of thought the court of cassation took the view that the court of appeal had justified its decision while everyone had the right to freedom of expression and while the public had a legitimate interest in receiving information on criminal proceedings and the functioning of the courts the exercise of those freedoms entailed duties and responsibilities and could be subject as in the present case where the admissible limits of freedom of expression in criticising the action of judges had been overstepped to restrictions or sanctions prescribed by law which constituted measures that were necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation and rights of others it dismissed the appeals by a judgment of november the bench which gave that judgment included in particular mr jm see paragraph above ii relevant domestic law the relevant provisions of the freedom of the press act of july read as follows section the making of any factual allegation or imputation that damages the honour or reputation of the person or body to whom the fact in question is attributed shall

may be based on any of the following groundso where there has been between the judge and one of the parties any manifestation serious enough to cast doubt on hisher impartiality article an application for the withdrawal of a member of the court of cassation hearing a criminal case must give reasons it shall be deposited in the registry the assistance of a lawyer is not compulsory article the competent section shall rule within one month from the filing of the application with the registry after receiving the observations of the judge whose withdrawal is sought the procedure shall otherwise be governed by the provisions of book ii title xx of the code of civil procedure the code of civil procedure provides as follows article the judge as soon as he or she receives the copy of the application must stand down until the ruling on the requested withdrawal in case of urgency another judge may be appointed even ex parte to perform the necessary acts article a request for the withdrawal of a member of the court of cassation shall be examined by a section other than that to which the case has been allocated designated by the president of the court the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant alleged that there had been a violation of article of the convention and submitted that his case had not been heard fairly in an impartial tribunal as regards the proceedings before the court of cassation he complained that mr jm who was on the bench which ruled on his appeal had previously expressed his support publicly for judge m at the general meeting of judges of the paris tribunal de grande instance on july the relevant part of article reads as follows in the determination of any criminal charge against him everyone is entitled to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law a admissibility the government argued that the applicant had not exhausted internal remedies within the meaning of article of the convention they submitted that the applicant could have requested the withdrawal of mr jm on the grounds of his lack of impartiality they referred to articles and of the code of criminal procedure and explained that the procedure for requesting a judges withdrawal was straightforward as the relevant application giving reasons had to be filed in the registry of the court of cassation by the requesting party or lawyer the government added that it was an appropriate remedy since in accordance with the code of civil procedure the application for withdrawal had suspensive effect as soon as he became aware of the request the judge had to stand down until the ruling on his withdrawal they denied that the applicant had not discovered until reading the judgment that mr jm had been sitting in the case they explained that the proceedings were held before a bench of which the members had been designated by the president of the court and that the applicant must have or could have known who they were they appended to their observations the order of the president of the court of cassation dated january stipulating inter alia that mr jm would sit in the criminal division from february onwards they added that since september lawyers at the conseil détat and court of cassation were immediately informed in writing when a case was referred to a full section rather than a reduced bench of the development in the proceedings moreover a few weeks before the hearing the lawyers were informed by a notice from the prosecutors officer of the date when their case was to be heard and they were entitled to present oral argument should they deem it necessary they produced a copy of the online workflow for the applicants appeal summarising the various stages of the court of cassation proceedings together with the report by the reporting judge both referring to examination by a reduced bench they submitted that the applicant had thus had the necessary time to file a request for withdrawal the government lastly pointed out that the lawyer at the conseil détat and court of cassation could not have failed to notice the presence of mr jm at the hearing when he had made his oral submissions it would still have been possible at that stage to lodge an application for the judges withdrawal but he had not done so accordingly in the governments submission a party which had not sought a judges withdrawal before the close of the proceedings when it could have done so was presumed to have unequivocally waived that right the government referred on this point to the courts caselaw and emphasised that the court had already found the application for withdrawal to be an effective remedy the applicant submitted that in the present case neither he nor his lawyer had been able to know that mr jm would be sitting he pointed out that the documents adduced by the government showed on the contrary that mr jm was not supposed to sit in that hearing first the judges report filed on july stated that a draft had been drawn up and examination by a reduced bench proposed secondly the online workflow for the applicants case indicated next to the date of october hearing section reduced bench procedure the applicant explained that the reduced bench was a bench of three judges from the section concerned the president of the division the doyen senior member and the reporting judge as mr jm was none of those the applicant could not have expected him to sit in his case ultimately it was a larger full section bench made up of ten judges including mr jm which heard the applicants appeal without his lawyer having been informed he argued that he had thus been misled about the real composition of the court of cassation and had thus been deprived of the right to seek the withdrawal of a judge the applicant also produced three notices to lawyers from the registry of the criminal division of the court of cassation dated september and and october respectively in which it was indicated that the case would be or had been examined by a reduced bench on october he observed that the proceedings before the court of cassation were written and that his lawyer had not been obliged to attend the hearing of october he concluded that he had not had any reason to call for the withdrawal of a judge who was not supposed to be a member of the bench hearing his appeal he added that it was the final judgment of november which had revealed to him the precise composition of the division at the time of its deliberation the court reiterates that the purpose of article is to afford the contracting states the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the convention institutions see for example remli v france april reports of judgments and decisions ii and selmouni v france gc no echr v as regards an allegation to the effect that a court has not satisfied the conditions of independence or impartiality required by article of the convention the possibility of lodging an application for withdrawal under french law can be regarded as an effective remedy for the purposes of article of the convention and where the impartiality of a given member of a court is in issue the withdrawal procedure must be implemented see huglo lepage et associés scp v france dec no march and roussin v france dec no october the court notes that in the present case it can be seen from the documents submitted both by the applicant and by the government that the case was supposed to be examined by a reduced bench of section i of the criminal division of the court of cassation the report of the reporting judge dated july the court of cassations online workflow for the case and the three notices issued on september and and october respectively thus all mention that the case was being heard by a reduced bench even in the last two of those documents which were sent after the date of the hearing consequently mr jm who was neither the division president nor the doyen nor the reporting judge was not supposed to sit in this case and the applicant had no reason to believe that he would as regards moreover the possibility of raising this point at the hearing the court notes that the proceedings before the court of cassation are mainly written and that there is no evidence in the file to show that the applicants lawyer had been present at the hearing in those circumstances the court takes the view that the applicant had no reason to request the withdrawal of mr jm and had thus been unable to use the remedy advocated by the government the objection raised by the government must thus be rejected moreover the court finds that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions on the merits the applicant took the view that the government had sought in vain to minimise the position taken by mr jm at the general meeting of the paris tribunal de grande instance of july he indicated that those comments although they had been made in the context of disciplinary proceedings against judge m in the case concerning the church of scientology revealed that mr jms relations with her were close and supportive as expressed in a broad manner and not being confined to the scientology case see paragraph above he added that the rouen court of appeal had used that case against him the applicant further observed that he had also been the lawyer acting for certain civil parties in the scientology case and had triggered the disciplinary proceedings against judge m because he had referred to the minister of justice the difficulties he had encountered with her in that case see paragraph above the government for their part emphasised that mr jm had made the comments at issue almost ten years earlier when he had been a judge at the paris tribunal de grande instance they added that those comments had been made in a different court and context that of a case concerning the church of scientology and could not be regarded as a general and unconditional expression of support for judge m the courts assessmenta general principles the principles emanating from the caselaw on such matters were summarised by the court as follows in the case of micallef v malta gc no echr impartiality normally denotes the absence of prejudice or bias and its existence or otherwise can be tested in various ways according to the courts constant caselaw the existence of impartiality for the purposes of article must be determined according to a subjective test where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge that is whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case and also according to an objective test that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself and among other aspects its composition offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality see inter alia fey v austria february and series a no a and wettstein v switzerland no echr xii as to the subjective test the principle that a tribunal shall be presumed to be free of personal prejudice or partiality is longestablished in the caselaw of the court see for example kyprianou v cyprus gc no echr xiii the court has held that the personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary see wettstein cited above as regards the type of proof required the court has for example sought to ascertain whether a judge has displayed hostility or ill will for personal reasons see de cubber v belgium october series a no in the vast majority of cases raising impartiality issues the court has focused on the objective test however there is no watertight division between subjective and objective impartiality since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer objective test but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction subjective test see kyprianou cited above thus in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judges subjective impartiality the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee see pullar v the united kingdom june reports iii as to the objective test it must be determined whether quite apart from the judges conduct there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his impartiality this implies that in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or a body sitting as a bench lacks impartiality the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive what is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified see wettstein cited above and ferrantelli and santangelo v italy august reports iii the objective test mostly concerns hierarchical or other links between the judge and other actors in the proceedings see court martial cases for example miller and others v the united kingdom nos and october see also cases regarding the dual role of a judge for example mežnarić v croatia no july and wettstein cited above where the lawyer representing the applicants opponents subsequently judged the applicant in a single set of proceedings and overlapping proceedings respectively which objectively justify misgivings as to the impartiality of the tribunal and thus fail to meet the convention standard under the objective test see kyprianou cited above it must therefore be decided in each individual case whether the relationship in question is of such a nature and degree as to indicate a lack of impartiality on the part of the tribunal see pullar cited above in this respect even appearances may be of a certain importance or in other words justice must not only be done it must also be seen to be done see de cubber cited above what is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public thus any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw see castillo algar v spain october reports viiib application of those principles to the present case the court notes that in the present case the applicant called into question the impartiality of judge jm it is established that at the general meeting of the judges of the paris tribunal de grande instance on july jm made the following statement about judge m after shortcomings had been observed in her handling of the investigation into a case concerning the church of scientology we are not prohibited as grassroots judges from saying that we are friends of ms m it is not forbidden to say that ms m has our support and trust it further notes that the applicant was precisely the lawyer acting for certain civil parties in the scientology case and that he himself at the time had complained to the minister of justice about the difficulties he had encountered with judge m in the course of the judicial investigation in the proceedings at issue in the present case judge m had filed a complaint as a civil party in particular against the applicant who had made statements about how the investigation was being handled in the case concerning judge borrel the court does not find any evidence in the file to show that in the present case judge jm displayed any personal bias it will thus examine the case in terms of objective impartiality it observes that judge jm sat on the bench of the criminal division of the court of cassation which ruled on appeals by judge m and the applicant stemming from a dispute between them and which dismissed those appeals thereby upholding the applicants conviction nine years earlier jm had publicly expressed his support for and trust in judge m in connection with another case in which she had been the investigating judge and the applicant had been acting for a civil party even though jms expressed position dated back several years it is nevertheless true that judge m was already investigating the borrel case at the time when jm made his statement that this case had major media and political repercussions and that it has since undergone numerous developments moreover the rouen court of appeal in its judgment of july itself pointed out that the church of scientology case in which judge m was suspected of being responsible for the disappearance of evidence had been referred to the investigation division of the paris court of appeal upon an application by the applicant two days before the publication of the offending article in which that fact had been mentioned the court thus finds that there was clear opposition between the applicant and judge m both in the case for which she had received the support of judge j m and in that where j m was sitting as a judge of the court of cassation it is also noteworthy that jms support had been expressed in an official context at the general meeting of the judges of the paris tribunal de grande instance and that it was quite general in nature this is sufficient for the court to come to the conclusion that in the circumstances of the case serious doubts could be raised as to the impartiality of the court of cassation and the applicants fears in that connection could be regarded as objectively justified there has accordingly been a violation of article of the convention in the present case ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained of a violation of his right to freedom of expression he relied on article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court finds that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions without disputing the fact that the interference constituted by his conviction was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim the applicant submitted that the restriction imposed on him was unnecessary and disproportionate referring to the courts caselaw in such matters the applicant indicated that as regards criminal proceedings it was essential for journalists to be able to obtain information from legallyassisted civil parties parties who were not in fact bound by the secrecy of the judicial investigation he added that it was thus important for the civil partys lawyer to be able to express criticisms even harsh ones as otherwise the information accessible to the public would be unreasonably restricted the applicant submitted that the investigation into judge borrels death was part of a sensitive criminal case which had received significant media coverage as the court had already had occasion to observe and the circumstances were such that it raised political and diplomatic issues which warranted a greater degree of information in particular on the subject of how the judicial investigation was proceeding he referred to july and sarl libération v france no echr in his view when reasons of state were at stake in a given case the lawyers freedom of speech had to be at least equal to that of the journalist and the press because faced with the obstruction of the state authorities the lawyer was the crucial goad in making sure that the truth was not stifled he considered it important even ex post facto to inform the public about the reasons underlying any shortcomings in the judicial investigation like those in the case relating to the death of judge borrel he added that it was therefore as a lawyer and solely for the defence of his clients interests that he had explained to the journalist why he and his colleague had called upon the minister of justice seeking an investigation by the general inspectorate of judicial services this being the only possible course of action in those circumstances the applicant was of the opinion that the comments he had made to the journalist were reasonable and that while he had harshly criticised the judges action he had not insulted them or impugned their honour but had shown the dignity and moderation required of a lawyer he added that he had been wrongly accused of being driven by personal animosity and of seeking to discredit the judges he stated that the action he had taken in the scientology case had been successful because the indictments division had withdrawn the case from judge m and the french state had been ordered to pay compensation to the victims families for gross negligence on the part of the courts as to the proportionality of the sanction the applicant emphasised that the harshness of the penalties imposed on him both civil and criminal was such as to deter him from speaking in the media to denounce any shortcomings in the judicial system he concluded that the restriction on his freedom of expression was not necessary in a democratic society or proportionate to the aim pursued the government for their part also took the view that the interference was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim as to the necessity of the interference they referred to the courts caselaw and observed that in the present case the need to limit freedom of expression stemmed not only from the particularly harsh comments but also from the context in which they had been made they further emphasised the sensitive nature of the investigation into judge borrels death and the significant media interest in the case they did not deny that the questions of general interest covered by the press included those concerning the functioning of the judicial system or that the press constituted a means whereby public opinion could ensure that judges assumed their responsibilities in accordance with their mission the government observed however that a lawyers freedom of expression could not be equal to that of a journalist and that it could be subject to restrictions lawyers as holders of legal office were required to contribute to the proper functioning of the justice system and to the confidence that it was supposed to inspire they thus had to show a degree of restraint in the exercise of their duties the state therefore had to be able to impose sanctions where such confidence and the proper functioning of the courts were undermined they emphasised that it could be seen from the offending passages that they were directed in an unequivocal manner at two judges in terms that impugned their honour in the governments submission the applicant had not merely expressed a general criticism of the courts but had deliberately made biased comments without the slightest prudence his remarks had not contributed in any way to an exchange of ideas and had gone further than mere participation in a debate on the functioning of the justice system the government further observed that the domestic courts had carefully scrutinised the offending comments and had found them unquestionably to cause harm to the reputation of the two judges by suggesting that they had failed in their professional duties and obligations they had thus overstepped the bounds of admissible criticism they added that the accusations suggesting that there might have been some concealment of evidence from the case file on the part of judge m were particularly serious in that they were capable of engaging the judges criminal liability they should thus have been supported by particularly wellsubstantiated and precise information the government indicated that the domestic courts assessed the defence of good faith in the light of the provisions of article of the convention and the four criteria that had to be fulfilled concurrently the legitimacy of the aim pursued the absence of personal animosity the seriousness of the investigation carried out or of the evidence obtained by the author of the comments and the prudence shown in expressing them in the present case the court of appeal had held that those conditions were not satisfied and that the attacks had amounted to a settling of scores in the governments submission the applicant could not argue that the offending comments made outside the courtroom constituted a defence strategy as there were other means by which he could have expressed his views the applicant had in fact used those means and had obtained in a judgment of june the withdrawal of the case from the two judges they added that the applicant had not been at fault for expressing himself outside the courtroom but for using excessive comments whereas he could have criticised the handling of the case in harsh terms without impugning the honour of state officials the government therefore took the view that the grounds given by the domestic courts in rejecting the defence of good faith had been pertinent and sufficient and that the absence of moderation and prudence had rendered the interference necessary as to the proportionality of the sanction the government argued that it could not be regarded as excessive or capable of having a chilling effect on the exercise of freedom of expression the government concluded that the interference had been necessary in a democratic society in order to ensure the protection of rights set out in paragraph of article of the convention the courts assessment the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient and whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see among other authorities lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc nos and echr xi it reiterates in this connection that in order to assess the justification of an impugned statement a distinction needs to be made between statements of fact and value judgments while the existence of facts can be demonstrated the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article the classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities in particular the domestic courts however even where a statement amounts to a value judgment there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it failing which it will be excessive see for example lindon otchakovsky laurens and july cited above moreover as regards the impugned comments the court reiterates that it always has regard to the special role of the judiciary in society as the guarantors of justice judges and prosecutors must enjoy public confidence if they are to be successful in carrying out their duties it may therefore prove necessary to protect them against destructive attacks that are essentially unfounded especially as they are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying see rizos and daskas v greece no may in addition the court observes that the special status of lawyers gives them a key position in the administration of justice as intermediaries between the public and the courts such a position explains the usual restrictions on the conduct of members of the bar see casado coca v spain february series a no a however as the court has previously had occasion to state lawyers are entitled to freedom of expression too and to comment in public on the administration of justice provided that their criticism does not overstep certain bounds see amihalachioaie v moldova no echr iii in that connection account must be taken of the need to strike the right balance between the various interests involved which include the publics right to receive information about matters of general interest or the functioning of the judicial system the requirements of the proper administration of justice the dignity of the legal profession and the reputation of the judiciary see schöpfer v switzerland may reports iii in the present case the court notes that the applicant made statements to a journalist from the daily newspaper le monde and they were reported in an article published on september under the headline borrel case judge ms impartiality called into question in that article mrs borrels lawyers including the applicant accused the investigating judge of displaying conduct which was completely at odds with the principles of impartiality and fairness and of having with her colleague omitted to register an item from the case file and to transmit it to her successor after referring to a note from the djibouti public prosecutor addressed to judge m in rather friendly terms the article stated that the lawyers including the applicant were obviously furious and that according to the latter that document demonstrated the extent of the connivance which existed between the djibouti prosecutor and the french judges and which was quite simply outrageous the court notes that the applicant did not confine himself in the article to factual statements about the failure to transmit the cassette and the presence of a letter from the djibouti prosecutor inside the cassette cover he had accompanied those factual observations with value judgments which cast doubt on the impartiality and fairness of judge m and alleged that there was some connivance between the investigating judges and the djibouti prosecutor the court further notes that it was found by the tribunal de grande instance that the applicant had not disputed the defamatory nature of his comments and that he stood by the substance of his accusations which he regarded as well founded see paragraph above furthermore the applicant and a fellow lawyer had on the previous day september sent a letter to the minister of justice containing the same claims and calling for an investigation by the general inspectorate of judicial services into the numerous shortcomings that had been brought to light in the course of the judicial investigation into judge borrels death see paragraph above the court notes lastly that the investigation file had already been removed from judge m by a decision of the investigation division of the paris court of appeal dated june judge m was thus no longer handling the case when the applicant made his statements about her working methods in the case in those circumstances the court finds that the applicant publicly attacked in a mainstream daily newspaper the investigating judge and the functioning of the judicial system just one day after contacting the minister of justice without waiting for a response to his request even if his aim had been to alert the public with regard to possible problems in the functioning of the justice system which the court has acknowledged to be a matter of public interest see kudeshkina v russia no february the applicant did so in particularly virulent terms with the risk of influencing not only the minister of justice but also the investigation division which was examining his complaint in the scientology case see paragraph above it goes without saying that freedom of expression is not denied to lawyers who are certainly entitled to comment in public on the administration of justice but their criticism must not overstep certain bounds see schöpfer cited above having regard to the key role played by lawyers in this area it is legitimate to expect them to contribute to the smooth functioning of the justice system and thus to the maintaining of public confidence in that system ibid the court reiterates that the press is one of the means by which politicians and public opinion can verify that judges are discharging their heavy responsibilities in a manner that is in conformity with the aim which is the basis of the task entrusted to them see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no and july and sarl libération cited above the primary task of lawyers is to defend their clients and they have available to them judicial remedies by which to seek redress for possible shortcomings in the justice system in the present case the applicant had already used such remedies and had thus far been successful having regard to the foregoing the court finds that in expressing himself as he did the applicant behaved in a manner which overstepped the limits that lawyers have to observe in publicly criticising the justice system this conclusion is reinforced by the seriousness of the accusations made in the article and in particular those alleging that the judges conduct was completely at odds with the principles of impartiality and fairness and that there had been some connivance between her and the djibouti prosecutor the court takes the view that in the circumstances of the case the domestic courts were justified in finding that the comments in question made by a lawyer were serious and insulting visàvis judge m that they were capable of undermining public confidence in the judicial system unnecessarily given that the judicial investigation in the case had been assigned to another judge several months previously and that there were sufficient grounds to find the applicant guilty contrast foglia v switzerland no december moreover having regard to the chronology of the events it could be inferred from the applicants comments as the court of appeal noted that they were driven by some personal animosity towards judge m see paragraph above the court reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see cumpănă and mazăre v romania gc no echr xi and brunet lecomte and others v france no february as regards the proportionality of the sanction the court notes that the applicant was found guilty of an offence and ordered to pay a fine however in view of the margin of appreciation left to contracting states by article of the convention a criminal measure as a response to defamation can not as such be considered disproportionate to the aim pursued see radio france and others v france no echr ii secondly the amount of the fine imposed on the applicant euros does not appear excessive the same is true of the euros in damages that he was ordered to pay to the civil parties jointly with his two codefendants in those circumstances and having regard to the content of the impugned comments the court considers that the measures imposed on the applicant were not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued in the light of the foregoing the court finds that the authorities did not overstep their margin of appreciation in sentencing the applicant accordingly there has been no violation of article of the convention iii application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court finds that there has been a violation of the convention or the protocols thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party a damage the applicant claimed euros eur in respect of the pecuniary damage that he alleged to have sustained he included therein the fines and the damages that he had been ordered to pay together with the court costs that he had had to reimburse to the civil parties in respect of nonpecuniary damage he requested eur the government observed that the applicant had only furnished proof of payment for the sum of eur in may and that it was jointly with the newspapers publication director and the journalist that he had been ordered to pay damages and court costs to the civil parties as to nonpecuniary damage the government argued that the finding of a violation would be sufficient the court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged it therefore rejects this claim however it finds it appropriate to award the applicant eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage b costs and expenses the applicant also claimed eur for the costs and expenses incurred before the court he produced invoices from two lawyers and copies of the cheques used to pay those sums the government observed that the invoices thus furnished had not contained any details as to the nature of the services rendered and did not enable a connection to be established with the present case they argued that in any event the sum should be reduced to fairer proportions proposing eur according to the courts caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum in the present case regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria the court considers it reasonable to award the applicant the sum of eur for the proceedings before it c default interest the court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the european central bank to which should be added three percentage points for these reasons the court declares unanimously the application admissible holds unanimously that there has been a violation of article of the convention holds by six votes to one that there has been no violation of article of the convention holds by six votes to onea that the respondent state is to pay the applicant within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with article of the convention the following amount eur six thousand euros plus any tax that may be chargeable in respect of nonpecuniary damageb that from the expiry of the abovementioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage points holds unanimouslya that the respondent state is to pay the applicant within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with article of the convention the following amount eur six thousand euros plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant in respect of costs and expensesb that from the expiry of the abovementioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage points dismisses unanimously the remainder of the applicants claim for just satisfaction done in french and notified in writing on july pursuant to rule and of the rules of court claudia westerdiek mark villiger registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the separate opinions of judges yudkivska and lemmens are annexed to this judgment mvcwpartly dissenting opinion of judge yudkivskathe present case concerns the balance between a lawyers freedom of speech and the need to uphold the authority of the judiciary the importance of such balance can not be overestimated assessing the competing interests in this case i am unable to share the opinion of my colleagues who have found the interference with the applicants freedom of expression to be proportionate in my opinion the majority in the chamber did not take full account of a certain number of important facts the first issue is that of the specific role of lawyers in addition to the need to uphold the authority of the judiciary lawyers have an obligation to defend their clients interests zealously the applicant was furious to learn that the judge had not deemed it necessary to register and transmit to her successor an item of evidence that he regarded as important he referred the matter to the minister of justice and gave an interview to a newspaper the majority in the chamber shared the opinion of the domestic judicial authorities namely that the expressions used by the applicant reflected his animosity and that there had been no reason to criticise the judge so harshly especially as the case had already been withdrawn from her responsibility for drawing attention to the shortcomings of judicial investigations and proceedings in the interest of the courts themselves lies precisely with the lawyers there is no doubt that the expressions used by a lawyer must be acceptable without seeking to humiliate or offend those involved in judicial proceedings including the judge as the aim of such comments by a lawyer is not to offend but to shed light on any shortcomings an aim that in my opinion was pursued in the present case it is then very difficult for me to find sufficient grounds on which to limit such expression the comments made by the lawyer were not directed at the judge in person but were critical of her conduct during the proceedings in question thus the applicants remarks to the effect that she had displayed conduct which was completely at odds with the principles of impartiality and fairness and that there had been some connivance between her and the public prosecutor of djibouti as recognised by the majority were value judgments based on an undeniable fact the failure to transmit the cassette and the presence of a letter from the djibouti prosecutor inside its cover see paragraph of the judgment accordingly the comments in question even though they contain a certain degree of exaggeration should not be regarded as an unwarranted personal attack but rather as an interpretation of a matter of great public importance the interview with the applicant was part of the public debate concerning this highprofile case the matter of public interest the proper administration of justice concerned him above all in his capacity as lawyer for the victims who as indicated in the mor v france case had a clear interest both for their defence and for the dispassionate and independent judicial investigation in respect of their complaint and giving an interview to the press was a legitimate part of their defence given that the case had aroused interest in the media and among the general public for that reason i am unable to accept the majoritys arguments to the effect that the applicants criticism was exaggerated because judge m was no longer handling the case when the applicant made his statements about her working methods in the case paragraph the applicants criticism precisely concerned judge ms conduct after the transmission of the case to another judge and in particular the fact that part of the evidence had not been passed on according to the applicant that omission could have undermined the ongoing judicial investigation and he considered it necessary to alert the minister of justice and public opinion the majority also found fault with the applicant for having given the impugned interview just one day after contacting the minister of justice without waiting for a response to his request see paragraph however the referral of the matter to the minister of justice and the interview in the newspaper clearly had different aims the aim of the first was to trigger disciplinary proceedings against the judge that being a procedural remedy available to a lawyer in respect of shortcomings on the part of the judiciary the aim of the second action was to draw the attention of the general public to failings in the judicial investigation concerning this wellknown case i do not believe that one can find fault with a lawyer who has procedural remedies by which to make good any shortcomings in judicial proceedings whether he uses them as in the present case or not for having prompted a public debate as those two paths lead in different directions in addition any disciplinary sanctions imposed on a judge will not necessarily be known to the public even though clear failings could be seen in the judges work in the present case in any event a lawyers mission is in the very interest of the judicial system to use his best endeavours to ensure that the judicial investigation is conducted objectively and impartially as the court pointed out in kyprianou for the public to have confidence in the administration of justice they must have confidence in the ability of the legal profession to provide effective representation the principle of fair justice encompasses the right to be assisted by an independent lawyer who discharges his professional duties without excessive restriction or interference the possibility of freely expressing his opinion is an indispensable condition for a lawyer to be able to fulfil his principal professional duty the defence of his clients interests indeed the lawyers speech arguments and persuasions whether oral or written is his main resource as my honourable colleague judge casadevall has written on this subject speech the sole weapon together with the pen or the keyboard and a very simple but nevertheless formidable one at the lawyers disposal when he is defending a party to proceedings the possibility of filing a complaint with a disciplinary body is not really an appropriate means of expression when it comes to a lawyers freedom of speech moreover public debate as to a problem arising in judicial proceedings is necessary in a democratic society it is clear that any criticism by a lawyer must be assessed in a very stringent manner for the public has more confidence in the comments of a lawyer who has inside knowledge of the case than for example those of journalists reporting on a trial in the media but it would not be rational to leave the possibility of criticism only to outside observers for a wall of silence imposed on professionals in relation to a trial that is important for public opinion would discredit the court in the public eye more than the criticisms emanating from those professionals it is precisely the lawyers who appear in the case before the court and who have the requisite qualification to see the faults and defects in the proceedings that the public count upon to receive information to turn court proceedings into a closed forum where one should not air ones dirty washing would in my opinion affect the image of the judicial system more than explicit criticism provided of course that it does not become offensive or purely speculative with that in mind i do not think that the expressions used by the applicant can be regarded as unfounded attacks lastly the lawyers conviction for making value judgments appears disproportionate the very existence of criminal proceedings has a chilling effect lawyers defending their clients rights should not have to fear prosecution on that account having regard to the foregoing i have reached the conclusion that in the present case the applicants rights under article of the convention were not duly upheld partly dissenting opinion of judge lemmensi voted with the majority in finding a violation of article of the convention and no violation of article however i disagreed with my colleagues as regards the application of article of the convention in the present case the only violation found by the court concerned the composition of the bench of the criminal division of the court of cassation which dismissed the applicants appeal on points of law the violation related more specifically to only one of the ten judges on the bench the court did not take the view that the court of cassations decision was open to criticism in terms of its content having regard to the convention on the contrary it dismissed the article complaint in those circumstances i am of the view that the finding of a violation of article of the convention would in itself have constituted sufficient redress for the nonpecuniary damage sustained by the applicant nikula v finland no echr ii see mutatis mutandis

30,the first applicant mr h armellini was born in and lives in hard the second applicant mr f andres was born in and lives in bregenz they are both journalists employed by the third applicant zeitungs und verlags gmb h a limited liability company with its seat of business in schwarzach the applicant company publishes the regional newspaper neue voralberger tageszeitung a the background of the case at the beginning of rh a german football referee admitted to having participated in bet rigging wettbetrug by manipulating football matches together with other persons in particular the brothers fs ms and as rh told the police that he knew that football matches were also manipulated in greece and austria as regards austria he referred to the football club casino sw bregenz which still existed at the time of the events in b the article published by the applicant company on february an article written by the first and second applicants appeared in the neue voralberger tageszeitung dealing with the german betting scandals links to bregenz on the front page the headline printed in a black box in white read as follows bregenz players bribed with euros eur bregenz spieler mit bestochen below that headline and still in the black box were photographs of at dg and ai and in a yellow box the phrase the investigators are at the heels of this trio they may have manipulated matches for the bettingmafia diesem trio sind die fahnder auf den fersen es soll für wett mafia spiele manipuliert haben in the upper left corner a little box contained the following phrase terrible suspicion against football pros confirmed schlimmer vedacht gegen fussball profis erhärtet the main article on this subject written by the first and second applicants appeared on page the headline read as follows sold and betrayed the team for eur für team verkauft und verraten the article stated that the three football players had been bribed by the bettingmafia with eur for three matches bets for these casino sw bregenz matches had been placed in the stuttgart area germany in one match which had ended with the result of against casino sw bregenz the goalkeeper at had made serious mistakes as expected and another player ai had been replaced because of his poor performance dg had also been playing in that match the reason for the manipulations was the players financial difficulties they had not received their salary for months they had all signed a public statement prepared by the management of the club denying their involvement in the betting scandal on the following page there was an article under the headline a result shocks a second time ein schockt ein zweites mal in which a football match of november was reviewed again and it was hinted that the poor performance of some of the players was connected to the bettingscandal c the criminal proceedings on march at dg and ai filed a private prosecution privatanklage against the applicants before the feldkirch regional court they argued that the accusation raised in the article published by the applicant company in its newspaper on february that they had accepted bribes and manipulated football matches was particularly serious for a professional football player and his professional reputation this accusation which was untrue constituted defamation and they requested the court to convict the first and second applicants of this offence they indicated in particular the following passages of the article as defamatoryi terrible suspicion against footballpros confirmed bregenz players bribed with eur schlimmer vedacht gegen fussball profis erhärtet bregenz spieler mit bestochenii sold and betrayed the team for eur für team verkauft und verrateniii bregenz players at dg and ai were bribed eur for their team to lose three matches die bregenz spieler at dg und ai sollen bestochen worden sein damit ihr team drei spiele verliertiv regarding the third plaintiff at at had made contact with the croatian bettingmafia den kontakt zur kroatischen wettmafia soll at hergestellt haben they also claimed compensation from the applicant company for the harm caused and requested that the judgment be published in its newspaper on march the feldkirch regional court ordered the applicant company to publish within five days a short piece kurze mitteilung on the institution of criminal proceedings for defamation in respect of the article at issue on april the applicants commented on the charges against them they argued that they had only voiced a suspicion against the plaintiffs but that in any event their statements were true or at least the first and second applicants had had good reason to believe that they were true which would rule out punishment between april and december the regional court held four hearings in the case in which it heard several witnesses inter alia ke a freelance journalist working for the third applicants newspaper and who had contacted two informants who had wished to remain anonymous and rh see above rh spoke about his contacts with the s brothers since may and stated that one of them fs had contacts in austria in particular the football club casino sw bregenz in his opinion two players of that team were in contact with fs but he did not give any names or other details on december the regional court found that the incriminated statements from the article of february amounted to defamation convicted the first and second applicants of that offence and sentenced them to a fine of eur and eur respectively suspended on probation for a probationary period of three years it ordered the applicant company to pay compensation of eur to each plaintiff and to publish an extract of the present judgment in its newspaper as regards the impugned article the regional court paid particular attention to its visual appearance which through its layout and presentation in particular the printing in white in a large black box conveyed to the reader the impression that the investigators were about to catch the pictured persons who had filled their pockets with money by using dirty tricks that first impression was not mitigated by the small reference to a suspicion in the upper left corner the same was true for the headline on page which read sold and betrayed the team for eur this was a leading question which already contained the answer and again that first impression could hardly be mitigated by the use of the subjunctive in some phrases of the article itself the court therefore concluded that seen as a whole the article created the impression of being a statement of facts about the scandal and not a genuine expression of a suspicion the regional court therefore examined whether the accused had acted with due journalistic diligence when they considered these statements as true or if they could prove their veracity as regards the first element the regional court accepted that there was a public interest in being informed on the question of whether or not players of the casino sw bregenz team had actually been involved in a betting scandal but found that the first and second applicants had not acted with sufficient professional diligence they had not personally conducted any research to verify the wellfoundedness of the rumours but had merely relied on the research of ke a freelance collaborator with the newspaper and had not checked the reliability of the sources anonymous informants not known to them furthermore they had not given at dg and ai an opportunity to react even though there had been important new elements going beyond a general suspicion of involvement in the betting scandal to which they had already reacted in the past namely that they had received a specific amount eur for manipulating three football matches in the summer of turning to the proof of truth put forward by the applicants the regional court observed that dg and ai had only been accused by kes two informants x and y of being involved in the betting scandal and these informants had not given any details nor stated that they themselves had witnessed a transaction also rh when heard by the court did not refer to them directly or indirectly there was clearly no proof of the truth as regards at the regional court observed that he had lied when he stated that he did not know fs that fs had repeatedly visited bregenz and that there had been football matches in which that player had given a very poor performance also the informants x and y had stated that at was involved in the betting scandal these were arguments speaking in favour of his involvement in the betting scandal but there were also arguments speaking against it was understandable that at had not admitted to knowing fs immediately when all kinds of suspicions were discussed in connection with the betting scandal as fs was one of the principal persons involved in that scandal furthermore there was only evidence that fs had visited bregenz on various occasions between autumn and may whereas the football match which in the eyes of the authors of the article was particularly suspicious had taken place in november according to the information given by x and y fs had paid the three accused football players eur in summer for three matches which had not yet taken place that did not coincide with his habits as described in detail by rh lastly the amount claimed by x and y namely eur was not plausible given that casino sw bregenz had been at the very end of the national football league table in austria throughout the season of and the quota for bets on that team losing a match would have been so small that it would not have justified the investment of a considerable sum weighing all these elements the regional court concluded that the applicants had not succeeded in proving the truth of the statements made in the impugned article as regards the compensation under section of the media act the regional court found that the particular seriousness of the accusations raised and the adverse effect they could have on the career of a professional footballer justified the sum of compensation granted on january the applicants appealed against this judgment they argued that the impugned article did not contain a statement of fact but merely a suspicion against at dg and ai moreover the first and second applicants had fully complied with journalistic ethics as ke and the applicants had acted as a team there was no need to check further the information received and at that stage of the investigations there had also been no need to give the plaintiffs an opportunity to react to the information to be published on april the innsbruck court of appeal dismissed the appeal of the first and second applicants but partially granted the appeal of the applicant company and reduced the amount of compensation to eur for each plaintiff it found that the regional court had carefully weighed the arguments and had arrived at a correct and wellreasoned judgment it agreed with the regional court that the first and second applicants had not reported on a mere suspicion but had presented their allegations as facts which they had failed to prove ii relevant domestic law if a publication in the media viewed objectively constitutes defamation under section of the criminal code or an insult under section of the criminal code the insulted person may claim nonpecuniary damages against the media owner pursuant to section of the media act section of the criminal code in so far as relevant reads as follows as it may be perceived by a third party anyone who makes an accusation against another of having a contemptible character or attitude or of behaving contrary to honour or morality and of such a nature as to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six months or a fine anyone who commits this offence in a printed document by broadcasting or otherwise in such a way as to make the defamation accessible to a broad section of the public shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine the person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true as regards the offence defined in paragraph he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to assume that the statement was true section of the media act in force at the time of the events read as follows if in a medium the presence of the factual elements of the offences of defamation is established the person concerned has against the owner of the medium a claim for compensation of the prejudice suffered the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicants complained that their conviction for defamation and the order to pay compensation violated their right to freedom of expression they relied on article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the court notes that it is common ground between the parties that the feldkirch regional courts judgment of october upheld by the court of appeal which convicted the first and second applicants of defamation and ordered the applicant company to pay damages constituted an interference with the their right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the convention an interference contravenes article of the convention unless it is prescribed by law pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph and is necessary in a democratic society for achieving such an aim or aims the court considers and this was acknowledged by the parties that the interference was prescribed by law namely by article of the criminal code and section of the media act the court further finds and this was likewise not disputed between the parties that the interference served a legitimate aim namely the protection of the reputation or rights of others within the meaning of article of the convention the parties argument concentrated on the question of whether the interference had been necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention the parties submissions the applicants submitted that the subject matter of the articles published in the applicant companys newspaper concerned issues of particular public interest namely fraud connected with manipulated football games in order to report correctly on this issue the applicants had also to reveal the identity of the private plaintiffs in the defamation proceedings who were public figures because at the time of the events at dg and ai were football players for an austrian football club in the first league therefore the public had a right to be informed of these events they further submitted that the article of february merely reported on a suspicion that at dg and ai had manipulated football matches accordingly the headline on the first page stated terrible suspicion against football players confirmed and under the picture it was stated that the investigators are at the heels of this trio they may have manipulated matches for the betting mafia in the article on page of the issue the headlines raised the question of whether the team had been betrayed and sold for eur the subheadline stated that there was new evidence in the betting scandal this article also included the statements made by at dg and ai that they had nothing to do with the bet rigging in the applicants view all requirements of journalistic diligence had in every way been fulfilled it was a fact that the police had investigated the betting scandal and ke a freelance journalist working for the applicant companys newspaper had obtained information from two informants whom he considered trustworthy and this information corresponded to the results of the police investigations the applicants therefore reported correctly on an existing suspicion against at dg and ai and the conviction of the first and second applicants for defamation and the order to pay damages were in breach of article of the convention the government submitted that the articles at issue concerned a matter of public interest which also extended to the identity of at dg and ai who had to be considered as public figures since they played for an austrian football club in the first league at the time as regards the contents of the article or articles published the regional court carefully examined the meaning of the incriminated passages of the text in the context of the article as a whole and arrived at the conclusion that the text did not limit itself to voicing the suspicion that dg ai and at had manipulated football matches but presented these accusations as facts the government pointed out that at the trial the applicants had claimed that their statements were essentially true and that in any event they had acted with the required journalistic diligence and therefore had good reason to believe that their statements were true however the regional court found that the applicants had failed to prove the truth because they had not acted with sufficient journalistic diligence in particular they had not given dg ai and at a fair opportunity to comment on the charges raised because they had failed to confront them with the most relevant charge namely that they had received the sum of eur for manipulating one particular match of the casino sw bregenz football club this was not an irrelevant detail but as highlighted by the headline on the front page and in the article itself was a central element moreover the sanction imposed on the applicants was not disproportionate the first and second applicants were sentenced to a moderate fine suspended on probation and the applicant company was ordered to make compensation payments under article of the media act in an amount which could not be considered excessive the courts assessmenta general principles according to the courts wellestablished caselaw the test of necessity in a democratic society requires the court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a pressing social need whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient see the sunday times v the united kingdom no april series a no in assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation this power of appreciation is not however unlimited but goes hand in hand with a european supervision by the court whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article see bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction the court can not confine itself to considering the impugned court decisions in isolation it must look at them in the light of the case as a whole including the materials for which reproach is made against the applicant company and the context in which they were published krone verlag gmb h co kg v austria no february with further references an important factor for the courts determination is the essential function of the press in a democratic society although the press must not overstep certain bounds in particular in respect of the reputation and rights of others or the proper administration of justice its duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities information and ideas on all matters of public interest see bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above and as a recent authority flinkkilä and others v finland no april by reason of the duties and responsibilities inherent in the exercise of freedom of expression the safeguard afforded by article to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and providing reliable and precise information in accordance with the ethics of journalism see fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i and as a recent authority eerikäinen and others v finland no february whilst it is true that the methods of objective and balanced reporting may vary considerably and that it is therefore not for this court nor for the national courts to substitute their own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted jersild v denmark september series a no editorial discretion is not unbounded not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas the public also has a right to receive them were it otherwise the press would be unable to play its vital role of public watchdog observer and guardian v the united kingdom november series a no thorgeir thorgeirson v iceland june series a no bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above gutiérrez suárez v spain no june in this respect the court reiterates that article does not guarantee wholly unrestricted freedom of expression to the press even with respect to coverage of matters of serious public concern while enjoying the protection afforded by the convention journalists must when exercising their duties abide by the principles of responsible journalism namely to act in good faith provide accurate and reliable information objectively reflect the opinions of those involved in a public debate and refrain from pure sensationalism see novaya gazeta and borodyanskiy v russia no march with further references and mutatis mutandis bargão and domingos correia v portugal nos and november the subject matter at issue in this case relates on the one hand to the right of the press under article of the convention to inform the public on matters of public interest and concern and on the other to the states positive obligations under article of the convention to protect the reputation of persons to whom such proceedings relate when verifying whether the authorities struck a fair balance between two protected values guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in this type of case freedom of expression protected by article and the right to respect for private life enshrined in article the court must balance the public interest in the publication of the information and the need to protect a persons reputation see axel springer ag v germany gc no february and pfeifer v austria no november the balancing of individual interests which may well be contradictory is a difficult matter and contracting states must have a margin of appreciation in this respect since the national authorities are in principle better placed than this court to assess whether or not there is a pressing social need capable of justifying an interference with one of the rights guaranteed by the convention see mgn limited cited above and egeland and hanseid v norway cited above in cases such as the present one which require the right to respect for private life to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression the court considers that the outcome of the application should not in theory vary according to whether it has been lodged with the court under article of the convention by the person who was the subject of the article or under article by the publisher indeed as a matter of principle these rights deserve equal respect accordingly the margin of appreciation should in theory be the same in both cases von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr b application of these principles to the present case in the present case the applicant companys newspaper neue vorarlberger tageszeitung published on february an article written by the first and second applicants in that article three professional football players of the casino sw bregenz football team at dg and ai were accused of having accepted a bribe of eur for manipulating three football matches the three players instituted proceedings for defamation against the first and second applicants and for compensation against the applicant company on december the regional court convicted the first and second applicants of defamation and imposed fines in the amount of eur and eur respectively and ordered the applicant company to pay compensation in the amount of eur to the plaintiffs upon appeal the court of appeal maintained the conviction of the first and second applicants and reduced the amount of compensation to eur for each plaintiff like the parties the court considers that the article concerned a subject matter which was of considerable public interest namely manipulation of sports games and fraud connected thereto and the interest of the general public to be informed on such events did not only extend to the football clubs engaged in competitions but also extended to the individual players who were known to the readers of sport pages as regards the contents of the impugned article the court observes that the applicants did not discuss in a general manner a matter of public concern but rather directly attacked three football players from the casino sw bregenz football club and accused them of having accepted money in exchange for manipulating football matches the regional court carefully examined the character of the article and besides the wording also took into account its context layout and presentation in particular it found that the manner in which the text was printed drawing the readers attention to the accusation raised and the use of photographs and leading questions created an overall impression of being a statement of facts about the scandal and not a genuine expression of a suspicion in this respect the court considers that accusations of manipulating football matches can seriously damage the personal and professional reputation of football players and may have important financial repercussions for them and the football clubs concerned as they touch upon the central ethical conception of sports while the applicants claimed before the court that they had merely expressed a suspicion and that they had had sufficient factual basis for their suspicion before the regional court they had claimed that their statements were true and offered to prove the truth of their allegations these accusations were extremely serious and given that the accusations were concrete detailed and addressed to persons named in the article the court considers that they should have had a solid factual basis as regards the proof of truth offered by the applicants the court observes that the regional court in its judgment exhaustively assessed the evidence submitted by the applicants and concluded that the truth of the allegations was not supported by this evidence from the material before it also the court does not consider that the applicants could have relied on such a solid factual basis as required by austrian law the regional court also examined whether the applicants could rely on the further line of defence under section of the criminal code namely that they had acted with necessary journalistic diligence the court does not consider that the domestic courts set unreasonable requirements for proving the truth of the applicants allegations nor overstretched the requirement of journalistic diligence given that the applicants reported on the matter giving particular details which for example concerned the amount of the bribe the number of football matches manipulated extensively featuring one particular match and drew readers attention to these details the court does not find it unreasonable that the austrian courts considered one statutory declaration signed by the players of the football club and drawn up by the managment of the club as insufficient to give at dg and ai a reasonable opportunity to comment on the charges prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no lastly the court considers that the interference with the applicants right under article of the convention to impart information was proportionate the first and second applicants who had written the article at issue were sentenced to fines in the amount of eur and eur respectively suspended on probation for a probationary period of three years and the applicant company was ordered to pay compensation for the injury caused to the persons whose reputation had been damaged that amount initially fixed by the regional court at eur was eventually reduced to eur for each plaintiff these amounts appear reasonable taking into account the length of the article and its contents which on account of the details given and the photographs published constituted a serious interference with the plaintiffs personal and professional reputation in sum the court finds that the respondent state acted within its margin of appreciation in assessing the need to protect the plaintiffs reputation in the defamation proceedings instituted by them it is satisfied that the restriction on the applicants right to freedom of expression resulting from the judgments of the regional court and the court of appeal was supported by reasons that were relevant and sufficient and was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursed there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on april pursuant to rule and of the rules of court søren nielsen khanlar hajiyev registrar president,,,
31,the applicants are journalists at the relevant time they were employed by one of the two national television stations in denmark danmarks radio hereafter dr the first applicant produced a television programme described as a documentary called when the doctor knows best which was broadcast at pm on september and seen by viewers the second applicant was the first applicants superior and responsible for the content of the programme the television programme concerned the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer notably at copenhagen university hospital rigshospitalet where consultant s was in charge of treatment it focused on two types of chemotherapy medication alimta produced by l and vinorelbine produced by f copenhagen university hospital and s used vinorelbine as firstline treatment in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin depending on whether the treatment was related to an operation operable patients or to prolonging life and relieving pain and symptoms inoperable patients three experts participated in the programme a medical doctor from karolinska hospital in sweden a professor from switzerland and a medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany they all used alimta as firstline treatment most often in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin the programme followed four patients and their relatives who told their stories and a narrator spoke as a voiceover throughout the programme in preparation for the programme the first applicant had carried out research on the subject which included inter alia the following on september the european union had approved the marketing of alimta in combination with cisplatin for treatment of patients with inoperable pleural mesothelioma cancer the background for the approval was among others research which had been carried out examining the effect of treatment with alimta in combination with cisplatin as compared to treatment with cisplatin alone a phase iii trial see paragraph below as firstline therapy in july the minister for internal affairs and health replied to various questions posed by members of parliament as to the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer in denmark the minister replied inter alia that there was no proof that an alimtabased treatment was more efficient than other chemotherapybased treatments including that offered in denmark that the combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin which was used at copenhagen university hospital resulted in a oneyear survival rate of and a median lifetime of months which was exactly the survival rate from using the combination of alimta and cisplatin but that there had been no direct comparison of the two treatments and that there was no internationally accepted standard chemotherapy for the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer but that several single and combined treatments were used on june copenhagen university hospital produced a memorandum about pleural mesothelioma cancer and its treatment which was sent to dr it stressed that international studies including of vinorelbine and alimta had not shown that any twocombination regime was superior to other twocombination regimes that information was confirmed by the professor from switzerland in an email of june and by the medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany in an email of june the memorandum also referred to a fund aimed at developing research on pleural mesothelioma cancer in the amount of danish kroner dkk equal to approximately euros eur received by s from company f which produces vinorelbine the money had been used to pay nurses and students and for data collection it emerged that there had been no financial profit for the doctors involved having received the abovementioned memorandum the first applicant again contacted the professor from switzerland and the medical doctor at grosshandorf hospital in germany in essence they confirmed in subsequent emails of and july that since there had been no direct comparative clinical studies there was no scientific evidence that one twocombination regime was superior to another twocombination regime medical research studies involving human subjects are called clinical trials they are divided into different stages called phases generally it can be said that the earliest phase trials may look at whether a drug is safe or at its sideeffects a later phase ii trial aims to find out whether the treatment works well enough for which types of cancer the treatment works more about side effects and how to manage them and more about the best dose to use a later phase iii trial aims to test whether a new treatment is better than existing treatments standard treatment these trials may compare a completely new treatment with the standard treatment or with different doses or ways of giving a standard treatment a the proceedings before the courts subsequent to the broadcast on september of the television programme on october copenhagen university hospital and s instituted defamation proceedings before the copenhagen city court københavns byret against the director of dr and the two applicants maintaining that the latter in the programme in question had made direct and indirect accusations covered by article of the penal code straffeloven against copenhagen university hospital and s of malpractice regarding certain patients suffering from pleural mesothelioma cancer allegedly resulting in the patients unnecessary death and shortening of life in the interest of ss professional prestige and private finances before the city court the applicants s and medical director h for copenhagen university hospital gave evidence the first applicant stated inter alia that she had not criticised copenhagen university hospital for improper treatment causing death her message was only to point out that the substance of alimta had been better documented than the substance of vinorelbine she had collected statements from patients and experts but could not state herself whether alimta was a better product than vinorelbine the experts had not stated whether alimta in combination with another product was better than vinorelbine in combination with another product however all experts had emphasised that alimta had been evaluated in a phase iii trial for which reason it was a more thoroughly tested product her questions had been answered during her conversations with professor m on october and s on october subsequently no one had been willing to answer her questions that was the only real conversation she had had with s the next time she had called him he had put down the receiver when it had not been possible for her to get any response to her many points of criticism she had contacted h she had wanted statements from both h and s as the programme would be unbalanced if they were not heard some found that alimta had been better documented than vinorelbine she was not aware of any trial demonstrating that a combination with alimta was better than a combination with another medicinal product s stated inter alia the following alimta has been used for secondline therapy in denmark since and since as firstline therapy patients had been given the impression in the media that alimta was a miracle cure therefore copenhagen university hospital had introduced it as an option today alimta is used in combination with carboplatin as the standard therapy for inoperable patients sometimes in autumn the standard therapy for operable patients had been changed to cisplatin in combination with alimta if some patients were offered alimta everybody had to be offered alimta after the programme had been broadcast patients started mistrusting the vinorelbine therapy afterwards it was not possible to perform the trial phase ii on this drug nor would it be possible to obtain funding for the trial therefore no trial had been performed of vinorelbine he had provided the information included in professor ms memorandum of september he had talked to the first applicant several times and had spent a lot of time and energy on explaining cancer therapy he had also lost confidence in the first applicant h stated among other things the approval of alimta by the danish medicines agency for the treatment of mesothelioma only means that a marketing authorisation has been granted for the drug which means that advertisement of the product is permitted vinorelbine has also been approved by the danish medicines agency but for a wide range of oncological therapies in when alimta was tested phase iii the bar had been set quite low the study compared alimta with a clearly inferior treatment that would not actually be offered to anybody it would have been more relevant to study alimta in combination with cisplatin versus vinorelbine with cisplatin s has made a phase ii trial of the standard therapy vinorelbine subsequently the standard therapy regimen has been expanded to include alimta which is not a better product than vinorelbine but eight times more expensive if two drugs are equally effective but one of them is eight times more expensive than the other patients will be offered therapy using the cheaper drug the standard therapies now offered by copenhagen university hospital are vinorelbine in combination with cisplatin for inoperable patients and alimta in combination with cisplatin for operable patients the shift to alimta as the standard therapy at copenhagen university hospital did not reflect that alimta was medically better the applicants programme had had a large impact as patients were asking not to be treated with vinorelbine copenhagen university hospital had therefore had to change medical products because patients had the clear impression that vinorelbine was not as good as alimta it is quite usual for copenhagen university hospital to surrender material to the press and to answer questions but the questions of the first applicant were neverending copenhagen university hospital has spent about a manyear or about dkk responding to inquiries from the first applicant and huge efforts had been made to accommodate her requests the programme had created distrust towards both copenhagen university hospital and s and had created uncertainty in both patients and relatives he had received to hate mails himself by a judgment of april the copenhagen city court found against the applicants and the director of dr and sentenced them each to dayfines of danish kroner dkk the allegations were declared null and void the reasoning was as follows based on the evidence the city court accepts as a fact that in following a phase iii trial emea approved alimta in combination with cisplatin for treating patients suffering from inoperable malignant pleural mesothelioma and that subsequently the same was approved by the danish medicines agency the court also accept as a fact that vinorelbine is a drug dating back more than years whose effect had been documented by clinical experience and approved by the danish medicines agency for a wide range of oncological therapies finally the court also accepts as a fact that it has not been documented that alimta therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product is more effective than vinorelbine therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product as regards the term experimental drug the court accepts as a fact that a drug administered to patients in a trial is referred to as an experimental drug no matter whether the same drug is the standard therapy offered outside the trial setting no matter that the applicants are deemed to have been aware of the above circumstances following their comprehensive research of the matter it was said in the programme that for dying patients s and copenhagen university hospital had prescribed a nonapproved chemotherapy regimen not approved for the diagnosis or which was not the correct chemotherapy and that s and copenhagen university hospital used an experimental drug the worstcase scenario being that patients would die earlier than if they had been treated with an approved substance or that it would have fatal consequences moreover the phrase the only drug with a known effect was used since no account was given in the programme of the abovementioned trials and approval process and the terminology applied for that process the court finds that it would seem to a nonprofessional viewer that alimta was the only effective drug for mesothelioma particularly because the programme linked the treatment of two patients with vinorelbine to their death whereas the prospect of several more years to live was held out to the one patient who had been given alimta therapy in germany moreover the programme also linked ss use of vinorelbine to his personal esteem and his personal research account although the applicants had been made aware of the research grant management procedure though professor ms memorandum of september before the broadcast since no account was given either of the procedure for managing research grants the court also finds in this respect that it would seem to a nonprofessional viewer that s had a personal financial interest in starting vinorelbine treatment rather than alimta the applicants are therefore considered to have violated article of the penal code according to the information on the applicants knowledge after their comprehensive research of the matter the court finds no basis for exempting them from punishment or remitting the penalty under article of the penal code compare also article of the convention the applicants are furthermore jointly and severally liable for paying legal costs of dkk on appeal on june the judgment was upheld by the high court of eastern denmark østre landsret with the following reasoning in the introduction to the programme when the doctor knows best a narrator states among other things a danish doctor is entering a medical congress to show his research results for years he has gone his own way he has treated dying patients with chemotherapy that is not approved later during the programme it is stated at which hospitals one can receive treatment for pleural mesothelioma cancer that these hospitals cooperate with copenhagen university hospital and a reference is made to a named consultant s head of the scandinavian centre for treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer during the various interviews a narrator states inter alia the doctor does not give his patients the only approved medication instead he uses a test medication in the worst scenario that may result in the patients dying earlier than if they had been given the approved substance there is only one approved chemotherapy against pleural mesothelioma cancer but that is not offered to sp one of the patients followed in the programme the doctors chose to treat her with a substance that is not approved for the diagnosis and whose effect on pleural mesothelioma cancer is not substantiated however that chemotherapy turned out to have huge consequences for her sp s can freely choose the medication that he thinks is best there is only one treatment which in comparative studies has proved to have an effect on pleural mesothelioma cancer accordingly that is the only medication which is approved as treatment that medication is called alimta however s chose not to use that medication on his patients thus it has not been proved whether vinorelbine works according to the calculations made by dr close to patients in denmark have been given test medication in the worst scenario that may result in patients dying earlier than if they had been given the approved medication for her sp the lack of effect of treatment by vinorelbine turns out to have had fatal consequences the family k ask themselves why s goes his own way they suspect that he has other interests than those of the patients that suspicion grows when they talk to sks personal doctor it turns out however that s may also have had other reasons for choosing vinorelbine because he has used this medication in medical tests on the patients in a phase when they are fighting for their lives the question remains why does s carry out tests with vinorelbine could it have something to do with the prestige which is implicit in having research articles published we do not know whether it is prestige that impels s thus s will not acknowledge what leading experts agree on namely that alimta is the only medication whose effect is substantiated here it turns out that s has received more than dkk over the last five and a half years from the company f that is the company behind the test medication vinorelbine the money has been paid into ss personal research account dkk is earmarked for the tests s withheld that information the programme ends by informing us among other things that two of the patients who were interviewed have passed away the narrator says inter alia tj who was part of ss tests with vinorelbine died on january with these statements the applicants not only passed on assertions by patients relatives and experts but also took a stand so that the programme undisputedly gave the viewers the impression that malpractice has occurred at copenhagen university hospital in that s has deliberately used medication vinorelbine which is not approved for treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer and whose effect has not been substantiated that the medication in question was part of a test and that the test medication has resulted in patients dying or having their lives shortened the way that the programme is built up with its beginning and ending the viewers get the clear impression that the reasons behind this choice of medication vinorelbine were ss professional prestige and personal finances against this background in the programme the applicants as producer of the programme and as chief subeditor have made an allegation against copenhagen university hospital and s of malpractice and of nourishing irrelevant considerations to the detriment of the lives and health of patients such an accusation is likely to disparage copenhagen university hospital and s in the eyes of their fellow citizens as set out in article of the penal code it must have been clear to them the applicants that they were making such an allegation by way of their presentation of the programme the applicants have not attempted to establish the truth of the allegation but have submitted that the allegation shall be unpunishable by virtue of article of the penal code as they acted in lawful protection of an obvious public interest or the interest of others or in the alternative that punishment should be remitted under article of the penal code because they were justified in regarding the allegations as true these provisions must in connection with article of the penal code be understood in the light of article of the convention on the protection of freedom of expression a very considerable public interest is related to journalistic discussion about risk to life and health or suspicion thereof as regards public hospital treatment when balancing considerations of freedom of expression with considerations of the protection of the name and reputation of persons and companies the former is accorded tremendous weight on the scale that entails acknowledgement of a very farreaching freedom of expression for the press and accordingly the press must be permitted as the public control and information organ public watchdog a certain amount of exaggeration and provocation in connection with their discussion of these questions when factually there are reasons for expressing criticism on the basis of the information in the case including the research material that the applicants possessed before the broadcast of the programme in particular the emails from the medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany and the professor from switzerland the replies by the minister for internal affairs and health to various questions posed by members of parliament and the memorandum of june produced by copenhagen university hospital about pleural mesothelioma cancer it can be established that vinorelbine in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin was standard treatment at copenhagen university hospital that the european union on september approved the marketing of alimta in connection with cisplatin for treatment of inoperable patients with pleural mesothelioma cancer that there was no substantiation or basis for believing that an alimtabased treatment was more efficient than the treatment offered by copenhagen university hospital that some patients at copenhagen university hospital who were already about to receive vinorelbine as standard treatment were chosen and offered the same medicine as part of a test it is not known for what and that s did not make any private financial profit from these tests against this background including the fact that the word approved was not explained during the programme namely the difference between medication approved for treatment and medication approved for marketing and by consistently using the word test medication even though only one patient in the programme participated in tests the applicants made allegations which were based on an incorrect factual basis of which they must have been aware via the research material the aim of the programme to make a critical assessment of the treatment of patients with pleural mesothelioma cancer offered by copenhagen university hospital and the responsible consultant is a legitimate part of the presss role as public watchdog but it can not justify an allegation which is built on a factually incorrect basis and thus a wrong premise the applicants who did not limit themselves to referring to or disseminating statements by experts patients and relatives did not have any basis for making such serious allegations against copenhagen university hospital and s the allegations can not be justified on the grounds that copenhagen university hospital and s refused to participate in the programme against this background and since in relation to article there is no interest to protect when there is no factual basis for the accusations the allegations are not unpunishable under article nor is there any basis for remitting the punishment under article of the penal code it is an aggravating factor that the wrongful accusations were disseminated on national television during primetime and on drs homepage by means of which the accusations had a significant spread accordingly the high court agrees with the copenhagen city courts judgment that the applicants be fined under article and that the allegations be declared null and void by virtue of article the high court thus dismisses the appeal and upholds the judgment of the copenhagen city court the applicants shall be jointly and severally liable for paying legal costs of the high court appeal to copenhagen university hospital and s in the amount of dkk which constitutes the legal fee inclusive of vat in fixing the amount the high court took into account the scope and duration of the case on october the appeals permission board procesbevillingsnævnet refused the applicants request for leave to appeal to the supreme court højesteret b complaints lodged with the patient insurance association subsequent to the broadcast on september of the television programme four complaints were lodged with the patient insurance association patientforsikringen relating to the issues raised by the programme a press release published on the associations website on march read as follows as of today the patient insurance association has received four complaints relating to the treatment of mesothelioma patients with combinatorial drugs other than carboplatin and alimta that treatment was questioned by the danish broadcasting corporation dr in a documentary programme in september the patient insurance association has received four complaints relating to the criticism raised this means that the persons claiming compensation are either patients or their dependants one of the reasons being their belief that the combinatorial drugs administered to treat the disease were incorrect ones all four complaints have been refused one of the reasons being that the independent medical oncologists who assessed the cases found that it was in compliance with optimum medical standards to treat patients with the selected combination therapy two of the cases have been appealed against to the national agency for patients rights and complaints patientskadeankenævnet the national agency for patients rights and complaints upheld the decision of the patient insurance association finding inter alia patients were offered carboplatin and vinorelbine which must be considered to be as active as other combinations with a favourable profile of adverse reactions the other appeal does not concern the issue of combination therapy ii relevant domestic law the relevant provisions of the danish penal code applicable at the time read as follows article any person who tarnishes the honour of another by offensive words or conduct or by making or spreading allegations of an act likely to disparage him in the eyes of his fellow citizens shall be liable to a fine or to imprisonment not exceeding four months article if an allegation has been maliciously made or disseminated or if the author has no reasonable ground to regard it as true he shall be guilty of defamation and the punishment mentioned in article may increase to a term not exceeding two years article an allegation shall not be punishable if its truth has been established or if the author of the allegation has in good faith been under an obligation to speak or has acted in lawful protection of an obvious public interest or of the personal interest of himself or of others the punishment may be remitted where evidence is produced which justifies the grounds for regarding the allegations as true article the penalty prescribed in article of the penal code may be remitted if the act has been provoked by improper behaviour on the part of the injured person or if he is guilty of retaliation article if a defamatory allegation is unjustified a statement to that effect shall at the request of the injured party be included in the sentence any person convicted of defamation may be ordered at the request of the insulted person to pay to the insulted person an amount fixed by the court to cover the costs of promulgating the judgment conclusion alone or also the grounds in one or more official gazettes this also applies even if the judgment only provides for retraction under the provision of subsection the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicants complained that the judgment of the high court amounted to a disproportionate interference with their right to freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions the applicants recognised that their conviction was prescribed by law and that in respect of s it pursued a legitimate aim they submitted however that copenhagen university hospital could not in its capacity as a public body rely on the protection of the reputation or rights of others under article of the convention and referred in this respect inter alia to the dissenting opinion in romanenko and others v russia no october in the applicants opinion it would seriously harm democratic principles and legal certainty if the state were able to protect itself from public scrutiny by limiting the freedom of expression of a journalist where a public body is involved the judiciary is the only public authority whose protection is capable of constituting a legitimate aim within the meaning of article moreover they maintained that the interference constituted a breach of their rights as journalists as the interference was not necessary in a democratic society the main purpose of the programme was to perform a critical assessment of the treatment of mesothelioma at copenhagen university hospital compared to the treatment by other leading experts and to raise questions about whether patients should have been informed of other therapeutic options than vinorelbine it presented the patients and the families frustrations over being denied the choice of their preferred chemotherapy especially given the fact that alimta had undergone phase iii examination and thus was more thoroughly tested than vinorelbine the programme was not scientific and did not claim to give a scientific account of the advantages of one cancer treatment over the other the documentary was based on substantive and significant journalistic research carried out over a period of approximately one year it included international medical experts and a very broad range of open source material the applicants acted in good faith and in full compliance with press ethics when preparing and airing the programme both s and copenhagen university hospital were invited to comment on the allegations in the documentary on numerous occasions the memorandum of june produced by copenhagen university hospital was not suitable for inclusion in the documentary as it did not answer the specific questions asked by the applicants the subject matter that the patients and their families felt that they were not being properly informed and given the choice of which chemotherapy treatment they preferred at copenhagen university hospital was clearly of public interest and the documentary gave rise to a broad public debate the impact was significant and had various important consequences inter alia a public demand for alimta therapy and a change in practice at copenhagen university hospital all of which highlighted why this kind of journalism was essential and indispensable in a democratic society the domestic courts failed to carry out a careful balancing exercise between the right to impart information and protection of the reputation of others they gave a distorted picture of the content of the documentary and the responsibility of the journalist reporting what was being said by others the applicants noted for example that the charge against them did not relate to any specific statements in the documentary and that the domestic courts did not mention any specific statements by the applicants which were considered incorrect moreover the voiceovers provided in the programme should not be considered in isolation but in the context of the journalistic production as a whole with respect for the function of the documentary and of the documentary genre as a dissemination tool for statements of named third parties the high court performed a crucial change of the conclusions of the documentary by finding that the programme gave a defamatory impression that alimta was a superior product and that s had caused unnecessary death for his personal benefit this was clearly not stated in the documentary the judicial authorities placed a disproportionate and unfair burden on the applicants requiring under criminal law that they provide medical documentation about alimta compared to vinorelbine the wording of the high court judgment also indicated that there had been no specific assessment by the judges of the value of the documentary to general society finally the applicants submitted that the penalties imposed were disproportionate to the harm alleged and likely to deter journalists from performing their essential role as public watchdogs and keeping the public informed about matters of public interest they pointed out that they had received criminal convictions had had to pay fines and there had been the final punishment of paying costs to s and copenhagen university hospital the government maintained that the interference was prescribed by law and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation of others they referred to caselaw in which the court had presupposed that a public body could also fall within the protection of the reputation or rights of others for example romanenko and others v russia cited above lombardo and others v malta no and april and thorgeir thorgeirson v iceland june series a no they further contended that since it was recognised that the reputation of the police may be a legitimate aim the same should apply to several other public bodies the conditions at a public hospital constitute an issue of considerable public interest and entail a need for wider limits for public scrutiny but this is partly for other reasons than for a public body exercising power in the traditional sense public interest may therefore be deemed to be interconnected with the relevance of the activities of the hospital to the life and health of individuals allegations made on a factually incorrect basis will affect the patients confidence in the treatment offered and may weaken the possibilities of the hospital to function in an optimal manner in addition it would amount to unfounded arbitrariness in the protection of the health interests of the contracting states if they were to have the possibility of interfering with attacks on the reputation of private hospitals but not of public hospitals with respect to the proportionality test the government found it of vital importance that the case at hand did not concern dissemination of defamatory statements made by others it concerned defamatory statements independently worded and made by the applicants notably when they had used the voiceover to convey the impression to the viewers that improper treatment had been given and that this was ss deliberate choice motivated by his desire for professional esteem and his personal financial situation this should lead to a stricter assessment of the applicants defamatory statements when balanced against the protection of the reputation or rights of s and copenhagen university hospital the government also submitted that although the high court did not make an explicit classification of the allegations the wording of the reasoning clearly illustrated that it considered them to be allegations of facts at least those elements of the allegations that did not relate to ss motives referring to the high courts finding the government maintained that the applicants did not act on a factually correct basis nor did they provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the ethics of journalism when making their very serious allegations they did not act in good faith among other things they deliberately omitted to inform the viewers that according to the research material available to them the effect of vinorelbine had been documented and that there was no basis for stating that alimtabased chemotherapy was more effective than the vinorelbinebased treatment offered by copenhagen university hospital they also omitted to mention that copenhagen university hospital in a memorandum of june to the applicants had given a thorough account of the reasons for the medical product chosen and an explanation of the research which emphasised that the doctors involved did not themselves benefit financially furthermore as stated by the high court by not defining the term approved or the difference between a drug approved for treatment and a drug approved for marketing and by consistently using the term experimental drug the applicants made accusations resting on a factually incorrect basis of which they must be deemed to have become aware through the research material in the assessment of the nature and seriousness of the defamation the government found that great importance had to be attached to the fact that audiovisual media are very effective and that the allegations were made in a television programme by a national television company which is generally perceived as highly reliable the government fully recognised that the subject at issue was of considerable public interest for which reason a broader protection of the freedom of expression applies the aim could have been achieved however without making the impugned accusations they also pointed out that the high court found that it had not been substantiated that there was any medical difference between vinorelbine and alimta which was also the conclusion of the independent medical oncologist of the patient insurance association the changes of treatment regime at copenhagen university hospital caused by the programme thus illustrated that allegations made by the press on a factually incorrect basis may harm individuals confidence in the national health authorities finally they pointed out that the applicants had been given very mild sentences the courts assessmenta whether there was an interference prescribed by law it is common ground between the parties that the impugned judgment constituted an interference by a public authority with the applicants right to freedom of expression as guaranteed under the first paragraph of article and that it was prescribed by lawb whether it pursued a legitimate aim the applicants disputed that copenhagen university hospital being a public body could rely on the protection of the reputation or rights of others under article of the convention and referred in this respect inter alia to the dissenting opinion in romanenko and others v russia cited above the court reiterates that in thorgeir thorgeirson v iceland cited above concerning charges for defamation of an unspecified member of the police it was not disputed or questioned by the court that the applicants conviction and sentence were aimed at protecting the reputation of others and thus had a legitimate aim under article of the convention moreover in romanenko and others v russia cited above concerning a courts management department being a public body the court acknowledged that there may be sound policy reasons to decide that public bodies should not have standing to sue for defamation in their own capacity however it is not its task to examine the domestic legislation in the abstract but rather to consider the manner in which that legislation was applied to or affected the applicant in a particular case thereafter it went on to examine the issue in the analysis of the proportionality of the interference likewise in lombardo and others v malta cited above although stating that it is only in exceptional circumstances that a measure proscribing statements criticising the acts or omissions of an elected body such as a council can be justified with reference to the protection of the rights or reputations of others the court was prepared to assume that this aim can be relied on and went on to the proportionality test furthermore in kharlamov v russia no october concerning a universitys authority the court went on to consider the issue in the analysis of the proportionality of the interference it did state though ibid that the protection of the universitys authority is a mere institutional interest of the university that is a consideration not necessarily of the same strength as the protection of the reputation or rights of others within the meaning of article see uj v hungary no july the latter reference concerned a stateowned company in respect of which the court observed ibid the impugned criminal charges were pressed by a company which undisputedly has a right to defend itself against defamatory allegations in this context the court accepts that in addition to the public interest in open debate about business practices there is a competing interest in protecting the commercial success and viability of companies for the benefit of shareholders and employees but also for the wider economic good the state therefore enjoys a margin of appreciation as to the means it provides under domestic law to enable a company to challenge the truth and limit the damage of allegations which risk harming its reputation see steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii kuliś and różycki v poland no echr however there is a difference between the commercial reputational interests of a company and the reputation of an individual concerning his or her social status whereas the latter might have repercussions on ones dignity for the court interests of commercial reputation are devoid of that moral dimension in the instant application the reputational interest at stake is that of a stateowned corporation it is thus a commercial one without relevance to moral character having regard to the abovecited caselaw the court is not convinced by the applicants submission that the judiciary is the only public authority whose protection is capable of constituting a legitimate aim under article in the present case the high court found that the applicants as producer of the programme and as chief subeditor had made an allegation against copenhagen university hospital and s of malpractice and of nourishing irrelevant considerations to the detriment of the lives and health of patients and that such an accusation was likely to disparage copenhagen university hospital and s in the eyes of their fellow citizens as set out in article of the penal code see paragraph above the court notes in addition that the impugned allegations were strongly linked to s and his alleged motives for using the product vinorelbine on his patients suffering from mesothelioma the allegations were also found to be defamatory for copenhagen university hospital which in the courts view rather acted as the representative for its unnamed management and staff who were also concerned by the accusations in the programme than being a mere institution representing its interests in the form of prestige or commercial success the case thus appears comparable to the situation in thorgeir thorgeirson v iceland cited above in such circumstances the court can agree with the government that there is no basis in the notion of others set out in the second paragraph of article to distinguish between attacks on the reputation of medical staff at private hospitals as opposed to public hospitals having regard thereto and to the particular circumstances of case the court concludes that also in respect of copenhagen university hospital the applicants conviction and sentence were aimed at protecting the reputation of others and had a legitimate aim under article of the conventionc whether the interference was necessary in a democratic societyi general principles the principles concerning the question of whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are wellestablished in the courts caselaw see among other authorities delfi as v estonia gc no to echr with further references the court has to examine the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts in this context the court recalls that the interference aimed at protecting the reputation of an individual consultant s as well as a public body in its capacity of representing its unnamed staff the university hospital see paragraphs as regards in particular protection of the reputation of an individual the court has held that a persons reputation even if that person is being criticised in the context of a public debate forms part of his or her personal identity and psychological integrity and therefore falls within the scope of his or her private life in order for article to come into play though the attack on personal honour and reputation must attain a certain level of gravity and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see inter alia see delfi cited above axel springer ag v germany gc no february and a v norway no april having been required on numerous occasions to consider disputes requiring an examination of the fair balance to be struck between the right to respect for private life and the right to freedom of expression the court has developed general principles emerging from abundant caselaw in this area see among other authorities couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no to echr extracts the criteria which are relevant when balancing the right to freedom of expression against the right to respect for private life are inter alia the contribution to a debate of general interest how wellknown the person concerned is and what the subject of the report is his or her prior conduct the method of obtaining the information and its veracity the content form and consequences of the publication and the severity of the sanction imposed see for example satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no echr extracts axel springer ag v germany gc cited above and to february and von hannover v germany no gc nos and to echr finally the court reiterates that where the national authorities have weighed up the freedom of expression with the right to private life in compliance with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw strong reasons are required if it is to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see inter alia von hannover v germany no gc cited above axel springer ag v germany gc cited above lillo stenberg and sæther v norway no january and couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc cited above even though the interference aimed at protecting the reputation of the university hospital which is covered by reputation of others in article and consultant s who is not only covered by the same provision but who may also rely on the right to respect of private life as protected by article of the convention the court will proceed with assessing the proportionality of the interferences on the basis of the same criteria see paragraph above in relation to both the university hospital and consultant sii application of those principles to the present caseα the subject matter of the programme and its contribution to a debate of general interest the applicants maintained that the main purpose of the programme was to perform a critical assessment of the treatment of mesothelioma at copenhagen university hospital compared to treatment by other leading experts and to raise questions about whether patients should have been informed of other therapeutic options than vinorelbine it presented the patients and the families frustrations over being denied the choice of their preferred chemotherapy especially given the fact that alimta had undergone phase iii examination and thus had been more thoroughly tested than vinorelbine the programme was not scientific and did not claim to give a scientific account of the advantages of one cancer treatment over another it is evident from the judgments of the domestic courts though that the programme also raised the question of whether the applicants had made directly and indirectly allegations that s and copenhagen university hospital had given certain patients suffering from mesothelioma improper treatment resulting in their unnecessary death and the shortening of their lives in order to promote ss professional esteem and personal financial situation the domestic courts acknowledged that such a subject was of public interest in fact the high court pointed out in its judgment of june that the matter was an issue of very considerable public interest by stating the following a very considerable public interest is related to journalistic discussion about risk to life and health or suspicion thereof as regards public hospital treatment when balancing considerations of freedom of expression with considerations of the protection of the name and reputation of persons and companies the former is accorded tremendous weight on the scale that entails acknowledgement of a very farreaching freedom of expression for the press and accordingly the press must be permitted as the public control and information organ public watchdog a certain amount of exaggeration and provocation in connection with their discussion of these questions when factually there are reasons for expressing criticism the court agrees with the domestic courts that the programme dealt with issues of legitimate public interestβ how wellknown the person concerned is and his conduct prior to the programme in the present case the impugned criticism was directed at s and copenhagen university hospital being a public hospital including its unnamed management and staff who were also concerned by the accusations in the programme see paragraph above they were all vested with official functions the court reiterates in this respect that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider as concerns public figures than private individuals see for example couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc cited above to with further references the government also accepted that in the present case there was a need for wider limits for public scrutiny not because copenhagen university hospital could be compared to a public body exercising power in the traditional sense but rather because the activities of the hospital and its conditions had an impact on the life and health of individuals a similar view was expressed by the high court see paragraph above when pointing out that in respect of public hospital treatment when balancing considerations of freedom of expression with considerations of the protection of the name and reputation of persons and companies the former is accorded tremendous weight on the scaleγ content form and consequences of the impugned programme the domestic courts found that the applicants in the programme had made allegations that s and copenhagen university hospital had given certain patients suffering from mesothelioma improper treatment resulting in their unnecessary death and the shortening of their lives to promote the professional esteem and personal financial situation of s more precisely in its judgment of june the high court found after having seen the programme and by quoting various voiceovers that with these statements the applicants not only passed on assertions by patients relatives and experts but also took a stand so that the programme undisputedly gave the viewers the impression that malpractice has occurred at copenhagen university hospital in that s has deliberately used medication vinorelbine which is not approved for treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer and whose effect has not been substantiated that the medication in question was part of a test and that the test medication has resulted in patients dying or having their lives shortened the way that the programme is built up with its beginning and ending the viewers get the clear impression that the reasons behind this choice of medication vinorelbine were ss professional prestige and personal finances on this background in the programme the applicants as producer of the programme and as chief subeditor have made an allegation against copenhagen university hospital and s of malpractice and of nourishing irrelevant considerations to the detriment of the lives and health of patients such an accusation is likely to disparage copenhagen university hospital and s in the eyes of their fellow citizens as set out in article of the penal code it must have been clear to them the applicants that they made such an allegation by way of their presentation of the programme it further concluded that those accusations rested on a factually incorrect basis on the basis of the information in the case including the research material that the applicants possessed before the broadcast of the programme in particular the emails from the medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany and the professor from switzerland the replies by the minister for internal affairs and health to various questions posed by members of parliament and the memorandum of june produced by copenhagen university hospital about pleural mesothelioma cancer it can be established that vinorelbine in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin was standard treatment at copenhagen university hospital that the european union on september approved the marketing of alimta in connection with cisplatin for treatment of inoperable patients with pleural mesothelioma cancer that there was no substantiation or basis for believing that an alimtabased treatment was more efficient than the treatment offered by copenhagen university hospital that some patients at copenhagen university hospital who were already about to receive vinorelbine as standard treatment were chosen and offered the same medicine as part of a test it is not known for what and that s did not make any private financial profit from these tests against this background including the fact that the word approved was not explained during the programme namely the difference between medication approved for treatment and medication approved for marketing and by consistently using the word test medication even though only one patient in the programme participated in tests the applicants made allegations which were based on a wrong factual basis of which they must have been aware via the research material the court has no reason to call into question those conclusions reached by the high court the court is also satisfied that the accusations against s reached the level of seriousness required to fall within the scope of article of the convention see paragraph above the court reiterates that the potential impact of the medium of expression concerned is an important factor in the consideration of the proportionality of an interference and that the audiovisual media have a more immediate and powerful effect than the print media see for example jersild v denmark judgment of september series a no the high court found that it was an aggravating factor that the wrongful accusations were disseminated on national television during primetime and on drs homepage by means of which the accusations had a significant spread the court notes in addition that the programme was broadcast by one of the two national television stations in denmark and described as a documentary which could add to the viewers expectations that they would be presented with the truth the applicants maintained that the impact of their programme was significant and had various important consequences inter alia a public demand for alimta therapy and a change in practice at copenhagen university hospital all of which highlighted why this kind of journalism was essential and indispensable in a democratic society the court points out however that the domestic courts assessed the material before them which the applicants possessed and concluded that there was no documentation to show that alimta therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product was more effective than vinorelbine therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product nor was there substantiation or basis for believing that an alimtabased treatment was more efficient than the treatment offered by copenhagen university hospital the court has found no reason to call into question those conclusions it therefore also accepts that the reason why after the programme had been broadcast the public demand for alimta therapy may have increased and copenhagen university hospital changed its standard therapy for operable patients to cisplatin in combination with alimta was that the programme on an incorrect factual basis had encouraged patients to mistrust vinorelbine therapy as also stated by s and h before the city court the court further observes that before the city court h added that the programme had created distrust towards both copenhagen university hospital and s that it had created uncertainty in patients and relatives and that he himself had subsequently received to hate mailsδ method of obtaining the information and its veracity before the domestic courts the applicants maintained that they acted in good faith and in full compliance with press ethics when preparing and airing the programme and that the documentary was based on substantive and significant journalistic research carried out over a period of approximately one year it included international medical experts and a very broad range of open source material the first applicant also stated that s and copenhagen university hospital had been invited to comment on the allegations in the documentary on numerous occasions the applicants had received the memorandum of june see paragraph above about pleural mesothelioma cancer and its treatment produced by copenhagen university hospital which stressed that international studies including of vinorelbine and alimta had not shown that any twocombination regime was superior to other twocombination regimes that information was confirmed by the professor from switzerland in an email of june and by the medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany in an email of june see paragraph above the memorandum also referred to a fund aimed at developing research on pleural mesothelioma cancer in the amount of dkk received by s from company f and stated that the money had been used to pay nurses and students and for data collection it emerged that there had been no financial profit for the doctors involved the applicants stated that they did not find the memorandum suitable for inclusion in their documentary as it did not answer the specific questions asked by them the court notes that the domestic courts did not dispute that the applicants had conducted thorough research as stated above however based on the particulars of the case which included the research material which the applicants had possessed before the programme was broadcast they found that the applicants had made accusations resting on a factually incorrect basis of which they must be deemed to have become aware through the research material in conclusion the high court stated the aim of the programme to make a critical assessment of the treatment of patients with pleural mesothelioma cancer offered by copenhagen university hospital and the responsible consultant is a legitimate part of the presss role as public watchdog but it can not justify an allegation which is built on a factually wrong basis and thus a wrong premise the applicants who did not limit themselves to referring to or disseminating statements by experts patients and relatives did not have any basis for making such serious allegations against copenhagen university hospital and s again the court sees no reason to call into question the high courts conclusions it reiterates that the safeguard afforded by article to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the provision that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the ethics of journalism see for example bédat cited above it notes in particular that there is no indication that the judicial authorities placed a disproportionate and unfair burden on the applicants including as alleged by them requiring under criminal law that they provide medical documentation about alimta compared to vinorelbine finally the high court stated that the allegations made by the applicants could not be justified by the fact that copenhagen university hospital and s refused to participate in the programme the court notes in addition that it is not in dispute that copenhagen university hospital participated and cooperated during the preparation of the programme by replying to questions by the applicants and furnishing them with relevant information including the memorandum of june produced by s in this respect the court can not ignore the statement by h before the city court see paragraph above that it is quite usual for copenhagen university hospital to surrender material to the press and to answer questions but the questions of the first applicant were neverending copenhagen university hospital has spent about a manyear or about dkk on responding to inquiries from the first applicant and huge efforts were made to accommodate her requestsε severity of the sanction imposed the defamation proceedings brought by s and copenhagen university hospital against the applicants ended in an order declaring the allegations null and void a criminal conviction of the applicants and a sentence for each of them amounting to dayfines of dkk a total of dkk equal to approximately euros eur the court notes that a criminal conviction is a serious sanction having regard to the existence of other means of intervention and rebuttal particularly through civil remedies see for example perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extracts in the circumstances of the present case however the court does not find the conviction and the sentence excessive or to be of such a kind as to have a chilling effect on the exercise of media freedom see inter alia pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi with further references the applicants emphasised that they had also been punished by having to pay legal costs to s and copenhagen university hospital those costs amounted to dkk equal to approximately eur before the city court and dkk equal to approximately eur before the high court the court has found that the most careful scrutiny on the part of the court is called for when measures taken by a national authority are capable of discouraging the participation of the press in debates over matters of legitimate public concern see for example jersild v denmark cited above and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii in the present case however the court finds that the decision that the applicants pay legal costs does not appear unreasonable or disproportionate see by contrast mgn limited v the united kingdom no january ζ conclusion in the light of all the abovementioned considerations the court considers that the domestic courts and most recently the high court in its judgment of june balanced the right of freedom of expression with the right to respect for private life and took into account the criteria set out in the courts caselaw the reasons relied upon were both relevant and sufficient to show that the interference complained of was necessary in a democratic society and that the authorities of the respondent state acted within their margin of appreciation in striking a fair balance between the competing interests at stake the court therefore concludes that there has been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on december pursuant to rule and of the rules of court stanley

32,the first applicant franz olivier giesbert is the publication director of the magazine le point the second applicant hervé gattegno is a journalist with le point the third applicant is the company operating le point a background to the proceedings at issue the proceedings against the applicants which form the subject matter of the three applications are related to the events commonly referred to as the bettencourt affair mrs liliane bettencourt principal shareholder of the group loréal is one of the richest individuals in france from the late s she made numerous gifts to her friend b a writer and photographer totalling several hundred million euros in value in december mrs bettencourts daughter ms bettencourt meyers filed a criminal complaint against b for the offence of undue influence abus de faiblesse with the public prosecutor at the nanterre tribunal de grande instance a preliminary investigation was opened in that context numerous interviews were conducted in particular with individuals close to mrs bettencourt and searches were carried out in september b was taken into police custody without waiting for the outcome of the investigation ms bettencourt meyers brought a private prosecution against b in the nanterre criminal court on the same charge of undue influence she sought and obtained the inclusion in the case file of material and reports from the preliminary investigation in september the public prosecutors office decided to discontinue the proceedings based on ms bettencourt meyers original complaint the case initiated by the private prosecution was first set down for hearing on september then on december on that date it was decided to seek a medical assessment of mrs bettencourt and the hearing was deferred again to april for the subsequent criminal proceedings see paragraphs and below mrs bettencourt publicly announced that she was refusing to undergo the assessment ordered by the court she also filed submissions by way of voluntary intervention including in the alternative an application to join the proceedings as a civil party in the event that the prosecution was regarded as valid by the court she argued that the aim of her civilparty application was to persuade the court that her mental faculties were not diminished and that she had made her gifts to b with all due lucidity the developments in the case were widely reported in the press the offending articles in le point were thus published in that context b the offending articles the article of december on december the third applicant published with the second applicants byline a fourpage spread under the heading investigation into a very dear friend and with the subheading treasure did he take advantage of liliane bettencourt b denies it but the finger of suspicion points to him the article referred to various aspects of the case and in particular the very significant gifts made by the heir of loréal for a total of one billion euros to b the journalist wrote quoting the testimony of liliane bettencourts former accountant she too describes the psychological domination imposed on an elderly lady who is more fragile than she may like he also inserted a passage from the prosecution document which summed up the situation as follows taking advantage of his influence and liliane bettencourts weakness b persuaded her at a time when her health was declining to give him sums of money and assets going beyond tokens of friendship the article was full of comments between inverted commas presented as extracts from statements made to the investigators working under the public prosecutor it pointed out that the latter had discontinued the investigation in question among the quotations were explanations given by b when he was in police custody in september and it was claimed by the journalist that those explanations were often contradicted by the facts he swears that liliane bettencourt has acted towards him like a patron their first meeting goes back to the s but their friendship dates from a portrait he made of her in i was then sufficiently well off that i did not need financial assistance from mrs bettencourt he retorted to the investigators i already owned five apartments on rue servandoni paris th a large collection of paintings and had coownership of the brouzet estate a large estate in the gard together with copyright dues and a commission on the sale by dior of the perfume poison after verification this inventory seems to be somewhat overstated in actual fact it was through a series of cheques from the billionaire and the cancellation of astronomical debts to real estate companies owned by him that b has managed to build up his assets to the point of acquiring seven apartments in the welltodo neighbourhood of saint sulpice today the whole complex forms a quaint townhouse with swimming pool cctv cameras and secret passages between the bookshelves contradicted by the numbers and dates the photographer was forced to explain more humbly that mrs bettencourt wanted him to expand in order to install all his works and perhaps set up a museum but curiously his benefactor did not even mention such a project during her own hearing on may bs explanation she is a modest woman she will not say the things that are in the depth of her heart the police investigation also demonstrates the lavishness of his property in the gard mrs bettencourt did not contribute to its financing he claimed however the billionaires accountant testified that numerous cheques had been signed by her made out to contractors doing work on the estate for at least euros and as much as a cheque of million euros in december several employees testified that around the same time the old ladys health had deteriorated herein lies the gravamen of the whole case was the loréal heiress really aware of the extent of her generosity b declared that he had never seen the slightest impairment of her behaviour he even went as far as attributing to the octogenarian on record a remarkable intellectual agility moreover he willingly gave the police officer the names of other beneficiaries who had received lavish gifts but perhaps not for the same reasons he nevertheless conceded the rest of his defence is even more audacious if he is to be believed liliane bettencourt enriched him against his will insisting that he accept gifts which he tried to refuse i only knew about these gifts when signing for them at the notarys office he claimed in relation to the paintings she has given him when asked by the police whether the notary had expressed any reservation he replied no on the contrary the notary told me that the money came from mrs bettencourts income and that she was responsible enough to be in control of what she was doing here again the reality is rather less clear the notary in question was originally introduced to liliane bettencourt to deal with the photographers real estate acquisitions then he replaced the family notary and all documents relating to life insurance were transferred to his practice i no longer recall whether i knew him before he worked for mrs bettencourt said b in an embarrassed semiconfession several employees say he was behind her choice his protests that he was disinterested are also at odds with a number of findings especially this answer liliane bettencourt gave herself to the police asked if her protégé had ever refused her generosity she replied no when the investigators confronted him with this answer the photographer was forced to concede i have never refused gifts that have already been recorded in notarial acts thats a bit different in addition to these oddities there are two damning statements in the file those two statements are extracts from the testimony of the former director of loréal once responsible for the management of liliane bettencourts assets and her former accountant the first spoke of a hold over mrs bettencourt he had asked to be relieved of his duties because he testified i ran the risk of being complicit in the misdeeds of mr b by my tacit consent the second witness referred to pressure on the part of the photographer and testified that he was always asking for money in late her attention was drawn to the proposed assignment of a life insurance policy for an amount in excess of million euros i tried to reason with mrs bettencourt but she was no longer her old self recalled the accountant i then bumped into b in the house and said to him youve seen the state she is in you know she is very ill he replied never mind as long as she is not under deputyship she can still sign the article also contained comments made by mrs bettencourt on may in a box headed exclusive what liliane bettencourt told the police the journalist after quoting extracts from the statement showing that mrs bettencourt did not recall the agreements she had signed with b wrote that these memory lapses are clearly at odds with the picture that b would be painting of her to the same investigators in another box the journalist reported on the application for judicial protection filed by mrs bettencourts daughter and quoted an extract from the report of neurologist pa who had been asked by the public prosecutor to examine the billionaires medical records revealing a state of vulnerability related to a probable degenerative neurological condition which impaired her individual faculties the article stated that from this episode and many others the financial brigade investigators in a report of december had concluded that there was a series of sufficiently strong presumptions that the offence of undue influence had been committed by b and that the photographer for his part had denounced an odious attack on a worldfamous artist it ended thus the court will rule whether the fortune passed to him by liliane bettencourt was a windfall or a swindle either way its a masterstroke the article of february on february the third applicant published with the second applicants byline an article indicated on the full front cover of the magazine under the headline bettencourt affair how to gain one billion without any effort the subheadings announcing the article read the unbelievable story of a society photographer who made a fortune by seducing liliane bettencourt the richest woman in france and the accusations of madams employees a photomontage showing mrs bettencourt with her friend b also appeared on the cover the subject of the article which extended to eight pages was indicated as follows bettencourt affair has the richest woman in france been conned by the photographer b some of her former employees have said as much to the police le point reveals their testimony and the secrets of this incredible highsociety melodrama the article began as follows is it about money or sentiment a quarrel over an inheritance or a question of principle a settling of family scores or the most perfect scam all of these things put together perhaps and much more because the millions slip away by their hundreds in an atmosphere redolent of an agatha christie novel and a setting worthy of scott fitzgerald even the trial the inevitable epilogue will resemble a highsociety event on and april the court of nanterre will look into the incredible generosity for almost a decade of the richest woman in france towards the person she has made her favourite the photographer b the article continued as follows since the billionaires daughter has taken her case to the courts accusing her mothers protégé of the offence of undue influence ripples of disgust have been felt along the majestic avenues of neuilly and beyond the high society of paris in finance industry and politics concerned that it may one day be regretted that no one had seen anything or at least said anything for the investigation has revealed the existence of lavish gifts apparently totalling around billion euros could such riches pass unnoticed theres a disturbing detail the largest sums were assigned to b in the spring of and in the summer of at a time when liliane bettencourts health was declining sharply guru much testimony has come to light since then le point is exclusively publishing several extracts see the following pages housemaids nurses secretaries the chauffeur accountants all describe the hold that b had over the loreal heiress aged his own individual way of soliciting her generosity the equivocal aspects of his behaviour before the court the succession of these indignant employees will be reminiscent of the spectacle in the von bülow affair the trial of the libertine and cynical american aristocrat who was accused in the early s on rhode island of poisoning his wife so that he could take over her fortune but even that scenario would not be the worst for b convicted at first instance von bülow was nevertheless acquitted on appeal for the time being the photographer confronts the suspicions with sardonic contempt to make a work of ones life thats what matters he proclaimed in le monde describing the charges against him as pathetic rumours his benefactor an intelligent woman who knows how to choose men to take risks he told the police sweeping a little too quickly under the carpet the doubts about her state of health to be sure the heiress affirmed a year ago in le journal du dimanche that she was attached to b and that she had no time for gossip she has since shut herself away leaving her lawyers to speak in her place refusing any medical assessment and cutting short her appearances at receptions or ceremonies this silence has only served to reinforce the impression of a woman under influence in the middle of the article under the heading exclusive the women who accuse there were long extracts over three pages from statements of employees who worked at mrs bettencourts house accountant secretary chambermaid nurse that had been given during the preliminary investigation the following statements were highlighted in particular it was as if b had woven his web around mrs bettencourt he answered me as long as she is not under deputyship she can sign b takes advantage of madames weakness to benefit from her generosity after referring to remarks by b and by mrs bettencourt in the press the article added a number of statements paint a less idyllic picture under oath employees and servants mentioned pressing requests for money going as far as harassment harsh language and various schemes bordering on the sordid under an intermediate heading strategy the article then mentioned and partially quoted documents that had been discovered by the financial investigators at bs home in paris the article ended with a small insert indicating that b had refused to respond to le point preferring to reserve his answers for the judges c the proceedings brought against the applicants following the publication of the impugned articles the urgent proceedings brought by mrs bettencourt application no on february following the publication of february mrs bettencourt brought urgent proceedings against the applicants in the paris tribunal de grande instance claiming a manifestly unlawful nuisance under articles and of the code of civil procedure she asked the urgentapplications judge to find that the reproduction of procedural documents from the file of the preliminary investigation initiated by the nanterre public prosecutor breached section of the law of july on freedom of the press section which prohibited the publication of documents from a criminal case file before they had been read out in open court and article of the civil code guaranteeing the right to respect for private life she requested that a courtordered notice be published in le point on pain of a coercive fine and that the applicants be ordered to pay her by way of an advance compensation for her nonpecuniary damage on account of her portrayal as an individual with diminished intellectual faculties who had been duped the applicants disputed mrs bettencourts standing to bring the proceedings as prosecution in respect of the section offence could only be initiated by the public prosecutor under section of the same law on the merits they claimed that it was contradictory on the one hand to require journalists to establish the veracity of the information that they published and on the other to penalise them for substantiating their investigation in a decision of march the vice president of the paris tribunal de grande instance found that mrs bettencourt had standing in so far as she was arguing that the publication of the impugned documents had on the basis of that provision caused her personal damage the judge indicated that while section of the law reserved the prosecution of the section offence for the public prosecutor an individual who claimed to have sustained pecuniary or nonpecuniary damage as a result of a publication was entitled to act as a civil party in the proceedings or to bring a case before the urgentapplications judge under article of the code of civil procedure in order to seek the requisite protective or remedial measures to put an end to the unlawful nuisance resulting from such publication or to request a sum by way of an advance the judge explained it suffices for the publication of the documents prior to their reading in open court to have caused the person actual and direct damage regardless whether or not the person is a party to the proceedings in which the documents are to be presented he ordered the applicants jointly to pay an advance of euros eur and the same sum in procedural expenses under article of the code of civil procedure as to the application of section of the act the judge took the view that the statements by employees of mrs bettencourt paragraph above constituted procedural documents which were part of the preliminary investigation and that even though it had been discontinued those documents had been joined to the criminal proceedings now pending after their transmission had been sought and obtained by ms bettencourt meyers in support of her own private prosecution he added that those statements all helped the case for the prosecution as indicated on the magazines cover the accusations of madames employees and observed as follows the publication of long passages emanating from insiders helps to give the reported facts an appearance of authenticity and objectivity that the article does not seek to nuance but on the contrary to reinforce the reader is thus led to regard those facts as proven because they are presented through the prism of a journalists analysis which is bound to contain a degree of subjectivity or opinion for those reasons the alleged breach of section can not be combined with the breaches under article of the civil code presumption of innocence or article of the civil code private life or section of the law of july defamation proceedings nor can it result in redress on the basis of those separate legal provisions the judge concluded that the publication was capable of infringing the rights of mrs bettencourt as it portrayed her at a time when the nanterre criminal court had not yet begun to examine the criminal cases as a woman who was manipulated and weak a description that she categorically denied the judge further found that the applicants were not justified in relying on the provisions of article of the convention and the necessities of information in this connection he indicated that section sought mainly to preserve the independence and orderly conduct of the judicial process in addition to protecting the rights of the persons concerned particularly by guaranteeing the presumption of innocence he emphasised the limited and temporary nature of the restriction on freedom of expression as the legislation did not prevent analysis of or comments on procedural material or the publication of information gleaned from the proceedings themselves but only prohibited the reproduction of documents which were intended for public disclosure in the context of a judicial process surrounded by safeguards these safeguards include respect for defence rights and the principle of adversarial proceedings which could not be ensured by a prior isolated and partial media report the judge went on to explain as follows the impugned restriction can not be compared to the case of disclosure of professional secrets or of secrets from the preliminary or judicial investigation on account of the possession by a journalist of documents covered by secrecy and used in publications imparting information to the general public in so far as the journalist who is not bound by those secrets is required to possess such documents in order to justify the veracity of the facts reported or the seriousness of his investigation but also to use them in compliance with the applicable legislation all of the claims submitted by mrs bettencourt alleging a breach of her privacy were dismissed on the ground that such a breach had not been sufficiently established having regard to the general publics right to be informed and interest in being informed of current affairs or events in the general interest the claimant has not relied on any specific breaches of her private life which would go beyond the information that it is permitted to mention in connection with the criminal case before the court of nanterre as le point did not in particular provide details about any health problems she may have the applicants appealed they argued in particular that the procedural documents in question which had been included in the case file solely on the initiative of the claimant and not on that of the public prosecutor could not be regarded as carrying the degree of authority which justified by derogation to the principle of freedom of expression the prohibition imposed by section they further emphasised that neither mrs bettencourts right to a fair hearing nor any undermining of the authority or impartiality of the courts was at stake in a judgment of march the paris court of appeal upheld the decision of the court below in the main and raised the amount of the advance to eur in addition to charging eur for the costs of the appeal proceedings it confirmed that the witness statements clearly constituted procedural documents even though the preliminary investigation had been discontinued since they had been transmitted by the public prosecutor at the request of the civil party and thus formed an integral part of the criminal proceedings in the courts view the fact that they were transmitted at the request of the civil party and not on the initiative of the public prosecutor bore little relevance in this connection it concluded that the publication of long passages from those statements constituted a violation of section and thus an unlawful nuisance within the meaning of article of the code of civil procedure it added as follows the requirement for the journalist to verify his sources and to compare the various material available to him on a given subject in the context of a serious investigation before imparting information to the public does not mean reproducing verbatim the documents used for his investigation where as in the present case such publication is prohibited under press legislation of which he can not be unaware the court concluded that the applicants submission that section should be declared incompatible with article of the convention was unfounded it took the view that mrs bettencourt was entitled to claim nonpecuniary damage as she had been portrayed asa woman in a weak mental state being easy to manipulate and under the influence of b which the reader is all the more likely to regard as the truth as the observations are presented as emanating from individuals who have played a particular role making them privileged observers of her private life lastly the court of appeal confirmed that there had been no breach of mrs bettencourts privacy in the following terms the mere mention of mrs bettencourts mental health in the body of the article without any details falling within her private sphere and in the testimony reproduced which was mainly about the conduct and manoeuvres attributed to b does not suffice to establish any particular breach of the respondents privacy that would go beyond the limits of legitimate information that the public is entitled to expect about a case which already being widely covered by the media is before the courts the applicants appealed on points of law in their grounds of appeal they argued under article of the convention that they had a duty to inform the public about a case pending before the courts which had been revived after a private prosecution following its discontinuance by the public prosecutor and which had given rise to wide media coverage especially on account of the personality and wealth of mrs bettencourt that the judgment of the court of appeal had found against them solely for publishing the statement extracts and not on account of their content that there had been no impairment of the interests protected by section because mrs bettencourt was not the defendant in the proceedings that there was a manifest contradiction in the court of appeals position as it had declared mrs bettencourts action admissible on the basis of the damage sustained while taking the view that she had not been portrayed as a weak and manipulated woman in terms of her right to respect for her private life in a judgment of april the court of cassation dismissed the applicants appeal and ordered them to pay mrs bettencourt the sum of eur in costs it gave the following reasons for its decision the judgment observes that long extracts were published from the statements taken during the preliminary investigation in which mrs bettencourt was portrayed as a manipulated and weak woman proceeding with a correct application of article of the convention the court of appeal was able without contradicting itself to conclude from that publication since the documents drawn up by the police during an investigation are procedural documents within the meaning of section of the law of july that mrs bettencourt was justified in claiming solely on the basis of that publication that she had sustained personal damage urgent proceedings brought by b application no on february b brought urgent proceedings against the applicants in the paris tribunal de grande instance following the publication of february arguing that it had caused him a manifestly unlawful nuisance infringing both his copyright to the photographs illustrating the article and his defence rights including his right to be presumed innocent in a decision of march the vice president of the paris tribunal de grande instance in addition to endorsing the reasoning already set out in paragraphs and above took the view that the impugned publication could have the alleged effects infringing bs right to a fair hearing and his right to the presumption of innocence bs claim concerning the infringement allegedly caused by the reproduction of photographs was rejected as falling outside the remit of the urgent proceedings judge the judge ordered the publication of a notice inside the magazine together with an indication of it on the cover to take up one half of the page in bold type under the heading judgment against le point in proceedings brought by b and on the weekly magazines website the applicants were also ordered jointly to pay b an advance of eur on compensation for his nonpecuniary damage together with an equivalent sum by way of procedural expenses the applicants appealed in a judgment of march the paris court of appeal upheld the decision appealed against mainly in the same terms as those set out in paragraph above it reiterated that the witness statements without engaging in any extensive interpretation of section could be characterised as procedural documents even though the investigation had been discontinued the fact that they were transmitted at the request of the private prosecutor and not on the initiative of the public prosecutor is of little relevance in this connection because they support the prosecution case it went on to find that consequently the mere publication of substantial extracts from those statements before they had been referred to or read out in open court had indeed constituted a violation of section of the law of july and therefore an unlawful nuisance the court of appeal further found as follows the four statements thus presented to the public portray b as a devious and unscrupulous individual using seduction manoeuvres and psychological pressure to persuade liliane bettencourt to grant him substantial and frequent gifts at a time when she was weak and when her husbands state of health had declined the reader is all the more likely to consider these statements to be true supporting as they do the accusation against b before the nanterre criminal court as they are presented as emanating from individuals who as a result of the services they rendered to her nurse chambermaid secretary played a particular role through which they became privileged observers of her private life the reader is thus led to believe in the accusation even before the court hearing the case has been able to reach its decision in conditions that breach the respondents right to be presumed innocent and his defence rights the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law in a judgment of july the court of cassation dismissed their appeal in the same terms as those of its judgment of april see paragraph above proceedings on the merits brought by b application no on march b brought proceedings against the applicants on the merits before the paris tribunal de grande instance seeking redress for the damage sustained on account of the publication of the articles of december and february in breach of section of the act in a judgment of june that court dismissed all of bs claims on the admissibility of his suit it observed that the applicants were correct to assert that an individual who claimed to be the victim of the offence provided for under section of the act was not authorised to bring a private prosecution on that basis it pointed out that by contrast the provisions of that act did not preclude the injured party from bringing proceedings in the civil courts as only one section of that act section prohibited the bringing of civil proceedings separately from a public prosecution namely in cases of defamation against public authorities state institutions and civil servants after observing that section usefully contributed to preserving the orderly functioning and impartiality of the justice system and to guarantee due process since the full and verbatim publication of documents from a criminal file before the trial could hinder the conduct of pending investigations or influence individuals who might subsequently be called upon to testify or even lay magistrates who might have to adjudicate upon the case the court gave the following reasons for its decision the prohibition that it establishes must not however restrict the ability of journalists to report on criminal cases even those which have not yet been publicly examined by a court and specifically those which raising issues of general interest involving significant interests or concerning people with highlevel responsibilities especially in political economic or artistic fields particularly deserve to be brought to public attention the application of this legislation can not in particular have the effect of precluding journalists from imparting to their readers in such a case all or part of the documentary resources from which they derived their information in order to establish its credibility or which substantiate their commentary and analysis in order to submit them for open discussion this is the case here extracts from reports which have been drawn up by the police acting on the instructions of the public prosecutor and which have been appended after the discontinuance of the proceedings for which they were produced to the file of further proceedings brought directly by a civil party in a criminal court those extracts therefore were included by the second applicant in two successive articles which were each the result of a journalistic investigation and sought to present readers with information analysis and comments on a criminal case that would soon be adjudicated upon by a court that involved considerable financial interests and concerned one of the richest individuals in france and a photographer and writer who has as he himself boasts undeniable success and notoriety in the first of the impugned texts short quotations from procedural documents which are reproduced in quotation marks in the body of the article and are therefore fully integrated into the journalists writing mention certain facts and offer an analysis thereof in the second text the three pages of extracts from procedural documents are included in a broader editorial presentation consisting essentially of a fourpage spread and a large photograph of the person concerned from which they are indissociable the journalist expressly refers to those extracts in his article analysing them and basing his conclusions on them if one were to accept in those circumstances that these two bodies of text should be examined by this court only on the basis of the strictliability offence under section of the freedom of the press act that would lead as the respondents rightly argue to preventing them from initiating the debate that is warranted by the journalists work within which the impugned extracts are merely one element and they would be deprived in the present case of the defences made available by law to persons who are prosecuted for defamation or for a breach of the right to be presumed innocent in other words precluding them from proving the veracity of the allegations or at least the journalists good faith and from submitting argument to the effect that the impugned texts do not contain any final conclusions expressing a biased view that the person in question is definitely guilty it should be noted in this connection that the claimant directs his main criticism in his writ of summons against the comments and analyses that the journalist has been led to write under his own name by the procedural documents cited and that he mainly reproduces in that writ only those comments and not the quotations that he is supposed to be challenging it should be observed in particular that the claimant complains that the statements from which extracts were quoted or in reality the journalists analysis thereof breached his right to be presumed innocent and were presented as damning and particularly incriminating it can be concluded that b himself admits that absent his chosen basis of action he had other options at his disposal a private prosecution or civil proceedings for defamation or a civil action for a breach of his right to be presumed innocent both of those courses of action would have entailed fair proceedings ensuring respect for the equality of arms and he was not therefore deprived of his right to have access to a court in order to secure respect for his rights in those circumstances the upholding in the present case of the claims that he has submitted under would constitute a restriction of freedom of expression devoid of any necessity in a democratic society in a judgment of february the paris court of appeal overturned that judgment it found that the impugned publications infringed bs right to a fair trial with respect for his defence rights including the right to be presumed innocent and breached section of the act it ordered the applicants jointly to pay b the sum of eur for each publication by way of compensation and eur in expenses under article of the code of civil procedure it also ordered the publication on pain of a coercive fine of a notice containing the operative provisions of the judgment in le point and on the magazines website the court of appeal explained that the assessment of the offending publication clearly went beyond the framework of that of socalled procedural offences and that it would have to be carried out with regard to article of the convention and to the question whether the interference with the applicants freedom of expression was necessary to protect the reputation or rights of others and to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary as regards the article of december the court noted that it had been published the day before bs appearance in the criminal court and that it clearly suggested that he was guilty as he was portrayed as an individual against whom there was a series of sufficiently strong presumptions that he had committed the offence of undue influence it took the view that the court below had wrongly regarded the aim of informing the public as prevailing over the means used namely illegal methods whereby extracts had been selected from statements collected in an investigation in order to show that b had committed the offence of undue influence whereas there had been no judicial decision to that effect it could be understood by the reader that b was not telling the truth about mrs bettencourts mental health and that his guilt was doubly suggested in the introduction citing an extract from the prosecution document which fell under section and in the conclusion it added as follows the reasoning given by the court below is tantamount to legitimising the practice which is legally prohibited of publishing extracts from an investigation file before they are read out in open court first on account of the interest of the subject and secondly while noting bs claim that his right to be presumed innocent was breached the court can not agree with the reasoning of the court below the article of december in so far as it portrays b as having committed the offence of undue influence visàvis mrs bettencourt in the abovementioned context clearly breaches his right to a fair trial including to the presumption of innocence that breach according to the article is exclusively based on the publication of extracts from statements which legally speaking are not addressed to journalists when they are not parties to the proceedings the court would reiterate that for a reader who has an average knowledge of the courts documents from judicial investigations take on particular credibility and an undeniable evidential value the court reaches the conclusion that the date of publication the choices of quotation and the portrayal of b as guilty according to the documents from the judicial investigation even though it had been discontinued had the consequence of influencing his exercise which was legally and conventionally guaranteed of his defence rights which meant that before being heard by a court he should not have been portrayed as guilty of the offence of undue influence against mrs bettencourt b thus finds himself required to give explanations on evidence against him which has not yet been debated in a court of law and which has been taken from an investigation then still secret conducted under the supervision of a judge it is not befitting to consider as did the court below that b had other courses of action available to him being entitled to bring his case to the civil court under section it can not be suggested to the claimant that he should have opted for other types of proceedings on the erroneous ground that his action contravenes article of the convention as regards the article of february the court of appeal took the view that the editorial choices front cover of the magazine presentation of whole swathes of statements highlighting of the exclusive publication of the witness statements constituted a communication of some importance directly aimed at b who had not been able to explain before a court his position on the accusations of the staff it added that the publication portrayed b as being accused by third parties in conclusive terms and that the article was a repeated incrimination of b two months before a hearing at which the epilogue of the case was supposed to take place the applicants appealed on points of law in their grounds of appeal they argued in particular that the ban on publishing procedural documents was a matter of defence of the general interest falling within the sole jurisdiction of the public prosecutor and that a private person could not seek redress for damage on that basis they added that their argument was supported by the fact that b could have under article of the civil code used another legal remedy to ensure the protection of his interests and that the interference with freedom of expression and of information had therefore not been justified or proportionate in a judgment of may giving the following reasons the court of cassation dismissed the applicants appeal having found first that the article of december was based on an analysis of extracts from various statements taken by the criminal investigation police in order to portray b as having taken advantage of mrs bettencourts weakness the day before his appearance before a criminal court which was to rule on the relevance and merits of the accusations made against him by her daughter and secondly that the article of february based on a partial reproduction of statements taken by the criminal investigation police seeking to portray b as being accused by third parties in conclusive terms in order to lead the reader to believe that the case against him was made out two months before a hearing which would constitute according to the article the epilogue of the case the court of appeal reached the conclusion that the publication had infringed bs right to a fair trial with due respect for his right to be presumed innocent and his defence rights d developments in the bettencourt affair since the publication of the offending articles after june there were many developments in the case with its various political and financial repercussions and they were widely reported in the media on november the court of cassation ordered the transfer of all the aspects of the bettencourt case to the bordeaux tribunal de grande instance mrs bettencourts daughter withdrew her claims but the criminal proceedings were later resumed and on december b was placed under judicial investigation for the offence of undue influence in a judgment of may b was found guilty of that offence and sentenced to three years imprisonment of which six months were suspended a fine of eur and the payment of eur million in damages awarded to mrs bettencourt in a judgment of august the bordeaux court of appeal upheld the judgment in respect of the prosecution case and varied the sentence giving b a fouryear suspended prison sentence fining him eur and ordering the confiscation of part of his property the court of appeal also took the view that it did not need to make an award of damages on account of settlements that had been agreed between the parties iii relevant european instruments the court refers to recommendation rec of the council of europes committee of ministers to the member states on the provision of information through the media in relation to criminal proceedings adopted by the committee of ministers on july see bédat v switzerland gc no echr the lawii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicants alleged that the civillaw sanctions imposed on them under section of the act had entailed a violation of article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary b merits the parties submissionsa the applicants the applicants acknowledged that the sanctions imposed on them were based on legislation namely section of the act but they argued first that this provision was not sufficiently foreseeable as regards its wording they claimed that the notions of document from a criminal case file and read out in open court were not clear moreover it would be impossible for a journalist to know what would be possible or impossible to reproduce or how many lines he could publish from a document in the criminal case file without being regarded as breaching the highly formal statutory prohibition in the applicants view it was unquestionable that the relatively brief quotation of statements in press articles on judicial proceedings was something extremely common and that this situation did not usually entail prosecution they pointed out that journalists were justified in giving credibility to information that they imparted to the public paradoxically section obliged them to distance themselves from the strict reality of the judicial proceedings on which they were reporting the applicants alleged that the impugned ban was general formal and unforeseeable the fact that b had preferred to rely on section which was a little used remedy could be explained by a preference for legislation which would be applied almost automatically in their view this provision had enabled b and mrs bettencourt to obtain the judgment against them quite easily whereas proceedings under articles and of the civil code protecting private life and the presumption of innocence or a defamation suit in bs case would have failed mrs bettencourt had indeed been unsuccessful in her action under article of the civil code their legal actions had thus sought to circumvent any debate on the legitimacy of the information the reality of the facts mentioned in the impugned documents the quality of the journalists investigative work or the way in which the article had really been drafted as a whole the applicants emphasised that they had not sought to hide the context of the case that they had taken precautions in order to include the claimants denials and that the readers had been in a position to assess the scope and meaning of the statements in question it had also been pointed out that b was refusing to speak to le point the applicants further argued that the proceedings brought by b illustrated that unforeseeability two separate benches of the division specialising in media law in the urgent proceedings and on the merits had reached diametrically opposite conclusions on the same publication secondly the applicants took the view that the domestic courts had not convincingly defined the legitimate aim pursued on the one hand mrs bettencourts right not to be portrayed as a manipulated and weak woman was vague and her state of health was the central subject of the case but this had not been taken into account on the other the right of b to be presumed innocent had not been breached because otherwise he would have brought proceedings under article of the civil code lastly they claimed that section did not serve to protect the authority of the courts and their acts or the impartiality of the justice system because the right of mrs bettencourt and of b to a fair hearing was not at issue they had access to the case file and to the same documents with all the procedural safeguards provided for by law the applicants argued that the french legislature had sought primarily to preserve the independence of lay juries by enacting section of the press act in the present case by contrast the trial court was made up of professional judges who moreover were going to rule on claims submitted by a private prosecutor thirdly the applicants argued that the judgment against them had been neither necessary in a democratic society nor proportionate in the light of the demands of information about a highprofile case with reference to further developments in the case in particular its transfer to another region see paragraph above and producing a representative sample of what had been publicly disseminated the applicants spoke of hundreds or even thousands of articles and took the view that the case was a perfect example of the role of the press as watchdog of democracy in their submission the public debate at that level did not leave much room for restrictions on freedom of expression they pointed out in this connection that the present applications were different from those in tourancheau and july v france no november which had concerned an article on a banal criminal case before an assize court concerning parties unknown to the public the applicants lastly observed that the press had a duty to report on pending court cases with supporting evidence and documents without having to wait for a judicial outcome which might take several more years in this case seven years to wait that long would not have been compatible with the necessities of information in the bettencourt affairb the government the government argued that the interference was prescribed by law section of the act was an integral part of the published and accessible legislation moreover caselaw had established that the impugned prohibition applied to all documents from criminal case files and had set its scope which included extracts from such documents they cited tourancheau and july cited above lastly the domestic courts had examined the relevant publications in the light of article of the convention see paragraph above in the present case they pointed out that the published documents were reports drawn up by investigators during a preliminary criminal investigation the discontinuance of which was of little import and that the applicants had been aware of their origin they explained that the ban on the publication of documents before being read out in open court was clearly referring to the hearing during which the parties would be able to express their views on the content of those documents in a public hearing before a court of law the government noted in this connection that the impugned articles had themselves made reference to the forthcoming criminal court hearings lastly the difference in solution between the decision of the urgent applications judge on march and that of the tribunal de grande instance on june could not be interpreted as a demonstration of the unforeseeability of the law a decision in urgent proceedings did not by any means prejudge the solution to be decided on the merits on the one hand and the use of remedies had enabled a uniform interpretation of section in accordance with the courts caselaw on the other the government concluded that the interference had been prescribed by law after stating that in any event the applicants were wellinformed professionals who were familiar with the caselaw and had access if necessary to appropriate legal advice the government further observed that the interference had pursued the aim of the protection of the rights of others namely mrs bettencourts right to a fair hearing as the published testimony portrayed her as a woman easy to manipulate when she had filed a voluntary intervention with the court see paragraph above and the protection of bs defence rights and right to be presumed innocent it had further sought to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary as the impugned articles had been capable of influencing the criminal court they pointed out that regardless of its composition whether professional judges or lay jurors the court dealing with a case had to appear impartial for the person called upon to provide explanations on the facts in question that was not the case where a prejudgment on the facts had already been formed in public opinion and in the press as to the necessity of the impugned interference the government observed that on the date of publication of the first article the court was supposed to be ruling the next day on the admissibility of the relevant case whilst at the time when the second article was published it had still not examined the case on the merits they took the view that the domestic courts had fully analysed the content of the articles the choice of presentation and the substance of the statements together with the context of their publication before finding that there had been a breach first of mrs bettencourts right to a fair hearing and second of bs right to be presumed innocent after noting the slanted nature of the presentation of the statements obviously directed in favour of the prosecution case the courts had taken particular consideration of the fact that readers were likely to believe the reported facts to be true on account of the special credibility attached to documents from criminal proceedings and the highlighting of the testimony and identity of the witnesses in the governments view the grounds given by the domestic courts in the three cases thus appeared relevant and sufficient unlike the applicants the government took the view that the choice of the course of action namely section rather than article of the civil code had been pertinent in the present case they explained that the interests protected by the former provision were not limited to respect for the presumption of innocence and that in the present case the right to a fair hearing defence rights and respect for the authority and orderly functioning of the judicial system were also at issue the government emphasised in that connection that it was the very publication of the statements which through their presentation had breached the right of mrs bettencourt and of b to a fair hearing and to the impartiality of the courts they thus took the view that the application of section had been necessary and that the applicants could not complain that the domestic courts had found against them on that basis because the aim of that provision was not to penalise acts of defamation in the governments submission the interest of the published information had to be assessed at the date of its publication the prohibition of that publication remained valid for as long as the procedural documents concerned had not been examined in open court and its duration was strictly proportionate to the aims pursued it therefore did not matter that the parties had not ultimately been heard in court that the case had been relocated that mrs bettencourts daughter had withdrawn her claims or that the reading of the statements in open court had never taken place the government emphasised that the domestic courts had fully assessed both the implications and the imperatives inherent in freedom of expression in that context in the present case the permissible limits of reporting had been exceeded the impugned articles had been manifestly directed in favour of the prosecution case leading the reader to believe that the facts in the published statements were true at a time when mrs bettencourt and b had not yet been heard by a judge in addition to the damage caused to those individuals the publications had not therefore satisfied the obligation of the press to inform the public objectively moreover the accusations of undue influence made against b had not raised a question of general interest of which the public had to be informed it was just a banal news story the facts bore no relation to the management of the loréal group and therefore had no implications for the general public the government lastly argued that the pecuniary penalties imposed could not be regarded as excessive or as capable of having a chilling effect on the exercise of media freedom the courts assessment in the present case the impugned decisions against the applicants could clearly be seen as an interference with their right to freedom of expression and this was not in dispute between the parties such interference will breach the convention if it fails to satisfy the criteria set out in the second paragraph of article the court must therefore determine whether it was prescribed by law whether it pursued one or more of the legitimate aims listed in that paragraph and whether it was necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve that aim or aimsa whether the interference was prescribed by law as the court has already found many times in its judgments the expressions prescribed by law and in accordance with the law in articles to of the convention not only require that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law but also refer to the quality of the law in question the law should be accessible to the persons concerned and formulated with sufficient precision to enable them to foresee to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances the consequences which a given action may entail see among many other authorities fernández martínez v spain gc no echr in addition a law may still satisfy the requirement of foreseeability even if the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances the consequences which a given action may entail this is particularly true in relation to persons carrying out a professional activity who are used to having to proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation see tourancheau and july cited above in the present case the parties disagree as to whether section is sufficiently foreseeable the court has previously found that these provisions are foreseeable as required by article of the convention and does not see any reason to depart from that analysis it would refer to its judgment in tourancheau and july on this point cited above and in addition the first two applicants are wellinformed media professionals and they were in a position to assess the risk that they incurred when they published the articles ibid lastly as indicated by the government the difference in assessment between that of an urgent proceedings judge and that of a court ruling on the merits which did not have the same function did not demonstrate that the judicial decisions were unforeseeable or contradictory in conclusion the applicants could not argue that they had been unable to foresee to a reasonable degree the consequences that the impugned publications might have for them judicially the court concludes that the interference was prescribed by law within the meaning of the second paragraph of article of the conventionb whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim the court observes that the parties disagree as to the legitimate aims pursued by this interference which according to the applicants were not clearly defined they claimed that the damage to mrs bettencourts rights was not precisely defined that bs right to the presumption of innocence was not at issue as the case had not been brought under article of the civil code and that the aim of protecting the orderly functioning of the justice system was not realistic in relation to a bench of professional judges the court takes the view that the applicants arguments are to be addressed in an assessment of the necessity of the interference and are not such as to call into question the legitimate aims it notes in this connection that the national courts contended that section sought to preserve the independence and orderly functioning of the justice system as well as protecting the rights of the individuals concerned in particular by upholding the principle of the presumption of innocence see paragraphs and above it agrees with the government that the interference in question sought in respect of b to protect his right to a fair hearing with due respect for the presumption of innocence as to mrs bettencourt who admittedly was not the accused in the proceedings the court notes that denying that she was the weak and manipulated woman portrayed by the impugned article she had filed submissions to be joined as a civil party in the proceedings before the criminal court whose task it had been to assess her degree of awareness at the time when she had granted her gifts to b the purpose of the interference therefore as far as she is concerned was to protect her rights while guaranteeing the proper administration of justice in order to avoid any external influence on the judicial proceedings those aims correspond to the protection of the reputation and rights of others and the maintaining of the authority and impartiality of the judiciary in so far as the latter expression has been interpreted as encompassing the rights enjoyed by individuals as litigants in general see tourancheau and july cited above c whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society in the bédat judgment cited above the court laid down criteria to guide the national authorities of the states parties to the convention when weighing in the balance the article rights on the one hand and the public and private interests protected by the secrecy of the judicial investigation on the other even though the applicants were not charged with breaching the secrecy of the judicial investigation a charge which can not be brought against french journalists or with the offence of knowingly deriving an advantage from a breach of that secrecy see ressiot and others v france nos and and june the court takes the view that the criteria set out in the bédat judgment are applicable mutatis mutandis to the present case since the complaints submitted by the applicants on whom sanctions were imposed for the publication of documents from criminal proceedings before they had been read out in open court raise similar questions relating to the competing rights under articles and of the convention those criteria are as follows how the applicants came into possession of the information at issue the content of the impugned article the contribution of the article to a publicinterest debate the articles influence on the criminal proceedings any breach of the defendants privacy and the proportionality of the sanction imposedi how the applicants came into possession of the information the court notes as to the question of how the impugned procedural documents came to the applicants knowledge and reiterating that this is not necessarily a determining factor in assessing whether or not a journalist complied with his duties and responsibilities when publishing the information see bédat cited above that it has not been alleged that they obtained the documents illegally or fraudulently however the applicants could not have been unaware of the origin of the documents or of the confidential nature of the information that they were going to publish section does not penalise or cover the conditions in which a document from a case file has been obtained merely the publication of such a document that being said the applicants must have known that the verbatim publication of parts of those documents would run counter to the prohibition in the relevant legislationii the content of the impugned articlesα the article of december reiterating that article covers in addition to the substance of the ideas and information expressed possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation see bédat cited above and cases cited therein the court notes that the assessment of the content of the impugned article was not the same at first instance and on appeal for the court below the choice of the publication namely short quotations from statements incorporated into the journalists analysis and the media coverage of the case justified the refusal to uphold bs claims under section as that provision could not prevent journalists from reporting on criminal cases raising questions of general interest see paragraph above the court of appeal took the view that the impugned article had portrayed b as guilty of the offence of undue influence see paragraph above as confirmed by the court of cassation see paragraph above the court for its part observes that while the journalist remained prudent not setting out any explicit conclusion in the article of december the entire content of that article sought to show that b was guilty this is evident from the subheading of the publication did he take advantage of liliane bettencourt b denies it but the finger of suspicion points to him but also in the slanted comments from the selected passages of the prosecution document the extracts from bs statements in police custody and witness statements together with the report of the financial brigade which expressed the view that there was a series of sufficiently strong presumptions that the offence of undue influence had been committed by b the article used quotations repeatedly to highlight the contradictions and weaknesses in bs positions and conveyed information to the public in a biased manner through the choice of expressions such as here again the reality is rather less clear an embarrassed semiconfession or two damning statementsβ the article of february visàvis mrs bettencourt and b the court notes that the urgent proceedings judge examined the content of the article and concluded that mrs bettencourt was portrayed therein even though she firmly denied it as a manipulated and weak woman with diminished mental faculties the court does not see any serious reason to call into question the decision of the national courts as regards the content of the article it certainly suggests that mrs bettencourt in a diminished mental state was manipulated by b as to b the court finds that the domestic courts both the urgent proceedings judge and the trial court took the view that the article was not neutral or nuanced but rather slanted towards a demonstration of his guilt in breach of his right to be presumed innocent see paragraphs and above the court notes that under the headline exclusive the women who accuse the article consists of three pages exclusively made up of extracts from statements that are unfavourable to b emanating from former employees of mrs bettencourtγ conclusion as regards the content of the impugned articles the court does not see any reason to substitute its own opinion for that of the court of appeal and the court of cassationiii contribution of the impugned articles to a publicinterest debate in the present case the court can not agree with the governments submission that the impugned articles represented no more than the publication of a banal news story without making any contribution to a debate in the general interest see paragraph above the articles in le point were published in the context of proceedings which had begun in and had received wide media coverage as pointed out by the tribunal de grande instance the proceedings implicated public figures whose renown in the social and political arena was well established and the bettencourt affair already had a high profile in public opinion at the time of the publication see paragraph above moreover reiterating that the public have a legitimate interest in the provision and availability of information about criminal proceedings and that remarks concerning the functioning of the judiciary relate to a matter of public interest see morice v france gc no april and bédat cited above see also recommendation rec cited above paragraph above the court observes on this point that the publics interest in being informed about this case goes well beyond the context of the family conflict between mrs bettencourt and her daughter or the relations between the latter and b the court therefore finds that the applicants offending remarks which concerned public figures and the functioning of the judiciary were part of a debate in the general interest which went beyond satisfying the mere curiosity of a certain readership about an event or trial involving unknown parties compare bédat cited above and and tourancheau and july cited above see also mutatis mutandis du roy and malaurie v france no echr x and dupuis and others v france no june the publics interest in receiving information went beyond the context of the trial and that fact had to be taken into account when weighing in the balance the various interests involved the court observes that the firstinstance court in the proceedings on the merits took the view that the content of the articles of december and february constituted information that could contribute to a debate in the general interest as it was a criminal case with considerable financial repercussions and concerned public figures the other domestic courts ruling on the merits and in urgent proceedings did not deny that the information in the impugned publications was such as to contribute to a generalinterest debate they took the view however that this debate having regard to the provisions of section of the act could be informed otherwise than by quoting from procedural documents to which the reader would attach particular credibility and an undeniable evidential value in the courts view the weighing in the balance of on the one hand the interests of mrs bettencourt and b together with those of the proper administration of justice and on the other the alleged general interest justification relied upon by the applicants could have given rise to more explicit reasoning in the same way that the alleged breach of the right to private life was itself dealt with see paragraphs and above that being said the court can not infer from the decisions in question that the national courts failed to take into consideration the fact that the publications were capable of providing clarification for the benefit of the public debate and the public interest their dismissal of this aspect as insufficiently pertinent fell within their margin of appreciation see bédat cited above iv the influence of the impugned articles on the criminal proceedings as regards the influence of the impugned articles the court reiterates that it is important for journalists who write articles on pending criminal proceedings not to reduce a persons chances of having a fair trial which involves respecting the defendants right to be presumed innocent and not to undermine public confidence in the role played by the courts in the administration of justice encompassing the opinionforming and decisionmaking processes within the judiciary see tourancheau and july cited above and and bédat cited above in such matters a mere risk of influencing the subsequent proceedings may suffice and this risk must be assessed at the time when the authorities take the relevant deterrent measures see bédat cited above α the articles of december and february visàvis b the court observes that in the proceedings on the merits the firstinstance court found that the interest in informing the public about the bettencourt affair outweighed any other interest worthy of protection under section of the act and concerning the authority and impartiality of the judiciary under this provision the court of appeal however stated that the bias displayed by the articles against b had reduced his chances of a fair trial and made it necessary for him to explain his position on prosecution evidence that had not yet been debated before a court of law that was also the position of the urgent proceedings judge see paragraph above the court has already indicated that in the present case the impugned articles painted a negative picture of b based on information from procedural documents reproduced verbatim in the courts view the publication of the articles on december the day before bs appearance at the nanterre criminal court and on february two months before the hearing scheduled for april was liable to heavily influence the outcome of the proceedings with potential repercussions on individuals who might subsequently be called to give testimony in court or even on the judges hearing the case the court reiterates in this connection that the publication of a slanted article is capable of undermining the objectivity of the trial court irrespective of its composition see bédat cited above moreover while it is true that b had specific remedies at his disposal to secure respect for his right to be presumed innocent such as that provided for in article of the civil code which particularly concerns the media the court notes that bs case before the civil court was declared admissible and that the incriminating effect of the publication was emphasised by that court in conclusion the court does not agree with the applicants that the extensive media coverage of the case vindicated the verbatim publication of numerous and lengthy excerpts from procedural documents given the complex issues before the courts as regards both the vulnerability of mrs bettencourt and the material element of the offence of undue influence with which b was charged the publication of those documents in the framework of biased articles risked disrupting the proper conduct of the proceedings and jeopardising bs right to a fair trial the court confirms in this connection that the ban provided for in section of the act is not general and absolute in nature and does not totally restrict the right of the press to inform the public being temporary and limited see tourancheau and july cited above consequently it takes the view that the applicants as media professionals were in a position to avoid such risks without affecting the substance of the information that they wished to impartβ the article of february visàvis mrs bettencourt as regards the article of february visàvis mrs bettencourt the court observes that the urgent proceedings brought by her led to an acknowledgment of the damage she had sustained in so far as the publication was capable of contravening her rights in portraying her prior to the examination of the criminal case in the nanterre criminal court as a manipulated and weak woman a portrayal which she denied see paragraph above as mrs bettencourt had filed submissions by way of voluntary intervention with in the alternative an application to join the criminal court proceedings as a civil party and in view of the content of the information conveyed to the reader the court acknowledges that the publication was capable of having negative effects on the proper administration of justicev whether there was a breach of privacy the court can not but note that in the course of the proceedings no breach of bs privacy was found by the domestic courts b who was very well known did not in fact claim such a breach in his legal actions as to mrs bettencourt the domestic courts did not find any breach of her privacy on account of her situation which exposed her to public attention or of the potential interest of the public in reading about hervi whether the sanction was proportionate in the present case as regards the proceedings brought by b the applicants were ordered in the urgent proceedings to pay an advance of eur and to publish a notice of the judgment and in the proceedings on the merits to pay eur in respect of the nonpecuniary damage with the publication of a further notice in the urgent proceedings brought by mrs bettencourt the applicants were ordered to pay an advance of eur the court takes the view that those sanctions can not be deemed excessive or capable of having a chilling effect on the exercise of media freedomvii conclusion the court concludes that the reasons put forward by the domestic courts to justify the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression as a result of the judgments against them were relevant and sufficient for the purposes of article in particular the interest of the applicants and that of the public in imparting and receiving information on the subject of a question in the general interest was not such as to prevail over the considerations raised by the domestic courts as to the consequences for the protection of the rights of others and the proper administration of justice the judgments against the applicants met a sufficiently compelling social need to take precedence over the public interest in the freedom of the press and those judgments can not be deemed disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued there has therefore been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in french and notified in writing on june pursuant to rule and of the rules of court milan blaško angelika nußberger deputy registrar president,,,
33,in and lives in gilserberg she was represented by ms g pahl a lawyer practising in hamburg the government were represented by one of their agents ms n wenzel of the federal ministry of justice and consumer protection the facts of the case may be summarised as follows background to the casethe applicants political activities from until early the applicant was a member of the political party the republicans die partei der republikaner the party is generally considered to be rightwing and has been under scrutiny by the offices for the protection of the constitution verfassungsschutzämter in various german länder it has not however been declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court under article of the german basic law for earlier cases concerning members of that party see otto v germany dec no november and erdel v germany dec no february the applicant sat on the schwalm eder district council kreistag and stood for election to both the federal parliament bundestag and to the parliament of the land of hesse landtag on behalf of that party in march the applicant was elected to the district council on behalf of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance bürgerbündnis pro schwalm eder and served in that role until her resignation in late the domestic courts established that several members of that alliances board as composed at that time had links with organisations of the extreme right see paragraphs and below in addition to her membership in and activities on behalf of these parties and organisations the applicant expressed herself publicly at political rallies and in lectures and interviews over the years the applicants employment as a teacher the applicant trained as a teacher for lower secondary schools passing her first and second state exams in and she exercised this profession for limited periods and at irregular intervals in the academic year she worked at a public secondary school in eltville in the land of hesse on a fixedterm contract she received a positive appraisal report for that academic year and in the academic year she again worked at the same school on a fixedterm contract in a letter of march the competent authorities terminated the applicants employment contract with immediate effect citing doubts as to her loyalty to the constitution verfassungstreue in early april the hesse ministry of culture notified all public education authorities in hesse that the applicants employment contract had been terminated on the grounds of significant doubts as to her loyalty to the constitution and asked to be notified immediately if the applicant applied for another post the applicant brought an action against the termination of her employment contract before the wiesbaden labour court those proceedings ended with a friendly settlement concluded on may which read the employment contract will be terminated upon expiry of the fixed term specified therein that is on july the applicant will remain entitled to remuneration until the termination date but will be released from her work duties the parties hereby agree that an offer of employment issued in february will be deemed null and void the land against which the action was brought hereby undertakes to delete from the personnel files any mention of the dismissal the applicant will receive a favourable appraisal report which specifies the date of termination as july that appraisal report was issued on august and any mention of the dismissal was deleted from her personnel files the applicants inclusion on the authorities list in an email of may the hesse ministry of culture asked the darmstadt public education authority schulamt to ensure through the centralised office for the management of teaching personnel that the applicant would not be included on any shortlists of potential teachers for public schools in hesse in late the hesse ministry of culture in cooperation with the decentralised hesse public education authorities decided to set up a list containing information regarding teachers deemed unsuitable for reappointment to a teaching post at a school the list the list was maintained by the centralised office for the management of teaching personnel in hesse and access was restricted to ten individuals working at that office as well as to two individuals at each of the fifteen decentralised hesse public education authorities in the event that they received a job application education authorities in other german länder and private schools in hesse did not have the right to inspect the list and it would have been unlawful to transmit any information in the list to them according to the notification by the hesse ministry of culture the fact that the name of a job applicant appeared on the list did not obviate the need to examine his or her suitability in each individual case public education authorities in hesse seeking to recruit thus retained the discretion to make their own decision as to the suitability of a job applicant included on the list by a letter of december the applicant was notified that her name had been included on the list the list entry concerning the applicant read noninclusion in the shortlist reasons attributable to the person the proceedings in issue on december the applicant requested that her name and information about her be deleted from the list by a letter of january the competent authorities rejected the applicants request the applicant brought an action which in a judgment of august the darmstadt administrative court dismissed as illfounded finding that the applicant was not entitled to have her name deleted from the list her inclusion and retention on the list and the processing of the information relating to her had a legal basis in section of the hesse data protection act in conjunction with sections d and g of the hesse civil servants act see paragraphs below the provisions of the latter act applying mutatis mutandis to state employees who were not civil servants there was sufficient evidence both at the time of her inclusion on the list and at the time of the administrative courts judgment that the applicant was not committed to the free democratic constitutional order freiheitlichdemokratische grundordnung in every aspect of her conduct contrary to the requirements of section second sentence of the collective agreement for public service in hesse tarifvertrag für den öffentlichen dienst des landes hessen see paragraph below the administrative court found that the respondent authority had acted within its margin of appreciation when it had concluded that there were serious doubts as to the applicants loyalty to the constitution and that she was unsuitable to work as a teacher at a public school in hesse indeed it could not be taken for granted that the applicant would uphold the free democratic constitutional order at all times or that she would convey the basic values and principles of the constitution to her pupils in a credible manner observing that political engagement for an organisation that was hostile to the constitution could be a relevant factor even if the organisation concerned had not been declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court under article of the basic law the administrative court considered that the applicant had been an active member of the republicans from to early and had represented that party as a member of the schwalm eder district council and as a candidate in elections at both the federal and land level this membership and these activities in the republicans a party in respect of which there were manifold indications that it was not committed to protecting in particular the dignity of foreigners and asylumseekers living in germany could serve as a first indication that there might be doubts as to the applicants loyalty to the constitution her letter of january to the partys hesse leadership in which she had declared that she was ending her party membership reinforced these doubts her primary motivation for her withdrawal from the party had been that she did not share the concern expressed by the party leadership about cooperation with members of the national democratic party of germany nationaldemokratische partei deutschlands npd who had stood for election to the district council as part of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance in that letter the applicant had displayed an attitude that was very critical of the german state as evidenced by her statements that there was no risk of that alliance abolishing the free democratic constitutional order as such order had ceased to exist a long time ago and that she would make every effort to reinstate a free order deliberately omitting the word democratic her activities on behalf of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance were an important element for assessing the question of doubts as to her loyalty to the constitution several members of that alliance and in particular the members of its board including fr had links to extremeright organisations notably to the npd and neo nazi groups and had become known for their extremist opinions the applicant could not successfully claim that the opinions of the alliances other members could not be attributed to her given that she had chosen to run for the march elections to the district council and to serve as a member of the district council on behalf of that alliance until her resignation in late doubts as to the applicants loyalty to the constitution also followed from her appearance at political rallies of inter alia a youth organisation of the extreme right and her interviews with the npd magazine die deutsche stimme german voice she had engaged in such activities in but also as late as april when she had spoken at a rally of the russian german conservatives stating that sixty years after the war we still bow to what the victors decreed and accept halftruths and lies about our own people her appearances at events of the silesian youth thuringia or the young witikons groups were similarly characterised by aggressiveness towards state institutions while she could legitimately object to kin liability in respect of the political views of her husband who had been described as an american neo nazi previously belonging to an important extremeright organisation in the united states of america and who had served as the district chairman of the npd since the similarity in political views was evident from the fact that four members of the family including the applicant had run as candidates for the district council elections in on behalf of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance the applicant had never distanced herself from her past political activities but had merely declared that she did not intend to be politically active in the future the administrative court considered that at the time of its judgment this was insufficient to dispel the doubts for the purposes of a forwardlooking assessment as to her loyalty to the constitution which had justifiably arisen following years of political activities she could legitimately be expected to explicitly express her commitment to the free democratic constitutional order and to declare that she did not support movements pursuing contrary aims or in the alternative that she had turned away from such movements after having previously supported them however rather than doing so the applicant had defended her activities and merely stated that she did not pursue aims that were hostile to the constitution observing that her retention on the list meant that the applicant for the time being de facto had no possibility of being hired as a teacher at a public school in hesse the administrative court considered that this did not constitute an unjustified interference with her freedom of profession berufsfreiheit under article of the basic law in view of the importance of protecting the constitutional order and the risk that a teacher who opposed that order could abuse his or her role of educating the children entrusted to him or her the authorities were allowed to question the teachers loyalty to the constitution even if there had not yet been any workrelated reproaches applications by the applicant for a teaching post at private schools in hesse or at schools in other german länder were not futile as access to the list was limited to the hesse authorities and could not be transmitted to other authorities for reasons of data protection lastly the applicants inclusion on the list was not in conflict with the friendly settlement concluded in see paragraph above as that did not prevent the authorities from continuing to doubt the applicants loyalty to the constitution and seeking to prevent her reappointment as a teacher at a public school in hesse on september the applicant requested leave to appeal the administrative courts judgment submitting that she was not unsuitable to work as a teacher and that the judgment had breached her freedom of opinion under article of the basic law and her freedom of profession under article of the basic law she argued that not a single school in germany would hire her as a result of her inclusion on the list which had a stigmatising effect she had always strictly separated her political activities and her work as a teacher and there had never been any detrimental effect on her work as a teacher as also evidenced by the positive appraisal reports she had received her previous membership in and activities on behalf of the republicans were not in themselves sufficient to question her loyalty to the constitution nor did these activities or those on behalf of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance render her unsuitable to work as a teacher political views held by other members of that alliance could not be attributed to her as a member of the district council from which she had resigned in late she had never made any statements that were hostile to the constitution xenophobic or extremist she did not intend to pursue any political activity in the future neither the russian german conservatives nor the silesian youth thuringia or the young witikons were deemed to be hostile to the constitution or being monitored for that reason references to her husband were inadmissible she could not be required to distance herself from her prior political activities also bearing in mind that she did not aim to become a civil servant and that a lesser degree of loyalty was required from public employees who were not civil servants lastly her retention on the list was in breach of the friendly settlement reached in in which the authorities had undertaken to remove the dismissal notice from her personnel file this also meant that doubts as to her loyalty to the constitution could not be based on her past political activities by an order of september the hesse administrative court of appeal dismissed the applicants request for leave to appeal as illfounded finding that there were no serious doubts as to the correctness of the administrative courts judgment as regards the compatibility of the impugned measure with the applicants freedom of profession under article of the basic law the court considered that the applicant was unsuitable for a teaching post at a public school in hesse and that the measure which aimed to prevent her reappointment to such a post was proportionate in view of the public interest at stake it was true that not all employees working in public service arbeitnehmer im öffentlichen dienst were per se subject to an enhanced obligation of loyalty to the constitution comparable to the one imposed on civil servants beamte rather the extent of their obligation of loyalty depended on their position and the tasks they performed which meant that teachers were subject to an enhanced duty of political loyalty which was equivalent or came close to the one placed on teachers who were civil servants teachers had to teach the children entrusted to them in a credible manner about the basic values of the constitution children and adolescents in public schools should recognise that freedom democracy and the rule of law were values worth upholding a teacher who did not relate positively to the basic values and principles of the constitution was unable to convince his or her pupils that democracy was worth defending moreover there was a risk that such a teacher would sway his or her students against the basic values of the constitution pupils were wholly at the mercy of the teachers influence the role played by teachers was therefore one of enormous significance from a publicpolicy perspective the administrative court of appeal added that standards differed depending on whether the matter concerned the termination of an existing employment contract or as in the present case potential reappointment to a post whereas general doubts as to the individuals loyalty to the constitution were not sufficient to justify the termination of an existing employment contract such general doubts were sufficient to justify the decision not to recruit an individual with the employer enjoying a margin of appreciation in the applicants case there were sufficient general doubts as to her loyalty to the constitution the existence of workrelated reproaches or detrimental effects on her work as a result of her political activities was therefore not required and the applicants submissions as to her positive appraisal reports and her separation of professional and political activities were beside the point in respect of the existence of such general doubts as to the applicants loyalty to the constitution and her challenges of that assessment the administrative court of appeal in essence repeated the grounds given by the administrative court see paragraphs above the administrative court of appeal added that the pro schwalm eder civic alliance had been deemed hostile to the constitution and that the applicant had voluntarily chosen to run as the alliances top candidate in the elections to the district council as such she could not legitimately avoid being identified with the political aims of the alliances other members and candidates it also reiterated that membership in and activities on behalf of parties and organisations that were hostile to the constitution such as the ones with or on behalf of which the applicant had voluntarily and actively engaged was a relevant aspect in the assessment of doubts as to loyalty to the constitution in the context of the persons potential employment even if the respective parties or organisations had not been declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court under article of the basic law having regard to the foregoing and to the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the land in question in relation to applicants for employment the administrative court of appeal concluded that there were objective grounds for that land to seek to prevent the applicants employment as a teacher at a public school in hesse in these circumstances including the applicant on the list was not disproportionate to the aim pursued the applicants inclusion on the list provided any of the decentralised public education authorities with an effective opportunity to examine existing reservations as to the applicants appointment in a potential future recruitment procedure no more lenient equally suitable measure could be discerned access to the list was heavily restricted which limited the severity of the interference with the applicants rights access was restricted to ten individuals within the centralised office for the management of teaching personnel in the land of hesse which administered the list as well as to two individuals at each of the decentralised public education authorities in hesse the list was for internal use only and the information contained therein was not transmitted beyond the said authorities in hesse notably neither private schools in hesse nor authorities in other länder had a right to inspect the list the impact of the applicants inclusion and retention on the list was therefore limited to making it more difficult or preventing her appointment at a public school in hesse it did not negatively affect the applicants chances of employment at public schools in other länder or at private schools in hesse there was no reason to believe that her job applications at a private school in hesse and at a public school in another land had been unsuccessful because of her inclusion on the list contrary to what she had alleged given that the relevant employers did not have access to it it was much more likely that her applications had been unsuccessful for other reasons or that her political activities and public appearances had led to her being publicly known in so far as the applicant had invoked the friendly settlement of may that agreement did not feature any undertaking in respect of a future reappointment of the applicant at a public school in hesse nor an undertaking that the circumstances which had led to the applicants dismissal would not be considered in connection with her potential reappointment lastly even assuming that the impugned measure constituted an interference with the applicants right to freedom of opinion under article of the basic law such interference was not disproportionate in view of the enormous importance of and public interest in educating children in a credible manner about the basic values of the constitution on october the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint which the federal constitutional court decided not to accept for adjudication without providing reasons decision no bv r of may the decision was served on the applicant on june the applicants political activities after in their observations the government submitted that the applicant had continued to engage in political activities for the extreme right contrary to what she had submitted before the domestic courts by way of example they referred to a lecture given in barcelona in entitled inge godenau la democracia manipulada during the talk a flag of the npd had been on display and a member of the audience had been wearing a tshirt with a slightly modified swastika the promotional materials for the event had described the applicant as belonging to a family of militant and founding members of the npd the government pointed out that a simple internet search of the applicants name brought up a large number of online posts letters and speeches expressing extremist opinions some of which could engage criminal liability with her contributions covering topics such as her nonrecognition of polands national borders her criticism of the presentation of historical events in school textbooks and allegations that the press was lying the government submitted examples of the applicants statements to the court including the following id be remiss to end my post without referring to the brutal regime which allegedly murdered millions of jews and was responsible for millions more deaths during the second world war researchers do not by any means share a single opinion as regards the former and as regards the latter it is now commonly accepted that germany neither planned nor wanted to go to war another statement by the applicant was to the effect that germany had no constitution since a portion of the population remained under polish administration the opinion of the entire german people on the matter had not been sought the applicant did not dispute that she had made those statements relevant legal framework and practice the relevant provisions of the basic law grundgesetz read as follows article everyone shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his or her opinions in speech writing and pictures these rights shall be subject to the limitations laid down by the provisions of the general laws and by

hesse tarifvertrag öffentlicher dienst des landes hessen provided at the material time as follows the work required under the employment contract must be performed prudently and conscientiously every aspect of an employees conduct must reflect his or her commitment to the concept of a free democratic constitutional order within the meaning of the basic law according to the wellestablished caselaw of the domestic courts the suitability for employment in public service within the meaning of article of the basic law entails a duty of loyalty to the constitution see for example federal labour court no azr judgment of may at para juris with further references state employees with civil servant status are subject to an enhanced duty of loyalty ibid at para with further references the extent of the duty of loyalty owed by state employees employed under privatelaw contracts depends on their position and the tasks they perform ibid at para with further references section of the hesse data

execute terminate or wind up the employment relationship or to implement internal planning organisational welfare and personnel measures or where said processing is provided for by a legislative

accordance with section d when data are first stored the data subject must be notified of the type of personal data stored in accordance with subsection the data subject must also be notified of any significant modifications to the data the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained about the refusal to delete her name from the information list of teachers deemed unsuitable for reappointment to a teaching post by the hesse public education authorities she relied on article which reads as follows article everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility incompatibility ratione materiae the government argued that the complaint was incompatible ratione materiae with article of the convention as it concerned in essence the right to recruitment to the civil service according to the wellestablished caselaw of the court the right to recruitment to civil service had deliberately been omitted from the convention and as such the refusal to appoint a person as a civil servant could not provide the basis for a complaint under the convention they referred to inter alia glasenapp v germany august series a no wille v liechtenstein gc no echr vii and otto v germany dec no november the circumstances of the present case were distinct from those in wille in that case the president of the liechtenstein administrative court had been reprimanded for opinions he had expressed in the course of the performance of his duties the possibility of appointment to another office had not formed the subject of the dispute by contrast the actions taken by the authorities in the present case had not related to the ongoing employment of a civil servant instead the proceedings had concerned a measure the inclusion on a list of persons deemed unsuitable for appointment to a teaching post which affected only individuals who had already left the public service and which would make their recruitment more difficult if they applied for positions at public schools in the future the applicants earlier dismissal in respect of which a friendly settlement had been reached in the proceedings before the wiesbaden labour court was not the subject matter of the present case distinguishing it from that in vogt v germany september series a no the applicant submitted that the refusal to delete her name from the list in issue had constituted a disproportionate interference with her rights under article of the convention the court reiterates that the refusal to appoint a person as a public servant can not as such provide the basis for a complaint under the convention see cimperšek v slovenia no june with further references however in a recent case the court putting the scope of the measure in the context of the facts of the case and the relevant legislation held that the refusal to appoint an applicant who had succeeded in the relevant examination to a public service post because of statements he had made was a measure that essentially related to freedom of expression and not access to public service ibid while the applicants inclusion and retention on the list in issue undoubtedly aimed to prevent her appointment to a teaching post at a public school in hesse the subject matter of the present case is not whether the applicant had a right to be recruited to public service and she did not complain about the authorities refusal to appoint her as a teacher rather the matter before the court is the refusal to delete her name from the list of teachers deemed unsuitable for reappointment to a teaching post maintained by the hesse authorities which list pursued the purpose of providing information to any of the decentralised public education authorities in hesse that may receive a job application by the applicant however any such authority retained a discretion whether to recruit the applicant or not see paragraph above it is not disputed that the applicant was included on that list because of the opinions she had expressed and the political activities she had engaged in the court can accept that this measure essentially related to freedom of expression and that article of the convention is applicable to the applicants complaint see mutatis mutandis cimperšek cited above et seq it follows that the governments objection as to the applicability of article of the convention must be dismissed at the same time the court points out that it does not follow from the applicability ratione materiae of article of the convention that the applicant had a right to be appointed to a teaching post at a public school in hesse incompatibility ratione personae the government maintained that the applicant could not claim to be a victim of a convention violation for the purposes of article of the convention her inclusion on the list viewed in isolation had not directly affected the applicant she would only be directly affected by her inclusion in the list if she applied for a teaching post at a public school in hesse and her application was rejected because of her inclusion on the list the applicant had made a general statement that she had not been appointed to a teaching post by any public or private school in hesse or other german länder as a result of her inclusion on the list but she had not submitted that any application she had made at a school in hesse had been unsuccessful for that reason while she had claimed that her application at a private school in north rhine westphalia had been unsuccessful it had been ruled out that the rejection of her application had been causally linked to her inclusion on the list since a private school in another land had no right to inspect that list it was more likely that the private school concerned had learned about the applicants political views from the internet where many statements by the applicant and information about her activities were available as evidenced by the lecture she had organised in barcelona in the inclusion on the list in question had not deterred the applicant from continuing her political activities and expressing her views which meant that the impugned measure had not had a chilling effect on her they referred to petropavlovskis v latvia no echr the applicant did not specifically comment on this aspect the court reiterates that in order to lodge an application in accordance with article of the convention an individual must be able to show that he or she was directly affected by the measure complained of see akbay and others v germany nos and others october with further references in the present case the administrative courts did not declare the applicants action concerning the authoritys refusal to delete her name from the list inadmissible it being noted that claiming to be directly affected in ones rights by the administrative act or refusal is an admissibility requirement for actions before administrative courts under german law what is more the domestic courts considered that her inclusion and retention on that list had at least made her appointment at a public school in hesse considerably more difficult see paragraphs and above in these circumstances and taking into account that the very purpose of the applicants inclusion and retention on the list was to prevent her reappointment to a teaching post at a public school in hesse it would be overly formalistic to require the applicant to apply for such a post first and be rejected or to consider that she was not directly affected for the purposes of article of the convention by the refusal to delete her name from the list it follows that the governments objection must be dismissed conclusion the court notes that this complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merits the parties submissionsa the applicant the applicant relying on vogt cited above submitted that her inclusion on and refusal to delete her information from the list a measure which had been based on the opinions she had expressed as well as her membership in and activities on behalf of certain political parties and associations had breached her rights under article of the convention while she had been critical of certain aspects of the political situation in germany such as the significant power of the media and the governments asylum policy the authorities conclusion that she had been hostile to the constitution was untenable it had to be possible to express legitimate criticism and she had no reason to distance herself from the opinions she had expressed no specific evidence of her alleged hostility to the constitution had ever been presented the allegations against her had been unsubstantiated based on wrongful assumptions and mostly referred to the associations she had been part of while it was true that certain members of the republicans were considered as being hostile to the constitution the party had not been banned and moreover the applicant had left the party as a member of the district council she had never made any statements that were hostile to the constitution extremist or xenophobic nor had she acted in such a manner it was true that she had been politically active but being politically active was a protected fundamental right it was unjust that citizens were invited to engage politically but had their livelihoods destroyed if their political engagement did not take the desired form during her studies she had never been told that working as a teacher would entail a restriction of her fundamental rights the applicant submitted that it was incorrect that fr an individual who had become known for his extremist opinions was a member of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance in any event she had resigned as a member of the district council in and had not been politically active since in response to the governments observations in which they referred to her activities after the applicant acknowledged that she had attended a conference in barcelona in but disputed that she had organised it she had no knowledge of the picture of that conference on the internet it was also untrue that she gave regular interviews to die deutsche stimme she had given only one interview after being asked to do so following her dismissal similarly the authorities conclusion that she was unsuitable for a teaching post was untenable the school where she had worked from to was located some kilometres away from the schwalm eder district and at that school it had not been known that she had been a member of the district council in the latter location as a teacher she had always paid attention to expressing herself in a neutral and matteroffact manner she had never expressed her opinion on politics there had never been any reproaches of her professional conduct or performance indeed she had received very positive appraisal reports and the management of the school had offered her a permanent position her dismissal had been unjustified and had been withdrawn following the friendly settlement before the labour court and was thus null and void she had had no choice but to agree to that friendly settlement as she had found herself in a financially precarious situation in sum none of the requirements for inclusion in the list either to have been dismissed from a teaching post with immediate effect or professional deficiencies applied to her the retention of her name on the list made it impossible for her to work as a teacher no school was going to hire her ever since her inclusion on the list all her applications for teaching posts had been unsuccessful including at private schools or at public schools in other german länder she had been unemployed and living off welfare benefits ever sinceb the government even assuming that there had been an interference with the applicants article rights the government maintained that it had been justified states enjoyed a very broad margin of appreciation in respect of civil service in germany political activity was allowed up to the limit of conduct engaging criminal liability but civil servants and state employees had a duty of loyalty to the constitution the degree of which depended on their particular function school attendance was compulsory in germany and teachers thus had a vital role to play by teaching their pupils about the foundations of germanys democratic system and the basic values of the constitution they stood as guarantors for living together in a free and democratic state the duty of loyalty imposed upon teachers which entailed restrictions of their freedom of expression a fact which individuals were aware of when choosing the profession constituted a central pillar of germanys defensive democracy and was of vital importance from a publicpolicy perspective teachers who had reservations about or openly opposed the democratic system would be constrained in their ability to teach pupils that freedom democracy and the rule of law were values worth defending reiterating the essence of the domestic courts assessments as to the existence of doubts as to the applicants loyalty to the constitution notably her political activities and statements in their entirety the government explained that the threshold for declaring a political party unconstitutional under article of the basic law was high and that a party that was hostile to the constitution would therefore not necessarily be declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court in the light of the reaffirmation of the applicants views and ideas in her observations in the proceedings before the court it was inconceivable that she would successfully be able to convey the basic values of the german constitution to pupils the government emphasised that the applicant appeared to have acknowledged that her initial claim that she had not been politically active since had been incorrect in so far as there was a dispute as to the facts relating to activities on behalf of certain organisations and groups the government noted that in its judgment the administrative court had established that fr an individual who had become known for his extremist opinions had been a member of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance as it had done in respect of the applicants appearances at political rallies and her role as an interviewee as regards her participation in the conference in barcelona the government pointed out that its advertisement had borne her name in the title and that any potential lack of knowledge as to any documentation of her lecture or pictures taken did not take away from the fact that she had participated in it she had also not distanced herself from that fact or the views she had expressed there she had described herself as a victim of the system because her employment contract had been terminated and stated that germanys democratic system was riddled with hypocrisy and that the country was in the process of de germanisation if anything the views she expressed had over time become more radical rather than more moderate importantly the applicants political views and her work as a teacher were linked contrary to what she had submitted by way of example the government referred to the speech she had given at the rally held by the russian german conservatives in april which had focused on a description of historical events in a school textbook as well as the part of her speech cited by the domestic courts see paragraph above the applicant had also stated and so today we are demonstrating not only against the lies in that school textbook but also and in particular against the undemocratic rabblerousing of the media there are three things you need to know about the press radio and television today the first is that they lie the second is that they lie and the third is that if they do tell the truth they tell only half the truth the last is the worst of all three because a complete lie is easier to detect than a halftruth at an earlier rally of the russian german conservatives in april she had stated our history textbooks are written from the perspective of the winners and thats why one of them contains statements about the russian germans which are untrue and thats why were protesting here today we must not stand by and watch the victims of bolshevik violence be turned into perpetrators those of us gathered here today believe in the truth we are calling for lies about historical facts to be removed from school textbooks our children must not be told lies about their grandfathers and greatgrandfathers the time has come to put an end to the selfdebasement of our people we are calling for genuine freedom of opinion and not simply the acceptance of only one monolithic and politically correct opinion in most german länder there were central recruitment agencies which were able to consult the personnel records of individuals applying to work as a teacher and to find out whether any of their previous contracts of employment had been terminated on grounds of unsuitability in hesse teachers at public schools were at least in some cases appointed on a decentralised basis by the relevant public education authorities the list in issue pursued the aim of avoiding that individuals whose prior employment as a teacher had been terminated because they had been found unsuitable such as the applicant be recruited by a decentralised public education authority which was unaware of those facts indeed the applicants political activities had not been known at the time of her recruitment to the post from which she had subsequently been dismissed as soon as they had become known she had been dismissed in the friendly settlement concluded in the authorities had not undertaken to refrain from including the applicants name on an information list or from taking into account the facts that had led to her dismissal when deciding whether to appoint her to another teaching post inclusion and retention on the list did not constitute a severe interference access to the list was heavily restricted among hesse public education authorities and neither public schools in other german länder nor private schools in hesse had access to the list or to the information contained therein inclusion on the list did not entail a ban on working as a teacher in the event of the applicant applying for a teaching post at a public school in hesse an assessment of her suitability would have to be carried out and the school concerned remained free to recruit the applicant regardless of her inclusion on the list moreover deletion from the list could be requested on the basis of a change in the relevant circumstances the applicant had simply not submitted any evidence concerning a change in such circumstances lastly as the applicant was a french language teacher and had also worked as an english language teacher her qualifications would allow her to work at language schools the courts assessment having regard to its considerations in respect of the applicability of article of the convention see paragraph above the court finds that the refusal to delete the applicants name from the list interfered with her rights under article of the convention it follows that the court needs to examine whether the interference was justified in accordance with article of the convention that is whether it was prescribed by law whether it pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in that paragraph and whether it was necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve those aims the inclusion and retention of the applicants name on the list was based on section of the hesse data protection act in conjunction with sections d and g of the hesse civil servants act see paragraphs above and served to inform future decisions by the relevant hesse public education authority should the applicant apply for a job at a public school in hesse the performance of such checks concerning the suitability for employment in public service was based on article of the basic law and section of the collective agreement for public service in hesse see paragraphs above noting that in accordance with the caselaw of the domestic courts such suitability entailed a duty of loyalty to the constitution see paragraph above and that the applicants name was retained on the list in question precisely because of doubts as to such loyalty on her part and that she had been informed about her inclusion on the list without delay the court considers that the impugned measure was prescribed by law the court has already recognised in earlier cases that the duty of loyalty to the constitution imposed on civil servants and public employees under german law was an expression of a democracy capable of defending itself and that restrictions on the freedom of expression of teachers deriving from that duty of loyalty pursued legitimate aims under article of the convention notably the prevention of disorder and the protection of the rights of others see vogt cited above and volkmer v germany dec no november it considers that this applies to the applicants inclusion and retention on the list which pursed the purpose of serving as a basis for a decision on her potential applications for a job at public schools in hesse it being noted that teachers at public schools may be appointed by any of the decentralised hesse public education authorities concerning a teacher who was a civil servant under german law the court considered that when determining whether a fair balance has been struck between the fundamental right of the individual to freedom of expression and the legitimate aim of a democratic state in ensuring that its civil service properly furthered the purposes enumerated in article of the convention whenever civil servants right to freedom of expression was in issue the duties and responsibilities referred to in article of the convention assumed a special significance which justified leaving to the national authorities a certain margin of appreciation in determining whether the impugned interference was proportionate to the above aim see vogt cited above in subsequent cases concerning teachers the court did not delve into the question whether their status under the relevant domestic law was that of civil servants or other public employees and instead focused on their role as teachers being a symbol of authority for their pupils in the field of education and reiterated that the particular duties and responsibilities incumbent on them also applied to a certain extent to their activities outside school see mahi v belgium dec no july with further references the court sees no reason to depart from this approach in the present case and dismisses as irrelevant the applicants submission that she was not and did not aspire to become a civil servant within the meaning of domestic law it notes the approach taken by the domestic courts according to which as far as public employees were concerned the decisive element for the duty of loyalty to the constitution and the degree of loyalty owed was the role and function exercised by the individual and that a high degree of such loyalty was owed by teachers which was equivalent or came close to that owed by civil servants in this connection the court emphasises the enormous importance from a publicpolicy perspective of teaching and educating children in a credible manner about freedom democracy human rights and the rule of law as in vogt cited above it is undisputed that the applicants work as a teacher had been wholly satisfactory and there were no indications that she had sought to take advantage of her position to indoctrinate or exert improper influence on her pupils during lessons however in vogt there was no evidence that the applicant had actually made statements that were hostile to the constitution or had personally adopted such a stance the only criticisms retained against her had concerned her active membership of and the posts held in a political party and her candidature in the elections for a land parliament cited above by contrast in the present case the domestic authorities did not merely rely on the applicants active membership in the republicans from to and the fact that she had sat on the district council and stood as a candidate in several elections for that party rather they relied heavily on the applicants additional activities and statements to conclude that there were doubts as to her loyalty to the constitution they took into consideration inter alia the reasons the applicant had given for leaving the republicans that is that she did not share the concern expressed by the party leadership about a cooperation with members of the npd who were part of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance and her statement that there was no risk of that alliance abolishing the free democratic constitutional order as such order had ceased to exist a long time ago and that she would make every effort to reinstate a free order deliberately omitting the word democratic see paragraphs and above the domestic courts also took into consideration the applicants subsequent membership of and active engagement on behalf of that alliance which had been deemed to be hostile to the constitution see paragraphs and above as well as statements she had made at political rallies see paragraphs and above and the fact that she had not distanced herself from her activities see paragraphs and above the court is therefore satisfied that the domestic courts based their conclusion that there were doubts as to the applicants loyalty to the constitution on a wellreasoned assessment of the relevant facts it notes that the additional submissions made by the government in their observations both about the link between the applicants statements and her work as a teacher see paragraph above and her continued public statements in the years after her resignation from the district council in late see paragraph above in so far as they are uncontested see paragraphs and above reinforce the conclusion reached by the domestic courts another significant difference between the present case and that in vogt are the nature and consequences of the impugned measure the applicant in vogt had been dismissed from her post which the court considered as a very severe measure inter alia because of the effect it had on her reputation cited above what is in issue in the present case by contrast is not the applicants dismissal but rather her inclusion and retention on an internal list of teachers deemed unsuitable for future reappointment to a teaching post which was maintained by the authorities a very limited number of public officials in hesse had access to this list and her inclusion and retention on it which was not known or visible to the public can not be said to have had a severe negative effect on her reputation what is more the applicants dismissal in vogt which terminated with immediate effect her existing employment as a civil servant which was of an indefinite duration under the relevant domestic law constituted a severe interference with her existing rights in the present case by contrast the applicant was not employed at the time her name was included on the list and none of her existing positions or rights were interfered with rather her inclusion and retention on the list pursued the aim of preventing her future appointment to a teaching post at a public school in hesse in this respect it constitutes an important element of proportionality that the relevant decentralised public education authorities in hesse were not prevented from recruiting the applicant to a teaching post and were obliged to examine her suitability in the event of receiving a job application by the applicant see paragraphs and above moreover neither public schools in any of the other german länder nor private schools in hesse had access to the list or the information contained therein and consequently the applicants inclusion and retention on the list could not possibly prevent her appointment to or negatively affect her application for a teaching post at a public school in another land or at a private school in hesse as established by the domestic courts see paragraphs and above lastly even though the domestic courts dismissed the applicants request to have her name deleted from the list finding that there continued to be grounds for doubting her loyalty to the constitution and for retaining her name on the list the possibility for the applicant to request such deletion at any point in time and to obtain a comprehensive judicial review as to the existence at the time of the domestic courts assessment of doubts concerning her political loyalty constitutes an important procedural safeguard which is a factor to be taken into account in the proportionality assessment see baka v hungary gc no june having regard to the foregoing considerations the court concludes that the domestic authorities adduced relevant and sufficient reasons and did not overstep their margin of appreciation the interference with the applicants freedom of expression was therefore proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued and was thus necessary in a democratic society there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention alleged violation of articles and of the convention the applicant also relied on articles and of the convention to complain about the same measure alleging that she had been discriminated against because of her political views and that a double standard was applied depending on which end of the political spectrum teachers belonged to having regard to the facts of the case and the parties submissions which essentially referred to the arguments they had made in respect of article its findings under that latter provision and the parallels it has drawn in its assessments under articles and in earlier cases concerning the dismissal of teachers see for example volkmer cited above the court considers that it has examined the main legal questions raised in the present application and that there is thus no need to give a separate ruling on the remaining complaints see mutatis mutandis centre for legal resources on behalf of valentin câmpeanu v romania gc no echr for these reasons the court unanimouslydeclares the complaint under article of the convention admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention holds that there is no need to examine separately the admissibility and merits of the applicants complaint under articles and of the convention done in english and notified in writing on november pursuant to rule and of the rules of court ilse freiwirth gabriele kucsko stadlmayer deputy registrar president,,,
34,the applicant was born in and lives in pirna the applicant had been employed as head of the subdivision in charge of sanctioning misuse of housing property zweckentfremdung in the housing office of the municipality of dresden since on december a meeting of the staff of the housing office took place in the presence of the deputy mayor for economy and housing w an elected official who inter alia governed the housing office and of a number of staff and trade union representatives following a short address on the issue of the expiry of the regulation on misuse of housing property by december given by w the applicant took the floor and accused w of having committed perversion of justice rechtsbeugung by ordering the issue of an unlawful demolition permit for a block of flats in on december the applicants head of division requested the applicant to substantiate his allegations in writing on december the applicant submitted several pages of written comments in which he repeated several times using bold characters his allegations that w had committed perversion of justice by ordering the issue of a demolition permit in without at the same time imposing compensation payments for the loss of housing space caused by the demolition according to the applicant w had ruthlessly pursued politicoeconomic interests he further submitted that all staff members of his subdivision considered that w had deliberately discredited their work furthermore w had unlawfully attempted to dissolve the subdivision thus putting at risk its staffs employment the statement made by w during the staff meeting had been degrading and cynical and had contained halftruths and lies w had not assumed any personal responsibility and did not show any concern for finding a socially acceptable solution to the problems arising from the dissolution of the subdivision by letter of march the municipality of dresden dismissed the applicant with effect from june the dismissal was primarily based on the applicants statement during the staff meeting according to the letter of dismissal the applicants accusations against w had been unjustified by making these accusations in front of a large number of staff members and representatives of the staff committee and of the trade union the applicant had damaged his superiors reputation and thus irrevocably destroyed the mutual trust which was necessary for effective cooperation it was further observed that the applicant had not availed himself of the possibility of submitting his concerns to his superior or to the mayor finally it was noted that the applicant had been reprimanded for disloyal conduct on two previous occasions on july a local newspaper published a letter to the editor in which the applicant expressed the opinion that the deputy mayor w lacked any competence for resolving problems relating to housing issues by judgment of may the dresden labour court arbeitsgericht established that the employment contract had not been terminated by the dismissal since this could not be justified under section of the unfair dismissal act kündigungsschutzgesetz see relevant domestic law below the labour court did not find it necessary to decide whether the applicants allegations had been correct as they were in any event covered by the applicants right to freedom of expression on january the saxon labour court of appeal landesarbeitsgericht dismissed the appeal lodged by the municipality of dresden on november the federal labour court bundesarbeitsgericht upon the municipalitys appeal on points of law quashed the judgment of january and remitted the case to the labour court of appeal no azr under the caselaw of the federal labour court gross insults directed against the employer or the employers representative which constituted a serious violation of the concerned persons honour could justify dismissal on grounds relating to the employees conduct in order to establish the seriousness of the violation of honour it had to be established whether the applicants allegations were based on objective facts account also had to be taken of whether the criticism had been made among staff members or whether other persons had been present finally it had to be considered that employees of the public service had to respect specific obligations under their code of conduct the federal labour court confirmed that the right to freedom of expression always had to be taken into account when assessing inappropriate language in a workplace context and that the applicants allegations fell within the scope of his right to freedom of expression accordingly the court had to weigh this right against the protected legal interest with which there had been an interference the federal labour court considered that the court of appeal when weighing the competing interests had failed to establish correctly the seriousness of the applicants allegations and of the violation of the deputy mayors personality rights under the criminal code perversion of justice was a crime subject to up to five years imprisonment in case of a criminal conviction under this provision a deputy mayor would automatically lose his office the conduct of a public service employee had to be measured against a stricter yardstick than that of an employee in the private sector in particular the employee was under an obligation to behave in such a way as not to interfere with his public employers reputation under the professional code of conduct the employee had to exercise special restraint when openly criticising a superiors decisions a public allegation of perversion of justice directed against a superior in particular if it was unfounded very seriously violated the superiors personality rights and interfered as a rule with the employees professional duties accordingly in order duly to weigh the competing interests in the light of the right to freedom of expression the court of appeal would have to examine whether the applicants allegations had been justified or not it had further to be taken into account that the allegations had been made during a staff meeting while it was true that criticism made in this context could occasionally be exaggerated or polemic without giving the employer a ground for dismissal this right was limited by the obligation not to disturb peace in the office it had to be taken into account in the applicants favour that the staff meeting concerned the suppression of the applicants field of work and that the atmosphere had been rather tense however this did not justify neglecting the fact that the allegation of perversion of justice did not concern the subject matter of the staff meeting but a single incident which dated back several years and had not been mentioned by the applicant since the applicant did not make use of the possibility of informing the mayor about his legal concerns regarding the deputy mayors decision at the time of the staff meeting the decision dated back such a long time that an attempt to put the decision into question must have lacked the prospect of success accordingly it appeared that the applicants statement was rather aimed at attacking the deputy mayor it had also to be taken into account that the statement was made in the presence of persons who were not necessarily bound by confidentiality accordingly there was the risk that the applicants allegations would leak out of this close circle and be made known to a wider public the federal labour court finally observed that the applicants statement had to be seen in the wider context of his conduct and that the applicant had further exacerbated the conflict by the content of his written comments on november the saxon labour court of appeal quashed the judgment of the labour court dated may and dismissed the applicants action the labour court of appeal considered that the applicants dismissal had been justified because the applicant in his statement at the staff meeting and in his subsequent written submissions had seriously insulted and slandered the deputy mayor by accusing him of perversion of justice based on a detailed examination of the factual and legal situation in the labour court of appeal considered that the decision taken by the deputy mayor at that time had been lawful the applicants written submissions of december demonstrated that he was not willing to accept and implement politically legitimate decisions if they concerned sanctions for misuse of property by house owners the content of the letter to the editor see paragraph above contained value judgments which did not amount to insult however the deputy mayor could not be expected to maintain daily cooperation with the applicant after reading this letter in which he had been described as incompetent the labour court of appeal further observed that the applicant had not revised his opinion during the proceedings the labour court of appeal further considered that the employer did not have any milder means at its disposal in particular it would not have been sufficient to reprimand the applicant and to transfer him to another working position the court observed that the applicant was currently working in the public procurement office and that there was no negative information about his conduct this was temporary employment which the applicant had obtained by court order in separate proceedings the applicant had expressed his readiness to accept employment even at a lower level however the labour court of appeal considered that the applicant would not have changed his attitude without his dismissal from office the municipality could reasonably expect that the applicant would have carried on with his selfrighteous attitude if he had not been dismissed the labour court of appeal finally considered that the applicants chances of finding new employment were low nevertheless the employers interest in terminating the employment outweighed the applicants interests on march the federal labour court dismissed the applicants request to be granted leave to appeal on points of law on august the federal constitutional court refused to entertain the applicants constitutional complaint no bv r without providing reasons ii relevant domestic law section of the collective agreement for public service employees in the eastern part of germany bundesangestelltentarifvertrag ost bato provides that an employee who has worked a minimum period of five years in the public service may be dismissed with three months notice section of the unfair dismissal act provides that termination of an employment relationship by the employer is unlawful if it is socially unjustified under section of that act termination is socially unjustified unless it is inter alia based on grounds relating to the employee himself or to his conduct article of the criminal code provides that a judge another public official or an arbitrator who in conducting or deciding a legal matter perverts the course of justice for the benefit or to the detriment of a party shall be liable to imprisonment from one to five years article of the code provides that unlawful acts punishable by a minimum sentence of one years imprisonment are considered to be felonies verbrechen iii council of europe documents the model code of conduct for public officials appended to recommendation no r of the committee of ministers to member states on codes of conduct for public officials as far as relevant reads as follows article the public official should carry out his or her duties in accordance with the law and with those lawful instructions and ethical standards which relate to his or her functions the public official should act in a politically neutral manner and should not attempt to frustrate the lawful policies decisions or actions of the public authorities article the public official has the duty to serve loyally the lawfully constituted national local or regional authority the public official is expected to be honest impartial and efficient and to perform his or her duties to the best of his or her ability with skill fairness and understanding having regard only for the public interest and the relevant circumstances of the case the public official should be courteous both in his or her relations with the citizens he or she serves as well as in his or her relations with his or her superiors colleagues and subordinate staff the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that his dismissal from office violated his right to freedom of expression as provided in article of the convention which so far as relevant reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence the government contested that argument a admissibility the court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the applicants submissions the applicant asserted that the staff meeting was limited to the employees of the housing office and according to the relevant domestic law was not public in order to encourage employees to speak out trade union representatives could attend but were obliged to respect confidentiality the staff meeting was therefore the place determined by law to express internal criticism according to the applicant the content of the criticism expressed by him was entirely workrelated it was not meant to reach the public but to denounce an internal grievance referring to the caselaw of the federal labour court the applicant submitted that under domestic law the expression of an erroneous legal opinion may not lead to sanctions by the employer he therefore had the right to comment on the unlawfulness of ws decision insofar as he used the expression perversion of justice this implied any kind of breach of law intentional or negligent but had by no means to be understood as an accusation that w fulfilled all elements of crime prescribed in article of the criminal code see paragraph above the applicant further submitted that ws decision was also related to the dissolution of the subdivision at that time the deputy mayor had already initiated a policy of rollback towards the regulations on misuse of housing property finally the applicant views the dismissal as disproportionate his transfer to a different workplace which was not under the supervision of deputy mayor w would have been sufficient to resolve the conflict the municipality of dresden employed workers in seven departments each of them led by a different deputy mayor it would therefore have been possible to continue to employ the applicant without risking another confrontation with w between and the applicant was employed in another field of work and proved to be a reliable employee furthermore at the time of his dismissal the applicant was years old his work experience was of limited value on the job market and he therefore had not found any possibility save the employment between and to be integrated into the job market and lived on unemployment benefits the governments submissions the government agreed that there had been an interference with the applicants rights under article of the convention but regarded this interference as justified to pursue the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or the rights of others and to prevent the dissemination of confidential information referring widely to the arguments of the federal labour court and the subsequent judgment of the labour court of appeal of november the government stressed that the applicants primary motivation was to defame the mayor personally they argued that the applicant could not use the term perverting the course of justice without distinction as a lay person not working in a legal area might do furthermore the applicant had not undertaken any measures to resolve the dispute in this matter had no relevance whatsoever to the staff meeting in any case a staff meeting did not serve to monitor the general administrative conduct of the agency it could only address matters which had a direct impact on the agency or its employees the government concluded that the municipality of dresden had been entitled to assume that the applicants relationship with the deputy mayor w personally was not only strained but that overall there was no longer an expectation of loyalty and acceptance towards future supervisors or towards the city administration as employer finally the government added that there had been no possibility of a less severe option than the dismissal of the applicant and that the applicants nonobjectionable conduct during the temporary continuation of his employment had probably only occurred because his employment had been terminated assessment by the court the court reiterates that the protection of article of the convention extends to the workplace in general and to the public service in particular see among other authorities wojtas kaleta v poland no july guja v moldova gc no february fuentes bobo v spain no february ahmed and others v the united kingdom no september accordingly the protection of article also applies to the statements made by the applicant during the staff meeting on december it follows that the dismissal from office which was primarily based on these statements interfered with the applicants right to freedom of expression the court observes that the dismissal from office was based on section of the collective agreement for public service employees in connection with section of the unfair dismissal act and was thus prescribed by law within the meaning of article of the convention furthermore the applicants dismissal pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the deputy mayors honour and a professional work environment at the housing office thus the reputation and rights of others it remains to be determined whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society the court reiterates the basic principles laid down in its judgments concerning article which have been summarised as follows see among other authorities mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no july matúz v hungary no october vogt v germany gc no september i freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society as set forth in article this freedom is subject to exceptions which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article iii the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts the court further reiterates that employees have a duty of loyalty reserve and discretion to their employer this is particularly so in the case of the public service since the very nature of public service requires its employees to be bound by a duty of loyalty and discretion compare guja cited above see also articles and of the model code of conduct for public officials adopted by the committee of ministers paragraph above furthermore under the courts caselaw the signalling by an employee in the public sector of illegal conduct or wrongdoing in the workplace should in certain circumstances enjoy protection this may be called for where the employee concerned is the only person or part of a small category of persons aware of what is happening at work and is thus best placed to act in the public interest by alerting the employer or the public at large see guja cited above and heinisch v germany no july the courts task is therefore to determine whether in the light of the case as a whole the sanction imposed on the applicant was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient compare palomo sánchez and others v spain gc nos and september fuentes bobo cited above it has to take into account the circumstances of the case including inter alia the applicants motivation for his statement its legal and factual base the actual wording and its possible interpretations the impact it had on the employer and the sanction inflicted on the applicant turning to the circumstances of the instant case with regard to the applicants motivation the court observes that at the time of the staff meeting the deputy mayors decision dated back almost two years moreover it appears that the applicant addressed his concerns neither to ws superior nor to the public prosecution the applicant himself claims that he did not want to address the public finally the issue was not closely related to any subject on the agenda of the staff meeting the court further notes that the federal labour court see paragraph above held that the applicants statement was not aimed at uncovering an unacceptable situation within the housing office but was rather motivated by the applicants personal misgivings about the deputy mayor arising from the prospect of the impending dissolution of his subdivision the current case has therefore to be distinguished from cases of whistleblowing an action warranting special protection under article of the convention in which an employee reports a criminal offence in order to draw attention to alleged unlawful conduct of the employer see heinisch cited above the court further observes that the saxon labour court of appeal on the basis of a thorough examination of the factual and legal situation at the time the impugned demolition permit had been issued considered that the decision taken by the deputy mayor had been lawful and the applicants accusations of perversion of justice unfounded the court considers that the applicant as the longserving head of the subdivision in charge of sanctioning misuse of housing property must have been wellacquainted with the legal background accordingly the court is not convinced that he acquitted himself of the obligation to verify carefully whether his allegations were accurate insofar as the applicant alleged that he had used the term perversion of justice in a colloquial way and therefore had only intended to say that the disputed action of had been unlawful without implying any intentions of w relevant under criminal law the court notes that the federal labour court found that the applicant as the head of a subdivision of a public authority dealing with legal issues was more adept in legal matters than the general public it is thus not unreasonable to assume that he should have been aware of the legal implication of the term perversion of justice in particular that it described an intentional abuse of public authority punishable with a minimum of one years imprisonment under article of the criminal code thus considered a felony under domestic law see paragraph above the court considers the unfounded allegation of a serious crime rather a defamatory accusation than a criticism in the interest of the public compare barfod v denmark no february and notes that the saxon labour court of appeal held in its judgment that the applicant had never withdrawn his allegation that w had committed this crime the court further observes that the applicant was given the opportunity to substantiate his allegations and that he repeated his accusations in written form more than a week after the staff meeting using the term perversion of justice several times in bold letters it follows that the dismissal was not only based on the applicants spontaneous statement during the meeting but also on a written statement he submitted after having been given time to reflect on the impact of his allegations see palomo sanchez and others cited above and de diego nafría v spain no march moreover if in doubt he had the opportunity to verify the legal significance of the term perversion of justice after the staff meeting with respect to the damage suffered by the authority the domestic courts found that the applicants accusations were not only likely to damage the deputy mayors reputation but also to interfere seriously with the working atmosphere within the housing office by undermining the deputy mayors authority the court observes that the accusations were not made publicly but during a staff meeting it notes however that the federal labour court when assessing the impact of the applicants statement considered that not all persons present at the staff meeting had been staff members and that there had been a risk that the applicants allegations would be made known to a wider public the court acknowledges that this intensified the potential impact of the accusations as well as the fact that the crime in question was a felony and as such the attack on ws reputation was even graver for these reasons the case must be distinguished from the case of rubin v latvia no january in which the domestic courts had not established that insults had been made and the applicant based his accusations on facts undisputed by the parties involved the court further notes that the applicant did not act in the context of an ongoing labour conflict compare and contrast palomo sanchez and others cited above nor submit any trade union activity on the issues at stake nor claim to be a union activist himself the court observes that the applicants dismissal from office constituted the heaviest sanction possible under labour law compare heinisch cited above it further notes that the saxon labour court of appeal in its judgment of november held that the applicants nonobjectionable conduct at another working place within the municipality of dresden was likely to be due to his dismissal and the pending proceedings the court further observes that the labour court of appeal acknowledged the applicants difficulty in finding new employment at the age of but still found the dismissal necessary because the applicants behaviour also during the proceedings before the domestic courts had shown that the applicant was likely to reproach the deputy mayors conduct in the presence of other employees and in public its view that the municipality could rightfully fear that the applicant would return to his past behaviour if reinstated taking into account further elements such as the applicants written comments and his letter to the editor is not unreasonable and as such is acceptable under the convention having regard to the above considerations and in particular to the fact that the federal labour court and the saxon labour court of appeal in its subsequent judgment both carefully examined the case in the light of the applicants right to freedom of expression the court considers relevant and sufficient the domestic courts reasons for deciding that the applicants right to freedom of expression did not outweigh the public employers interest in his dismissal the dismissal can not therefore be considered to amount to a disproportionate interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression the court concludes therefore that there has been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rules of court claudia westerdiek mark

35,in and lives in kyiv he was represented by ms ll pankratova a lawyer practising in the same city the government were represented by their agent most recently mr i lishchyna the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows background to the casethe article of march the applicant is a journalist at the material time he was working for the national weekly analytical newspaper dzerkalo tyzhnya which had a circulation of approximately copies on march in a series of publications written by the applicant an article entitled black triad nothing else matters in the case чорна трійка все інше справи не стосується was published in the above newspaper on march it was published on the newspapers website in the article the author referred to a previous publication of his and noted that in a certain case no which had been pending for some time before the courts and had at least twice been remitted to the lower courts a judgment had been taken on the basis of a forged copy of a document the original of which was part of the materials in the case file in a certain set of criminal proceedings the donetsk commercial court of appeal had nevertheless delivered its judgment on the basis of the forged copy the applicant went on describing what he called a system for obtaining a required result in order to get the result a particular law firm had been contacted the law firm had been paid a substantial fee by the plaintiff but had then surprisingly taken no further part in the proceedings in which the plaintiff a state enterprise had been represented by its own lawyers as for the courts they had carefully referred the case up to the higher commercial court which in turn had taken an excessively long time over the proceedings before finally remitting the case to a lower court for the absence of a copy of the decision complained of in the meantime the plaintiff had been liquidated which according to the applicant had allowed numerous wrongdoings to be hidden the full text of the article reads as follows in may last year dt dzerkalo tyzhnya no may published an article entitled how the court validated the copy of the document while the original document was missing як суд легалізував копію при відсутності оригіналу it discussed an unprecedented legal incident in the history of ukrainian justice that occurred when based on a highly doubtful copy in terms of the quality of the print and even more in terms of the content of a certain document a guarantee letter the court delivered a judgment that has been challenged by the respondent for four years now incidentally it was challenged at the same time as the presidential decree on the formation of appellate courts in ukraine was issued for one simple reason according to the respondent they have never issued a document with such a registration number to the plaintiff and have not provided any guarantees nevertheless since there are many different methods to make any conflict of interest palatable for themis the case has become a kind of symbol of dignity and a fetish of the shortcomings of the very structural judicial system adopted from the developed democracies which was based on a system tainted with sovietness совковостью and telephone law formation of the principles of independence of the third branch of power in our state paragraph dt has repeatedly described the vicissitudes of the litigation and mutual claims of the parties in the dispute in the three years before the publication of the abovementioned article case no underwent two rounds of court proceedings from the court of first instance to the judgment of the supreme court of ukraine there was also a third round under newly discovered circumstances in the scope of criminal proceedings instigated against the limited liability company n which stole from a state transport shipping enterprise intertrans something it was not specified what worth more than million hryvnias uah and then vanished without a trace the prosecutors office discovered the original of the controversial guarantee letter it turned out that the guarantee letter referred to by the plaintiff intertrans had been provided by the defendant to a completely different enterprise which had initially been stated by the party at all the court hearings however for some reason that was never taken into account the donetsk commercial court of appeal could have set the record straight but instead having established the existence of the guarantee letter in the criminal case file it delivered a decision based on a copy of that letter accordingly this author naturally asked the question i wonder what the commercial justice system will come up with this time in order to protect the state enterprisestructure that caused substantial pecuniary damage to the state paragraph reality has surpassed the most daring expectations further immersion in the twilight of this dark and shady subject of how commercial disputes in the donetsk region are resolved gives you the impression that a system exists that is quite primitive in terms of the scheme and reliable in terms of efficiency for obtaining the desired result in almost any case at the same time one gets the impression that the essence of the problem does not matter at all to its facilitators what is important is that the customer usually the plaintiff comes to the right place at the right time paragraph as a rule this is a law firm to which large amounts are legally transferred for legal services subsequently it is difficult to follow what active role the law firm takes in the court proceedings instead the representatives appear or as in the case of intertrans which for some unknown reason paid a fee of uah to the mysterious i are content with the participation of their own lawyers in the court proceedings throughout the entire process the case is considered by a host of servants of commercial justice in the donetsk region who pass it on with care and concern up to the higher commercial court of ukraine paragraph so when the original copy and then an additional document proving the forgery of the copy were discovered it became clear that it was no longer necessary to discuss the adversarial nature of the arguments but the falsification and intent which is not the subject matter of commercial disputes but of criminal investigations and again just the facts the higher commercial court of ukraine hccu made its mark once again contrary to part of article of the commercial procedural code of ukraine which provides for a onemonth period for examining a request for review of a court decision due to newly discovered circumstances the hccu delayed examining the case for nine months paragraph first the hccu received all the necessary materials from the donetsk court of appeal and appointed the day of the hearing but when the parties arrived at kopylenka st in kyiv they discovered that nothing was going to happen apparently the document was missing accordingly the hccu immediately established as it can be seen from the content of the cassation appeal the defendant challenged the ruling of the donetsk commercial court of appeal of june however the case file does not contain the contested ruling or any mentions thereof therefore case no must be remitted to the donetsk regional commercial court for proper registration in accordance with the requirements of the law in force so a new date was set and the donetsk regional commercial court was assigned with a task although its clear that it was meant for the donetsk commercial court of appeal but these are different state institutions arent they or maybe it has been a single structure for a long time a fact the judiciary of the largest commercial court of first instance in ukraine still does not even suspect but which is clear to kyiv and thats why they wrote it paragraph in short so far no one has bothered to answer where the ruling was and where it suddenly came from in the materials of case no they quietly sweep it under the carpet although most likely it wasnt an accident and they were achieving a specific task to delay consideration of the case until february indeed on that very day in accordance with order no of september of the ministry of transport in order to increase the efficiency of the use of state property the liquidation of intertrans was completed and it was removed from the united state register of enterprises and organisations of ukraine everything turned out as planned the court hearing took place after the specified date and the case file has not yet been returned from kyiv to donetsk note this is only a part of the state problem inherited from the previous leadership of the ministry of transport informed sources claim that the liquidation of intertrans made it possible to bury amounts much larger than the unjustly recovered funds from ibank based on the copy however this is yet another topic worthy of journalistic attention paragraph the article ended with the following paragraphs the eighth and ninth paragraphs by the way ch the managing director of jointstock company d conducted an investigation and came to the conclusion that there was an organised group operating in the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal in a letter to the head of the parliamentary subcommittee on combating organised crime and corruption in lawenforcement bodies and courts he set out the names of the members of the group and the detailed mode of operation of the whole scheme as proof ch cited case no in which he had been a defendant against the state enterprise ugolnaya kompaniya krasnolimanskaya concerning the invalidation of a contract as well as a number of other similar disputes which were subsequently quashed by the supreme court of ukraine the judges well known from case no appear everywhere paragraph the reason for my address to the verkhovna rada said ch was case no while the case was going through all the judicial instances i felt the pressure of the system lets say an interested client comes knocking and asks for assistance with a case that will clearly lose they recommend that he goes to law firm l then the contract is concluded with the client the money is transferred and the claim is prepared then in spite of any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge after that the case is always decided in the clients favour if another party lodges an appeal a socalled black triad exists which embraces the principle that nothing else matters in the case most people who have been through these two judicial instances give up they lose their faith in justice and do not apply anywhere else they say to themselves they are all tarred with the same brush paragraph interim injunction proceedings on april judges a c d e b and f applied to the voroshylovsky district court of donetsk city hereinafter the district court for the application of preventive measures and securing of evidence заява про вжиття запобіжних заходів та про забезпечення доказів they argued that the article of march black triad nothing else matters in the case contained a negative evaluation of the activity of the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal and was not based on any facts the style of the article was extremely negative in particular the claimants indicated that the following statements did not correspond to reality an organised group the detailed mode of operation of the whole scheme the pressure of the system assistance with a case that will clearly lose in spite of any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge about existence of a black triad and the principle of nothing else matters in the case the applicant had not verified the information in question and had thus failed to comply with his professional duties according to the claimants the publication in question breached the honour dignity and professional reputation of the abovementioned courts their management and the judges in particular it was noted that judges e c d and f had examined case no which was mentioned in the publication and therefore the article had caused them nonpecuniary damage similar damage had been caused to a the head of the donetsk commercial court of appeal who was responsible for the organisational management of the court and b the deputy head of the donetsk regional commercial court who according to distribution of duties performed management of the structural unit that included the judges who had examined case no the claimants stated that they would lodge a defamation claim for damages against the newspaper the applicant and ch they eventually did so on april and august see paragraph below as the article in question contained elements of an interview ie the last paragraph containing eventually the majority of the untrustful information referring inter alia to articles and of the civil code of ukraine the ccu see paragraph below they argued that their rights were being infringed while the article was still available online and requested its removal under article of the code of civil procedure the ccp see paragraph below the claimants request was for an order against the editorial board of the newspaper to remove the article from the newspapers website in addition they also asked for the attachment of the newspapers property the property of the applicant and that of ch in order to secure their claims finally they asked that the newspaper provide the documents their editorial board and the applicant had used to verify the information published in the article on april the district court ordered the editorial board of dzerkalo tyzhnya to remove the article from the newspapers website in its oneandahalfpage decision the court merely reiterated the content of the claimants request the court then referred to article of the ccp which set out the possible injunction measures for securing a claim and noted that the request should be granted in part providing no reasoning or assessment of the claimants position the applicant the newspaper and ch appealed against this decision noting inter alia that an interim injunction such as taking an article down from a website was not prescribed under domestic law and furthermore that the court had referred to article of the ccp which provided for interim measures after lodging a claim and not before they further noted that the court had failed to provide any reasoning in particular they argued that the article had not named a single judge and that therefore the claimants had failed to prove that their rights had been breached on august the donetsk regional court of appeal upheld the district courts decision having reiterated the claimants request and quoted article of the ccu the court noted the following the challenged article carries information which is disseminated on the internet since such information is accessible to the general public and is difficult to control the removal of the article from the website similar to a property attachment under paragraph of article of the ccp is the only measure that would ensure protection of the individual right pending examination of the case on the merits the firstinstance court relied on article of the ccp which provides for securing a claim by prohibiting certain actions such reference is erroneous since no claim had been lodged at the time when the ruling was delivered however this shortcoming can not serve as a ground for quashing the courts ruling as the request had been examined on the merits correctly the applicant appealed in cassation arguing that article of the ccp did not prescribe any interim measure such as removing an article from a website he further stated that the court had failed to provide any reasoning for its decision and that the claimants had not provided any evidence to support their argument that their rights had been infringed some two and a half years later on january the kyiv court of appeal sitting as a cassation court rejected the applicants appeal against the decisions of april and august for lack of evidence of breaches of the law the above judicial decisions were enforced and the impugned article was removed from the newspapers website on an unspecified date but no later than august subsequent publication on march a the head of the donetsk commercial court of appeal and b a former deputy head of the donetsk regional commercial court sent a letter to the chief editor of dzerkalo tyzhnya demanding a retraction of the information published in the article of march they provided a text to be published for that purpose the letter was received at the office of the newspaper on march on april following the interim injunction issued by the voroshyloskyy district court of donetsk see paragraphs above dzerkalo tyzhnya published an article entitled black triad to be continued чорна трійка далі буде indicating a and b as the authors of the letter requesting the retraction the article which apparently was a summary of the text of their letter of march reads as follows every court case is a complicated tangle of antagonistic interests of the parties and its settlement irrespective of the outcome will always leave one of the parties unsatisfied even when a party understands the lack of grounds for its appeal against the court decision very often only the requirement of paying the court and legal fees would stop it from lodging such an appeal most people naturally consider all decisions in their favour as lawful and fair and vice versa everyone who has acted as a judge in any dispute knows the loser will most probably regard the decision as unfair and biased on march dt dzerkalo tyzhnya published an article by anatoliy yeremenko entitled black triad nothing else matters in the case the article raised very important and relevant problems for modern ukrainian society it cites the story of the managing director of jointstock company d ch who allegedly discovered unlawful activity on the part of judges of the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal however many were surprised by chs hard feelings towards the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal indeed given the number of cases won by jointstock company d and the strength of those cases it should have been more likely for his opponents in those cases to have had reasons to feel that way take for example the decision in case no according to which the claimant jointstock company d was awarded uah however another case no is cited as an example in the article for some unknown reason the request of ds managing director under articles to of the code of commercial procedure of ukraine to have his case examined by a bench of judges being disregarded was not mentioned in the newspaper article we shall explain for those who are not lawyers that these articles provide for the examination of cases by a bench of judges in a local commercial court where their category and complexity so requires however ch based his request exclusively on the necessity to avoid any pressure on the court by the opposite party which is not a ground for allowing the examination of the case by a bench of judges therefore if we follow the letter of the law the court should have rejected chs request as unlawful however having taken into consideration the category of the case and the extensive number of circumstances to be examined the court allowed his request it follows that the claimant is either unable to understand the text of the law but takes the liberty to criticise court decisions or he consciously provoked the court to reject the request in order to have an excuse to complain later about the courts bias but despite the positive decision about the composition of the court in case no ch asserts that then in spite of any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge it is easy to remark that such a conclusion contradicts the facts as well as the conclusion that the case is always decided in the clients favour and that there is a socalled black triad in the court of appeal even more offensive is his final conclusion that they are all tarred with the same brush the only lawful way to receive a decision in your favour is to act within the law and to provide sufficient arguments and valid evidence but some it is unlikely that they could be called lawabiding citizens stop at nothing if the end justifies the means why not try all of them the easiest from a practical point of view but we emphasise not effective and the least ethical way to convince the court to adopt the required decision is to issue a warning in a manner akin to it is better not to mess with me by manipulating public opinion such people try to influence the decisions of public servants including judges indeed hardly anybody would wish to be associated with the black triad currently the donetsk regional commercial court is examining the case in which d is one of the parties so is the tragical farce of ch not an attempt to scare the court and to influence its future judgment suggesting that the black triad article could be continued with the family names of all the judges with firm beliefs and they could later try to prove their integrity publicly it is well known the higher a persons social status the more society is inclined towards believing in the most absurd gossip about them so they have to prove their innocence therefore the negative evaluation of the functioning of the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal was given in the absence of any merit in particular there is no reason to believe that there is an organised group involved in unlawful activity operating in the abovementioned courts there is no practice of assisting interested clients in obtaining positive decisions in cases that will clearly lose in the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal furthermore the employees of these courts never recommend particular law firms it is also untrue that despite any existing procedure the cases are given to the right judge in order to deliver a decision in the case in favour of the client the court does not and can not have clients and decisions in the cases mentioned in the articles were taken after impartial examination of all the circumstances of the cases and the evidence submitted by the parties there are no grounds to conclude that most people who went through the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal gave up and lost their faith in justice and that they do not apply anywhere else on may the claimants sent another letter to the chief editor of dzerkalo tyzhnya demanding that the newspaper print a retraction stressing that their previous request had not been addressed adequately since the publication had been printed without a mention in the title of the word retraction and that it had contained only summarised elements of their letter of march on may the chief editor of dzerkalo tyzhnya replied that the above demand was groundless before the examination of the respective claim by the courts and the pronouncement of the respective judgment defamation proceedings on april and august the same claimants see paragraph above lodged defamation claims against the applicant ch and the editorial board of dzerkalo tyzhnya they claimed that their professional reputation honour and dignity had been damaged by the article in question according to them the statements contained in the article had undermined the authority of the judiciary in their updated claim the judges asked the court to recognise the following statements as defamatory there was an organised group operating in the donetsk regional commercial court and in the donetsk commercial court of appeal that ch had discovered a detailed mode of operation of the whole scheme the pressure of the system an interested client comes knocking and asks for assistance with a case that will clearly lose they recommend that he goes to law firm l then the contract is concluded with the client the money is transferred and the claim is prepared then despite any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge after that the case is always decided in the clients favour if another party lodges an appeal a socalled black triad exists which embraces the principle that nothing else matters in the case and they are all tarred with the same brush they further asked the court to order the editorial board of dzerkalo tyzhnya to publish a retraction of the above statements and to order the applicant and ch to pay ukrainian hryvnias uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage to each claimant they noted that the newspaper had partly restored their rights by allowing them to exercise their right to reply to the allegations in the impugned article and by removing the article from their website in his response to the claim the applicant insisted that the statements concerned contained information important to the general public and the sources of the information were ch and chs letter to the parliamentary subcommittee he further noted that he had duly verified that the letter had indeed been submitted to parliament and that it was a ground for a related inquiry by the lawenforcement services at the same time he stated that chs remarks were in line with the results of his own journalistic investigations in respect of cases nos and which were based on the case files of those cases the applicant considered that since he had received the information from an official of an organisation he was relieved from liability for published material by virtue of section of the press act lastly the applicant noted that the claimants names had never been mentioned in the article and that there were at least twelve other judges who had examined the case in issue in the donetsk regional commercial court but who had not lodged a defamation claim he also referred to his previous article of may in which a and c had been named but against which they had never initiated defamation proceedings in support of his arguments the applicant attached inter alia chs letter to the parliamentary subcommittee the case files of several cases he had examined in the context of his investigation including case no and his previous articles on the topic in question on an unspecified date the applicant and ch also lodged counterclaims the applicant stated that before initiating defamation proceedings and requesting the interim injunction a c d e b and f had illegally obtained his personal information including his name and contact details he asked the court to find such actions unlawful ch asked the court to determine that the information contained in the judges letter to the newspaper published on april see paragraph above was untrue on october the petrovskyy local court examined the case on the merits having analysed the eighth and ninth paragraphs of the article in question the court allowed the judges claim in part the court concluded that the statements contained in those paragraphs were defamatory had presented a distorted view of reality and were not based on actual facts and their publication had resulted in nonpecuniary damage being inflicted on all the claimants the relevant parts of the courts judgment read as follows the information contained in the relevant paragraphs of the article did not correspond to reality and tarnished the honour dignity and reputation of the claimants in view of the following at the court hearing the applicant confirmed that in the eighth and ninth paragraphs of the article he had used information provided by ch including the letter to the parliamentary subcommittee along with chs succinct commentary which disclosed elements of an interview the respondent ch confirmed that the author had used the information provided by him in the eighth and ninth paragraphs of the impugned article upon analysis of the ninth paragraph of the article it is established that it was published in the form of an interview pursuant to section of the copyright and related rights act the copyright of a recorded interview is to be regarded as coauthorship the interviewee and the interviewer are coauthors of the interview the court considers that the applicant and ch are coauthors of the article in the letter addressed to the head of the parliamentary subcommission on combating organised crime and corruption ch stated that an organised criminal group was operating in the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk regional court of appeal which on demand provided judgments and rulings required by clients he named the members of the group and described how it operated ch also sent this letter to the state security service and was informed that his allegations were being verified in response to an enquiry of the donetsk commercial court of appeal on april the administration of the security service of ukraine in the donetsk region reported that upon examination перевірки of chs allegations no proof of the existence and activities of such an organised criminal group in the abovementioned courts had been found therefore the relevant statements published in the eighth paragraph of the article had not been proved and accordingly they were untrue the article referred to chs letter to in which he directly mentioned a criminal organisation that existed in the abovementioned courts even though the article did not reproduce the content of that letter the statements in the eighth and ninth paragraphs suggested to the reader that the existence of a criminal group was being discussed in their description of the procedure for distributing and examining cases the coauthors of the article accused the judges of the above courts not only of violating bylaws but also of what could be interpreted as abuse of office and a miscarriage of justice both being criminal offences the expression organised group was used in the article in the criminal sense and was associated with a criminal offence committed by an organised group pursuant to article of the constitution of ukraine a person is presumed innocent of committing a crime until their guilt is proved in accordance with the law and established by a verdict of a court no such verdict has been delivered in respect of the claimants by any domestic court and therefore those statements were defamatory at the same time the court can not take into consideration the defendants arguments according to which at the court hearing they had provided evidence in support of their statement as to the existence of a special procedure for examining cases in view of the following as noted above the statements as to the existence of a special procedure for examining cases in the abovementioned courts constitute an accusation that a crime has been committed which must be proved by certain means in view of article of the constitution as to the presumption of innocence the above statements can be proved only by a verdict of a court which does not exist in respect of the claimants section of the press act provides that a journalist is exempted from liability for the publication of material that is untrue defames the honour and dignity of citizens and organisations infringes the rights and lawful interests of citizens or constitutes abuse of the freedom of the printed mass media and the rights of journalists if the information is contained in a reply to a request for access to official documents and to a request for written or oral information provided in accordance with the information act section of the information act provides that a request for access to official documents is a request addressed to relevant state authorities or its officials in order to examine the official documents since jointstock company d was not a state body and its managing director ch was not an official of a state authority his letter could not be considered an official document within the meaning of section of the press act and section of the information act under section of the information act value judgments are not subject to retraction or proof of veracity the information in the eighth and ninth paragraphs of the article particularly the following statements can be interpreted as containing factual information and thus they are not value judgments ch came to the conclusion that there was an organised group operating in the donetsk regional commercial court and in the donetsk commercial court of appeal an interested client comes knocking and asks for assistance with a case that will clearly lose they recommend that he goes to the law firm l then the contract is concluded with the client the money is transferred and the statement of claim is prepared then in spite of any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge after that the case is always decided in the clients favour if another party lodges an appeal a socalled black triad exists which embraces the principle that nothing else matters in the case by virtue of article of the ccu one of the elements of the offence is dissemination of information about a person which would enable an observer to deduce that it concerns a specific identifiable individual or at least that the person belongs to a group of people to whom such information pertains indication of the persons name is not obligatory for information to be considered as concerning a specific person if he or she is identifiable on the basis of other elements the claimants a c d and e are judges at the donetsk commercial court of appeal and b and f at the donetsk regional commercial court in addition a is a head of the donetsk commercial court of appeal and b used to be a deputy head of the donetsk regional commercial court in the article the authors assert the existence of an organised group in the abovementioned courts which has been found by this court to be inaccuratefalse this fact alone tarnishes the dignity honour and reputation of the managing officials of such courts namely a and bas proof of the existence of an organised group in the abovementioned courts the authors refer to case no having examined the case file of the above case the court established that b assigned f to examine case no f was a presiding judge at the firstinstance courts examination of this case and e c and d further examined this case in the court of appeal thus as a result of the publication of untrue information all of the above judges sustained nonpecuniary damage including b who at the material time was deputy head of the donetsk regional commercial court and was managing the court division comprising the judges who had examined the case at first instance a the head of donetsk commercial court of appeal who is responsible for the organisational management of the court where the case in issue was examined on appeal also sustained nonpecuniary damage the court dismisses the respondents arguments concerning the fact that the names of the claimants had not been mentioned since the coauthors of the article provided sufficient information to identify them in addition the information on judges examining the domestic cases was not restricted the copies of the court decisions had been sent to the parties and information about these judges could be known to an unlimitedunrestricted number of persons when setting a compensation to be paid to the claimants by the applicant and ch the court noted that the applicant was guilty to a lesser degree since it was ch who had provided him with the information however the applicant had failed to verify the information and had thus failed in his professional duties as set out in section of the press act the court ordered the editorial board of dzerkalo tyzhnya to publish a retraction of the statements contained in the eighth and ninth paragraphs of the article and the applicant to pay uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage to each of the claimants plus their legal uah per claimant and court fees uah per claimant in total the applicant was ordered to pay the equivalent of euros eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage and eur in respect of legal and court fees ch was ordered to pay uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage per claimant plus legal and court fees finally the court dismissed the applicants and chs counterclaims as unsubstantiated the applicant appealed against the judgment of october of the petrovskyy local court relying on the following arguments i the court had failed to substantiate the existence of the nonpecuniary damage by not giving concrete reasons for the effect the article had had on the claimants and their psychological health ii the court had failed to make a distinction between the facts and value judgments in this respect the applicant noted that the phrase tarred with the same brush was clearly a value judgment yet it had not been examined by the court separately and had been found defamatory as a part of the whole text iii the material in the case files of case no and a number of other cases were sufficient to conclude that the statements published in the article were true iv the court had failed to examine the existence of mens rea in the applicants actions v the court had gone beyond what had been claimed in the complaints and had found defamatory the wider content of the statements published in the article he referred to the fact that the court had relied on the full text of the eighth and ninth paragraphs instead of only the particular statements quoted by the claimants in their complaints for example the phrases ch concluded and most of the people and vi the amount of the court fees he had been ordered to pay to the claimants was excessive on january the donetsk regional court of appeal upheld the firstinstance courts judgment on the merits and modified it concerning legal and court fees reducing the court fees imposed on the applicant to the equivalent of eur the relevant parts of the appellate courts judgment read as follows it follows from the content of the impugned article that the respondent ch had conducted his own investigation and concluded that there was an organised group in the donetsk regional commercial court and donetsk regional court of appeal with reference to the letter of the head of the subcommittee of verkhovna rada naming the members of the group and the detailed mode of operation of the whole scheme there are references to cases no and the ninth paragraph contains a direct speech and it discusses on behalf of ch case no at the court hearing the respondents maintained that the information published as to the existence of an organised group in the courts in question was true they insisted that case no as well as other cases had been allocated by b and a to their judges in violation of the orders on specialisation of the courts composition they submitted the orders allocating the cases noting the breaches allegedly committed during the allocation of case no and others the court reasonably rejected the respondents arguments the allocation of cases in the courts in question is an internal matter for the court and such circumstances can not point to the existence of an organised group or functioning of a scheme with interested clients at the time the article was published the claimants had not been convicted or found liable of acts of corruption it follows from the certificates in the case files that all the claimants serve as judges at the courts in question in the article the claimants were accused of violating the law during the examination of commercial cases however such circumstances were not proved at the court hearing in support of their arguments the respondents referred to the allocation of the cases in violation of specialisation orders but they did not provide any factual data to prove the information published in the article in his cassation appeal the applicant reiterated his previous arguments and also noted that after reading chs letter he had conducted his own investigation and relying on the materials in the case files he considered that he had verified the respective information with due diligence by a final decision of november the kyiv court of appeal acting as a court of cassation rejected the applicants cassation appeal against the decisions of october and january the court did not provide any reasoning apart from the standard conclusion that the applicants

act to a request for access to official documents and to a request for written or oral information the information is a verbatim reproduction of official speeches of the officials of state organs organisations and associations of citizens the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the court decisions ordering the removal of the article from the website pending the examination of the defamation case and holding him liable for the publication of the impugned article had been in breach of article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the court notes that the complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merits general principlesa media and journalistic freedom of expression the general principles were reiterated in bédat v switzerland gc no march and more recently in editorial board of grivna newspaper v ukraine nos and april i freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society as set forth in article this freedom is subject to exceptions which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court iii the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts the court has consistently emphasised that the press plays an essential role in a democratic society although it must not overstep certain bounds regarding in particular protection of the reputation and rights of others its duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities information and ideas on all matters of public interest including those relating to justice not only does it have the task of imparting such information and ideas the public also has a right to receive them article of the convention protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed but also the form in which they are conveyed journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation see perna v italy gc no echr v with further references the court has observed that the protection afforded by article of the convention to journalists however is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism see bédat cited above the concept of responsible journalism is not confined to the contents of information which is collected andor disseminated by journalistic means this concept also embraces the lawfulness of the conduct of a journalist see pentikäinen v finland gc no echr b judges as the subjects of publications and the limits of acceptable criticism the general principles relating to maintaining the authority of the judiciary were summarised in morice v france gc no echr questions concerning the functioning of the justice system an institution that is essential for any democratic society fall within the public interest in this connection regard must be had to the special role of the judiciary in society as the guarantor of justice a fundamental value in a state governed by the rule of law it must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties it may therefore prove necessary to protect such confidence against gravely damaging attacks that are essentially unfounded especially in view of the fact that judges who have been criticised are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying the phrase authority of the judiciary includes in particular the notion that the courts are and are accepted by the public at large as being the proper forum for the resolution of legal disputes further that the public at large have respect for and confidence in the courts capacity to fulfil that function what is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire not only in the accused as far as criminal proceedings are concerned but also in the public at large nevertheless save in the case of gravely damaging attacks that are essentially unfounded bearing in mind that judges form part of a fundamental institution of the state they may as such be subject to personal criticism within the permissible limits and not only in a theoretical and general manner when acting in their official capacity they may thus be subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than ordinary citizens ibid as regards the level of protection of freedom of expression there is little scope under article of the convention for restrictions on debate on matters of public interest accordingly a high level of protection of freedom of expression with the authorities thus having a particularly narrow margin of appreciation will normally be accorded where the remarks concern a matter of public interest as is the case in particular for remarks on the functioning of the judiciary even in the context of proceedings that are still pending in respect of other defendants a degree of hostility and the potential seriousness of certain remarks do not obviate the right to a high level of protection of freedom of expression given the existence of a matter of public interest see paturel v france no december and morice cited above application of those principles regarding the injunction proceedingsa the parties submissionsi the applicant the applicant did not dispute the legitimate aim of the removal of the article from the website but submitted that the measure had not been prescribed by domestic law or necessary in a democratic society he stated that the domestic courts had failed to conduct any preliminary analysis as to whether the published information was true and based on facts or whether it had violated the rights of the judges who had requested the measureii the government the government did not contest that there had been an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression they maintained that the measure had been based on law namely articles and of the ccu section of the information act and section of the press act and that those provisions had been sufficiently accessible and clear they added that the interference had served the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and reputation of the judges and preserving the authority of the judiciary the government noted that the article in question had included expressions which after being analysed by the court in the main proceedings had been found to contain untrue information therefore given the public access to the article on the newspapers website the measure had served as the only way of protecting the rights of others before examination of the defamation case in view of the above the domestic court had been forced to interfere with the applicants right to freedom of expression by partially allowing the claimants request and the interference had been necessary in order to protect the rights and the reputation of othersb the courts assessmenti whether there has been an interference the court notes that it is not in dispute between the parties that the decisions of the domestic courts ordering the removal of the article in question from the newspapers website constituted an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expressionii whether the interference was prescribed by law the court notes that the first and most important requirement of article of the convention is that any interference by a public authority with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression should be lawful the first sentence of the second paragraph essentially envisages that any restriction on expression must be prescribed by law in order to comply with this requirement interference does not merely have to have a basis in domestic law the law itself must correspond to certain requirements of quality in particular a norm can not be regarded as a law unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct he must be able if need be with appropriate advice to foresee to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances the consequences which a given action may entail those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty whilst certainty is desirable it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances accordingly many laws are inevitably couched in terms which to a greater or lesser extent are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice see for example lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc nos and echr iv turning to the circumstances of the present case the court observes that the applicant challenged the lawfulness of the interference being of the view that an interim measure such as the removal of an article from a website had not been prescribed by the law at the material time the court notes at the outset that the interim injunction request had been lodged at least ten days before the defamation claim that followed and that the legal provisions expressly provided for a situation where an injunction request is lodged before the court in the absence of a pending case as to the domestic provisions on which the court of appeal relied when upholding the interim measure the court notes that it interpreted article of the ccp which relates to property attachment as encompassing an order to remove content from a website having regard to the broad terms in which that provision is framed it would appear capable of encompassing both print and digital content the court of appeal explicitly overruled the district courts reliance on article of the ccp which it considered erroneous furthermore article of the ccp explicitly provides for the possibility of requesting and ordering an interim injunction before the main claim is lodged having regard to the fact that the national courts are best placed for interpreting and applying rules of substantive and procedural law the court observes that it has no reason to call into question the interpretation and application of domestic law by the court of appeal in the present case the court also notes that the foreseeability requirement does not exclude the law from being partly left to the interpretation of the judges see for example kudrevičius and others v lithuania gc no and echr an individual can not argue that a legal provision lacks foreseeability simply because it is applied for the first time in his case see satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june the mere fact that a legal provision is capable of more than one construction does not mean that it does not meet the requirement of foreseeability see perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extracts therefore while it would have been preferable for the government to provide further information on the relevant caselaw of the domestic courts concerning the interpretation and application of the provisions in question particularly article of the ccp the court can proceed on the premise that the interference had a basis in domestic lawiii whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim the court is satisfied that the interference in question pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation of others and most importantly maintaining the authority of the judiciaryiv whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society the court notes that interim injunctions by their very nature are temporary measures which merely aim to provide provisional protection to the party concerned pending the examination of the claim on its merits in cases where the postponement of such measure until after a final decision on the merits would risk causing irreparable harm to the person seeking the injunction or where the judicial examination of the claim would otherwise be impeded see cumhuriyet vakfı and others v turkey no october while article of the convention does not prohibit interim injunctions even where they entail prior restraints on publication the apparent dangers inherent in such measures call for the most careful scrutiny by the court see editions plon v france no echr iv the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities basing themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article of the convention see among many others zana v turkey no november reports of judgments and decisions vii in addition the fairness of the proceedings and the procedural guarantees afforded are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with respect to the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention including a close examination of the procedural safeguards embedded in the system to prevent arbitrary encroachments upon the freedom of expression see association ekin v france no echr viii steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii lombardi vallauri v italy no october and igor kabanov v russia no february in the present case the claimants considering that the publication in question encroached on their dignity honour and reputation lodged a request for it to be removed from the newspapers website and also sought the attachment of the newspapers property see paragraph above the court notes firstly that the domestic court granted the request only insofar as it concerned the removal of the publication from the newspapers website and that no measures were sought or imposed in respect of the printed copies of the newspaper which contained the same publication and which could remain in circulation see paragraphs above in this regard it can be considered that the injunction did not put an end to the dissemination of the publication in all forms and was not of a sweeping nature see in contrast obukhova v russia no january therefore the fact that the publication was not available on the newspapers website pending the examination of the defamation case did not totally hamper the applicants ability to disseminate information and ideas the interference with the applicants freedom of expression was not therefore of a significant magnitude the court further notes that the request for interim measures was submitted on april nearly a month after the publication of the article on march in print and roughly three weeks after it was published on the newspapers website on march see paragraphs and above while it is true that there is no information about the exact date on which the claimants learned about the publication this must have happened before march the date on which they demanded its retraction and publication of their response therefore the article in question had already been freely available to the public for nearly a month news is a perishable commodity and to delay its publication even for a short period may well deprive it of all its value and interest see for example observer and guardian v the united kingdom november series a no the sunday times v the united kingdom no november series a no and association ekin cited above in the present case being available to the public for nearly a month before being removed and that only from the internet site and not from the free circulation it could be concluded that such removal did not undermine the very essence of the public debate the court is particularly conscious of the fact that issues covered by the article in question concerned the functioning of the justice system while those issues definitely constitute questions of public interest the debate on which enjoys the protection of article of the convention the court has on many occasions emphasised the special role in society of the judiciary which as the guarantor of justice a fundamental value in a lawgoverned state must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties it may therefore prove necessary to protect that confidence against destructive attacks which are essentially unfounded especially in view of the fact that judges who have been criticised are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no the court finds it a matter of concern that the court of first instance limited its reasoning in respect of the injunction to citing exhibits from the claimants request while the court of appeal looked to the dissemination of the information on the internet and considered that its temporary removal was the only measure which would protect the applicants interests pending examination of the case on the merits see paragraphs and above when reasoning is succinct it can make it difficult for the court to assess whether the national authorities duly balanced the parties interests at stake see cumhuriyet vakfı and others cited above at the same time the court is conscious of the fact that by their very nature rulings on interim measures are issued as a matter of urgency and can not always contain finely calibrated and detailed reasoning equivalent to that required in the main defamation proceedings the court finally points out that the interim injunction concerned the whole article despite the fact that the alleged damaging statements had been only in two paragraphs however the applicant never raised before the court of appeal and the cassation court the argument that the injunction could have been limited to two paragraphs of the publication in view of the above the court concludes that in the particular circumstances of the present case the necessary in a democratic society requirement contained in the second paragraph of article of the convention was met and the interim injunction can not be said to have constituted a disproportionate interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression accordingly there has been no violation of article of the convention on account of the domestic courts decisions in the injunction proceedings application of those principles regarding the defamation proceedingsa the parties submissionsi the applicant the applicant argued that he had thoroughly and diligently verified all the facts provided by ch and that the latter had supported those facts in the court proceedings he further noted that he had simply quoted chs statements containing the latters own evaluation of the situation in the courts in question and reported that ch had sent a letter regarding that situation to the head of the parliamentary subcommittee thus he had been held liable for the verbatim reproduction of a third partys opinion the applicant further stated that the burden of proving that chs statements were true was incompatible with exercising the right to freedom of expression referring to thorgeir thorgeirson v iceland june series a no lyashko v ukraine no august gazeta ukraina tsentr v ukraine no july and thoma v luxembourg no echr iii the applicant further argued that by virtue of section of the press act he was exempted from civil liability for reproducing verbatim official statements of the officials of state authorities organisations and associations of citizens he referred to article of the ccu according to which information provided by an official while on official duty was considered authentic and a person disseminating such information was not obliged to verify its authenticity and would not be held liable if such information was disproven see paragraph above the applicant considered that the above provisions were vague and their consequences had not been foreseeable to him since they did not clearly prescribe that the official in question could only be an official of a state body as the domestic courts held in his case see paragraph above he stated that as concerned the defamation proceedings there had been no legitimate aim for the interference with his rights under article of the convention since the true aim of the claimants had been to intimidate him as a journalist the applicant argued that the domestic courts had never examined the issue of the necessity and had not taken into account the public interest of the information published in the article the domestic courts had failed to examine the article as a whole and as part of a series of articles disclosing a miscarriage of justice by the commercial courts the applicant stated that at the time when the article had been published he had been unaware of the results of the examination conducted by the state security service which he had only found out about on april he had therefore had a sufficient factual basis for the critical evaluation of the facts in the impugned article the applicant observed that at the time of the publication of the impugned article there had been no public register of court decisions and that the parties to the proceedings who had received copies of the relevant decisions or who had known the judges examining the case formed a fairly limited circle of persons furthermore the case mentioned in the article had been examined by many more judges throughout all the rounds of proceedings however only six of them had lodged a defamation claim he therefore considered that the statement as to the information about the claimants being accessible to an unlimited number of people had been greatly exaggerated he maintained that the penalty of retraction ordered by the courts in the defamation proceedings had been disproportionate as the newspaper had already printed a refutation by publication of the letter of a and b and had taken down the impugned article from their website in compliance with the interim injunction the applicant reiterated that the press was one of the means by which politicians and public opinion could verify that judges were discharging their heavy responsibilities in a manner that was in conformity with the aim which was the basis of the task entrusted to them citing prager and oberschlick ii the government the government did not contest that there had been an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression they submitted however that it had been prescribed by law namely by sections and of the press act sections and of the information act and article of the ccu they further stated that this lawful interference had pursued the legitimate aims of the protection of the reputation or rights of others and of the authority and impartiality of the judiciary as to whether it had been necessary in a democratic society the government noted that the applicant had clearly been of the opinion that the statements published in the eighth and ninth paragraphs of the article had been facts and not value judgments this had been proved by the applicants stance in the domestic proceedings in which he had argued that the court should have examined the evidence in support provided by ch and in his application to the court in which he had maintained that he had thoroughly and diligently verified all the facts provided by ch in addition in his appeal of november the applicant had stated that the information provided by ch was trueaccurate since it had been provided by an official the government further considered that by virtue of article of the ccu see paragraph above one of the elements of the offence was dissemination of information about a person which would enable an observer to deduce that it concerned a specific identifiable individual or at least that the person belonged to a group of people to whom such information pertained indication of the persons name was not obligatory for information to be considered as concerning a specific person if he or she was identifiable on the basis of other elements in that respect they noted that the claimants worked as judges in the domestic courts explicitly mentioned in the article that the information about judges examining cases had not been restricted and copies had been sent to the parties in the dispute and thus an unrestricted number of people could have been aware of it the government reiterated that the courts the guarantors of justice whose role was fundamental in a state based on the rule of law had to enjoy public confidence they had accordingly to be protected from destructive attacks that were unfounded especially in view of the fact that judges were subject to a duty of discretion that precluded them from replying to criticism citing de haes and gijsels v belgium february reports i the government then referred to the domestic courts findings that the specific terms and statements used by the authors in the eighth and ninth paragraphs of the article had suggested criminal activity at the courts in question the government also referred to the case of vitrenko and others v ukraine dec no december in which the court had concluded that the term thief was not a mere value judgment but an untrue statement of fact since it ordinarily suggested involvement in criminal activities and therefore it was most likely that this would be the meaning understood by the public they also briefly referred to the petrovskyy local courts finding that the relevant paragraphs of the article contained elements of an interview and thus pursuant to section of the copyright and related rights act the applicant and ch as an interviewer and interviewee had coauthored the article in question they further noted without providing any further details or referring to any document that the local administration of the state security service of ukraine upon revision of information contained in the chs letter had later found no proof of the chs allegations as to the existence and activities of an organised criminal group in the courts in question therefore the factual statements had not been proved and accordingly they were untrue the government also noted that there were no grounds for exempting the applicant from liability under section of the press act since ch was not an official of a state body finally the government maintained that the above interference had also been proportionate as the domestic courts had allowed the claims only in part furthermore they had reduced the fine in respect of the court fees and fees for legal aid in addition the applicant had never challenged the amount of the damages awarded before the domestic courts they also submitted that the retraction penalty had been proportionate since providing an opportunity to rebut the accusations in the same forum where they had been made could reasonably be considered to be in line with the principles established in the courts caselaw they referred to vitrenko and others cited aboveb the courts assessmenti whether there has been an interference the court finds that holding the applicant liable for the publication of the impugned article constituted an interference with his right to freedom of expression it is also not in dispute between the parties the court further notes that the applicant a journalist was held civilly liable for an article published in a newspaper the interference must therefore be seen in the context of the essential role of a free press in ensuring the proper functioning of a democratic society see among many other authorities lindon otchakovsky laurens and july cited above ii whether the interference was prescribed by law the court notes that the government and the domestic courts in their decisions in the defamation proceedings relied on sections and of the press act sections and of the information act and article of the ccu see paragraphs and above those provisions envisaged both the penalty of retraction of inaccurate information and compensation in respect of damage caused thereby the court considers therefore that the interference at issue was prescribed by law namely the relevant provisions of the press act and information act see paragraphs and above and that the applicants submissions regarding alleged lack of clarity on some of the relevant points see paragraph above concern questions which may arise in the analysis of the interferences necessity in a democratic societyiii whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim the domestic courts deciding on claims that the publication of the relevant excerpts of the article had infringed the claimants reputation as well as the authority and impartiality of the judiciary at large relied on the law protecting individuals from defamation and prescribing liability for defamation of the honour and dignity of others the court accepts that the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression pursued the legitimate aims of protection of the reputation or the rights of others and maintaining the authority of the judiciary see paragraph above it remains to be determined whether that interference was necessary in a democratic societyiv necessary in a democratic societyα relevant caselaw principles regarding the defamation proceedings in order to determine whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society the court must ascertain whether it met a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article of the convention see perinçek cited above and peruzzi v italy no june the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not however to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article of the convention the decisions they have delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation see fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i in particular the court must determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify the interference are relevant and sufficient and whether the interference was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued see chauvy and others v france no echr vi and in so doing the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities basing their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article of the convention see perinçek cited above peruzzi cited above and the references therein the court reiterates that in assessing the proportionality of the interference the nature and severity of the sanctions imposed are also factors to be taken into account as the court has previously pointed out interference with freedom of expression may have a chilling effect on the exercise of that freedom the relatively moderate nature of a criminal fine see mor v france no december does not suffice to negate the risk of a chilling effect on the exercise of freedom of expression generally speaking while it is legitimate for the institutions of the state as guarantors of the institutional public order to be protected by the competent authorities the dominant position occupied by those institutions requires the authorities to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings see morice cited above with further referencesβ criteria relevant for the balancing exercise between the applicants right to freedom of expression and the necessity to maintain the authority of the judiciary the court has previously identified a number of criteria which are relevant when balancing the right to freedom of expression against the necessity to maintain the authority of the judiciary see for instance benitez moriana and iñigo fernandez v spain nos and and march and which are to be applied by the domestic courts see goryaynova v ukraine no october the court considers the following criteria relevant to the examination of the particular circumstances of the present case i contribution to a debate on a matter of public interest ii nature of the impugned publication and reasoning of the domestic courts iii nature and severity of the penalty imposed accordingly the court will now proceed to analyse the abovementioned criteria in the light of reasoning provided by the domestic courts in their decisions contribution to a debate on a matter of public interest the court first observes that the article in question including the statements in paragraphs and discussed alleged practices of bribery at the domestic courts a topic which was clearly of legitimate interest to the general public but at the same time if treated in a defamatory manner was capable of undermining the authority of the judiciary the court reiterates that questions concerning the functioning of the judiciary fall within the public interest so a high level of protection of freedom of expression with the authorities thus having a particularly narrow margin of appreciation will normally be accorded on the other hand judges must be protected from destructive attacks and the authority of the judiciary should be maintained see paragraphs and above the court notes that in the present case the domestic courts did not examine at all whether the publication concerned an issue of public interest concentrating solely on the veracity of the impugned statements and the harm to the judges reputation in this respect the court observes that paragraphs and specifically mentioned two courts the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal where all of the claimants worked as judges the court agrees that the statements used by the authors in paragraphs and suggested the existence of illegal practices in the aforementioned courts which could constitute criminal offences given the seriousness of the allegation those statements were capable of undermining the authority of the judiciary however by omitting to analyse the importance of the issue of public interest in the dispute the domestic courts failed to take into consideration the essential function that the press fulfils in a democratic society see among many other authorities lindon otchakovsky laurens and july cited above and engage in a balancing exercise regarding the need to maintain the authority of the judiciary such analysis was of particular importance given the subject matter of the publication alleged illegal judicial conduct and hence the authority of the judiciary nature of the impugned publication and reasoning of the domestic courts the court observes that the applicant a journalist was held civilly liable for an article published in a newspaper in particular the claimants stressed that the statements contained in paragraphs and of the article had undermined the authority of the judiciary thus in their decisions the domestic courts relied heavily on the finding that the impugned statements were not value judgments but consisted of factual information while mindful of the need to make a careful distinction between statements of facts and value judgments see cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no echr xi the court considers that the thrust of the present case is not the distinction between statements of facts and value judgments as such but the fact that the applicant was found liable for having reported the opinion of a third party namely ch see novaya gazeta and milashina v russia no october the court takes note that paragraph of the article began with the phrase by the way ch conducted an investigation and came to the conclusion that it continued with the phrases in a letter to the ch set out and as proof ch cited framing the very statements that constituted the subject matter of the defamation proceedings the court therefore concludes that the above paragraph consisted of the applicants reporting on chs actions and opinions as to paragraph of the article the court attaches importance to the fact that it was published as was indeed established by the domestic courts see paragraph above in the form of an interview given that the paragraph in issue started with a direct quote of ch the reason for my address to the verkhovna rada said ch was case no and taking note of the wording that follows the author simply reproduced the statements made by ch indeed at the court hearing ch confirmed that the statements were based on information provided by him see paragraph above the court reiterates that the punishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person in an interview would seriously hamper a contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so see jersild v denmark september series a no the court further notes that news reporting based on interviews or reproducing the statements of others whether edited or not constitutes one of the most important means whereby the press is able to play its vital role of public watchdog see for instance observer and guardian cited above in such cases a distinction needs to be made according to whether the statements emanate from the journalist or are quotations from others see thorgeir thorgeirson cited above jersild cited above and pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi taking note of the above caselaw the court observes that in the present case the domestic courts failed to distinguish between the statements made by ch and the reporting of such statements by the applicant by not having elaborated on whether the applicant could be held responsible under the relevant law for relaying that persons statements while making it clear who the author was see paragraph above as a result the applicant was held liable for the statements that did not emanate from him but were clearly identified as proffered by another person see gazeta ukraina tsentr cited above the court further notes that the concept of responsible journalism requires that journalists check the accuracy and reliability of information provided to the public to a reasonable extent as well as comply with the law while carrying out their professional activities see paragraph above the court points out that it was not alleged that the applicant had obtained the information in question by unlawful means the domestic courts concluded that the applicant had failed to verify the information contained in the impugned statements before its publication and had thus failed to comply with his journalistic duties see paragraph above however in both his written submissions and at the hearings before the domestic courts the applicant submitted that before publication of the article he had checked that the letter containing the statements and opinions expressed by ch had indeed been sent by the latter to the competent state authorities see paragraphs above in addition chs allegations were corroborated with the case file materials of several cases examined by the courts mentioned in the article and the applicant had discovered this in the context of his own journalistic investigation publishing a series of analytical articles on the subject see paragraphs above the applicant submitted copies of these materials to the courts examining the defamation claim nonetheless the domestic courts failed to provide adequate reasoning while dismissing in a very formalistic manner the applicants arguments in this regard see paragraphs above the domestic courts referred to the fact that upon examination of chs allegations by the state security service no proof of the existence of criminal activities in the courts in question had been found see paragraph above however they did not provide any important details as to the scope of such examination did not rely on any documents and importantly did not clarify the relevance of the examination of chs allegations by the state security service which postdated the impugned publication to the applicants liability for defamation for having reported chs statements the court notes that in view of the applicants submissions before the domestic courts it could be concluded that since in paragraphs and of the impugned publication he had reported on the chs allegations brought before the domestic authorities the applicant had duly verified the fact that ch had indeed made such allegations the court finds that the domestic courts did not provide relevant and sufficient reasoning demonstrating that the applicant had not acted with the due diligence expected of a responsible journalist reporting on a matter of public interest see erla hlynsdόttir v iceland no july and björk eiðsdóttir v iceland no july or specified any actions that had been expected from the applicant as a journalist in such circumstances nature and severity of the penalty imposed the court observes that the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are further factors to be considered when assessing the proportionality of an interference furthermore the court must be satisfied that the penalty does not amount to a form of censorship intended to discourage the press from expressing criticism in the context of a debate on a topic of public interest such a sanction is likely to deter journalists from contributing to public discussion of issues affecting the life of the community by the same token it is liable to hamper the press in performing its task as purveyor of information and public watchdog see bédat cited above the court observes that in the present case the applicant was ordered to pay eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage while this amount undoubtedly was not unusually high it was not symbolic or insignificant in ukraine at the relevant time furthermore the domestic courts ordered the removal of the article from the website and the publication of a retraction the court reiterates that where fines are concerned the relatively moderate nature of this type of sanction would not suffice to negate the risk of a chilling effect on the exercise of the right to freedom of expression see morice cited above in these circumstances the fact that the proceedings were civil rather than criminal in nature and that the amount of compensation which the applicant was ordered to pay was relatively moderate does not diminish the importance of the failure by the domestic courts to base their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts and to adduce relevant and sufficient reasons that brings the court to the conclusion that the interference complained of was not necessary in a democratic society see for a similar finding godlevskiy v russia no october conclusion the afore mentioned leads the court to conclude that the reasons that the domestic courts adduced to justify the interference with the applicants rights were not relevant and sufficient in particular due to their failure to address key elements of the case the court further finds that the domestic courts can not be said to have applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article or to have based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see cumhuriyet vakfı and others cited above and ringier axel springer slovakia as v slovakia no no january the court is therefore not satisfied that the domestic courts performed a balancing exercise between the conflicting interests in the light of the abovementioned factors it follows that the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression was not necessary in a democratic society accordingly there has been a violation of article of the convention on account of the domestic courts decisions in the defamation proceedings other alleged violations of the convention the applicant also complained under article and article of the convention and article of protocol no to the convention of the unfairness of the court proceedings of a violation of his intellectual property rights and of professional discrimination the court has examined the remainder of the applicants complaints and considers that in the light of all the materials in its possession and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the convention or its protocols it follows that this part of the application must be rejected as being manifestly illfounded pursuant to article and of the convention application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court finds that there has been a violation of the convention or the protocols thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party damage the applicant claimed euros eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage he stated that considerable harm had been done to his journalistic reputation as a result of the decisions of the domestic courts and he had been ostracised and discredited in professional circles and that the newspaper had terminated its working relationship with him and he had been unable to get offers from other employers he stated that he had been in a state of depression and psychological stress he relied on the income he would have received from the newspaper had they not terminated his contract between and the government contested those claims considering them unsubstantiated and exorbitant they noted that the applicant had failed to demonstrate a direct causal link between the termination of his employment and the domestic proceedings in question or with the loss of future income referring to the courts decision in ilhan v turkey gc no echr vii they considered that the applicants claims were of a largely speculative nature they also considered the rest of his claims in this respect unsubstantiated the court ruling on an equitable basis awards the applicant eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage plus any tax that may be chargeable costs and expenses the applicant also claimed ukrainian hryvnias the equivalent of eur at the material time in respect of his expenses for legal assistance translation and postage the government contested those claims noting that the applicant had failed to provide any documents in respect of legal assistance he had allegedly received such as a power of attorney or a contract for legal assistance as to translation expenses the government noted that the receipts provided by the applicant did not prove that the respective amounts had been paid for translation services in the context of the proceedings before the court lastly the government noted that the applicant had submitted supporting documents only in respect of part of the postal expenses claimed by him according to the courts caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these were actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum in the present case regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria the court considers it reasonable to award the sum of eur in respect of postal and translation expenses for the proceedings before the court plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant default interest the court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the european central bank to which should be added three percentage points for these reasons the court unanimouslydeclares the complaints under article of the convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention on account of the domestic courts decisions in the injunction proceedings holds that there has been a violation of article of the convention on account of the domestic courts decisions in the defamation proceedings holdsa that the respondent state is to pay the applicant within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with article of the convention the following amounts to be converted

eur one hundred and fortyseven euros plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant in respect of costs and expensesb that from the expiry of the abovementioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage points dismisses the

president rectified on november the text was administrative court rectified on november the text ch also confirmed that in those paragraphs the applicant had used information provided by him was

36,the applicant was born in and lives in istanbul at the time of the events giving rise to the present application he was the owner and editorinchief of a publishing house aram basım ve yayıncılık in august the applicants company published a book entitled patika gerilla anıları iv the path guerrilla memoirs iv hereinafter the book the editor of the book was a certain bk the page book consisted of the memoirs of seventeen members of the pkk the authors of the memoirs described their lives in the pkk camps in rural areas in both turkey and iraq armed clashes with the turkish security forces and their ideology and opinions regarding the situation in turkey in september the public prosecutor attached to the istanbul state security court launched an investigation into the book on september he asked that court to order the seizure of copies of the book on the grounds that certain passages on pages contained propaganda in favour of the pkk on the same day a single judge at the istanbul state security court made an interim order for the seizure of copies of the book the judge considered that the passages referred to by the public prosecutor incited the use of methods of violence and terror and thus constituted propaganda in favour of the pkk on october an application by the applicant to set aside the order of september was rejected on october the istanbul public prosecutor filed an indictment with the istanbul state security court charging the applicant with disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation under section of the prevention of terrorism act law no the public prosecutor cited a number of passages from pages and claimed that in those passages members of the pkk were depicted as heroes and their acts and activities were praised on march the istanbul state security court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to one years imprisonment and a fine in its judgment the court referred to a number of passages on pages and and considered that those passages constituted propaganda in favour of the pkk on october the court of cassation quashed the firstinstance judgment holding that the firstinstance court should consider the provisions of the new press act law no which had entered into force on june it then remitted the case file to the istanbul assize court since in the meantime state security courts had been abolished on july the istanbul assize court held that it did not have jurisdiction over the case and sent the file to the beyoğlu criminal court on july the beyoğlu criminal court also ruled that it lacked jurisdiction on october the court of cassation decided that the istanbul assize court had jurisdiction over the case and sent the case file to that court on june the istanbul assize court once again convicted the applicant as charged the court sentenced him to ten months imprisonment and a fine of turkish liras try in its judgment the court held on the basis of the examination of the book in its entirety it has been observed that the book depicts the activities of members of the pkkkadek the terrorist organisation and their socalled impressions of the clashes between them and members of the security forces the book consists of different chapters written by different people the preface to the book contains the following our president apo states that the outcome of the war is very valuable while the history written and life created by bullets drip off pens guerrillas go beyond the faraway corners of our land with their bags on the backs and their weapons in their hands we smile with a picture of war and with a song we add new people to those who have left us on page it is stated we had to change the anatolian peoples army for emancipation in accordance with the needs of the anatolian people they did not know us as members of the pkk and we were not established there if we went there as the pkk we could not win their hearts therefore when we first arrived in the black sea region we used the name anatolian peoples army for emancipation some people told us that they had never heard of our organisation and they thought that we were a very good one some had difficulties as they suspected us to be the pkk we could not explicitly say that we were pkk members our president abdullah öcalan stated that he knew the people of the black sea and advised us to raise consciousness through our attitudes and actions first and then to tell them that we were pkk members after they trusted us on pages and it is stated i shared my joy with them by saying friends four vehicles belonging to the enemy were destroyed they were burned that day i forgot about my sleeplessness i did not think about my tiredness hunger or thirst as much as i had done before i had only one wish engaging in a clash and getting in a good shot with my weapon which i had not used although i had had it with me for long time he asked my friend is this your first armed clash i said yes armed clashes are nice arent they yes they are the istanbul assize court considered that the abovementioned passages and certain other passages on pages and praised the armed clashes between pkk militants and the security forces and those militants acts as a result the court found that the book did not have any literary value according to the assize court the publisher had not aimed to publish a book of memoirs but had had the intention of disseminating propaganda inciting the terrorist organisation and its militants to violence or other methods of terrorism on february the court of cassation quashed the judgment the court of cassation quashed the judgment of june on the ground that a prepayment notice had not been served on the applicant in accordance with section of law no and article of the criminal code on april the istanbul assize court decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the applicant since the prosecution was timebarred ii relevant domestic law between august and july section of law no read as follows any person who assists members of the abovementioned organisations terrorist organisations or who disseminates propaganda inciting others to violence or other methods of terrorism shall be liable to serve a term of imprisonment of one to five years and receive a judicial fine of five million liras to one billion liras the first sentence of section of law no was amended as follows by law no which entered into force on july any person who disseminates propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation shall be liable to serve a term of imprisonment of one to five years the first sentence of section of law no amended on april by law no currently reads as follows any person who disseminates propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation by justifying praising or encouraging the use of methods constituting coercion violence or threats shall be liable to serve a term of imprisonment of one to five years the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that the criminal proceedings brought against him pursuant to section of law no and his conviction under that section had constituted a violation of his right to freedom of expression he further complained under the same article about the seizure of copies of the book on september article of the convention reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that claim a admissibility seizure of copies of the book on september the court observes that on september an interim order for the seizure of copies of the book was made and that on october the applicants application to set aside the order of september was rejected the present application on the other hand was lodged on september accordingly this part of the application has been lodged out of time and must be rejected in accordance with article and of the convention criminal proceedings brought against the applicant the government claimed that the applicant did not have victim status within the meaning of article of the convention as he had not been convicted at the end of the proceedings the court considers that the governments objection regarding the applicants lack of victim status is closely linked to the merits of his complaints under this head it therefore joins this issue to the merits the court further notes that this part of the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions the government submitted that the applicant could not claim to be a victim as the proceedings against him had become timebarred they therefore argued that there had been no interference with the applicants freedom of expression alternatively they submitted that the applicant had been prosecuted pursuant to section of law no and thus the interference if any had been prescribed by law they further submitted that the domestic authorities had pursued the legitimate aims of protecting public order and national security the government lastly submitted that the interference had been necessary in a democratic society given that the content of the book in question had promoted hatred hostility the use of arms militancy and revenge the applicant submitted that his trial which had lasted for more than seven years and which had resulted in his being convicted under section of law no had amounted to an interference with his right guaranteed under article of the convention he also claimed that the interference in question had not been necessary in a democratic society in that respect he submitted that the book in question was like an historical novel and that read in its entirety it did not incite violence the courts assessmenta whether there was an interference the court notes at the outset that it has already examined and rejected a similar objection by the government to the admissibility in the case of dilipak v turkey no september the circumstances of which were similar to the present case the court finds no reason which would require it to reach a different conclusion in the present case in particular criminal charges were pending against the applicant for a considerable length of time and he could not be sure that he would not face further legal consequences if he as a publisher published other books on similar matters either during those criminal proceedings or at any future stage the court considers that the seven and a half years of criminal proceedings conducted against the applicant in view of the chilling effect which those proceedings may well have caused can not be viewed as solely comprising purely hypothetical risks to the applicant and considers that they constituted genuine and effective restrictions per se the declaration that the proceedings had become timebarred merely put an end to the abovementioned risks but did not alter the fact that those risks had put the applicant under pressure for a substantial period of time ibid and see also semir güzel v turkey no september accordingly the court rejects the governments objection and finds that the criminal proceedings in question constituted an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression as secured by article of the conventionb whether the interference was justified the court notes that it is not disputed between the parties that the interference was prescribed by law the dispute in the present case concerns the questions whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim and whether it was necessary in a democratic society agit demir v turkey no february the court is prepared to accept that in the instant case the national authorities may be considered to have pursued the legitimate aims of protecting national security and preventing disorder and crime see faruk temel v turkey no february as regards the necessity of the interference in a democratic society the court reiterates the basic principles laid down in its judgments concerning article see for example sürek v turkey no gc no echr iv şener v turkey no july and bédat v switzerland gc no echr the court considers that the principles contained in the abovementioned judgments pertaining to the media also apply to the publication of books in general or written texts other than the periodical press see association ekin v france no echr viii and çamyar and berktaş v turkey no february it will examine the present case in the light of the above principles the court observes that the book consists of seventeen chapters written by seventeen members of the pkk who had been involved in that organisations armed activities in the chapters the authors convey the details of their daily lives in camps and rural areas in different regions of turkey and iraq their experiences with local people their interactions with other members of the pkk as well as their political opinions and emotions in the courts view given that serious disturbances have occurred between the security forces and members of the pkk since approximately involving a very heavy loss of life and the imposition of emergency rule in much of the southeast of turkey for many years it may be concluded that the book may be considered to contain issues of public concern hence in the courts view publication of a book describing the lives of pkk members per se does not run counter to the values of a democratic society in that connection the court observes that the applicant was not charged with disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk because he had published the book in question but because the judicial authorities considered that certain passages in the book constituted propaganda in favour of that organisation as a matter of fact a number of passages contained in the book were cited in both the bill of indictment and the firstinstance courts judgments of march and june and the applicant was prosecuted on the basis of the content of those passages the court must have particular regard to the impugned passages and the context in which they were published with regard to the context it will also take into account the background to the case submitted to it described in paragraph above see among many others sürek no cited above başkaya and okçuoğlu v turkey gc nos and echr iv cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no echr xi and demirel and ateş v turkey no no december the court notes that the common factor in most of the passages cited and referred to by the public prosecutor the istanbul state security court and the istanbul assize court is the authors reference in those passages to either abdullah öcalan the leader of the pkk being the president or the members of the security forces being enemies in the courts view those passages can not be construed as encouraging violence armed resistance or an uprising however the court observes that three passages in the book namely the preface and the passages on pages and cited in the judgment of june see paragraph above clearly glorify the use of armed force and praise deadly violence in particular in the preface the results of the war are presented as valuable and the deaths of members of the pkk are romanticised on page the destruction of the security forces vehicles was announced as very good news and the author expresses his desire to get in a good shot lastly on page an armed clash between the pkk and the security forces was described as an enjoyable event hence the court finds that the domestic authorities assessment that the passages in question constituted incitement to violence and to other methods of terrorism was reasonable indeed the message which was communicated to the reader in those parts is that recourse to violence is necessary satisfactory and even pleasant see mutatis mutandis sürek no cited above the court notes that the passages on pages and were not written by the applicant the author of the preface on the other hand is not known as there is no signature however given that the book was edited by bk it is possible to assume that the preface was written by him while it is true that there is nothing in the case file showing that the applicant personally associated himself with the views contained in the preface and on pages and he nevertheless provided the writers with an outlet for stirring up violence see sürek v turkey no gc no july he was the owner and editorinchief and as such had the power to shape the editorial direction of the book for that reason he was vicariously subject to the duties and responsibilities which authors take on when they disseminate their writings to the public and which assume an even greater importance in situations of conflict and tension see sürek no cited above sürek no cited above halis doğan v turkey no no october and saygılı and falakaoğlu v turkey no no february lastly the court notes that although not decisive the criminal proceedings against the applicant were terminated as timebarred and that there was no final conviction nor was he detained on remand or made to serve any prison sentence in the context of the proceedings in question against this background the court finds that the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant as the owner and editorinchief of aram basım ve yayıncılık for publishing the book could reasonably be regarded as answering a pressing social need being proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued and thus being necessary in a democratic society there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the length of the proceedings was incompatible with the reasonable time requirement laid down in article of the convention which in so far as relevant provides in the determination of any criminal charge against him everyone is entitled to a hearing within a reasonable time by a tribunal the government contested that claim a admissibility the court observes at the outset that a new domestic remedy has been established in turkey since the application of the pilot judgment procedure in the case of ümmühan kaplan v turkey no march the court observes that it declared a new application inadmissible in its decision in the case of turgut and others v turkey no march on the grounds that the applicants had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies that is to say the new remedy established under law no in doing so the court considered in particular that this new remedy was a priori accessible and capable of offering a reasonable prospect of redress for complaints concerning the length of proceedings the court further points out that in its judgment in the case of ümmühan kaplan cited above it stressed that it could nevertheless pursue the examination of such applications under the normal procedure in cases which had already been communicated to the government prior to the entry into force of the new remedy it further notes that in the present case the government did not raise an objection in respect of the new domestic remedy in view of the above the court decides to pursue the examination of the present complaint see rifat demir v turkey no june the court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the government submitted that that the length of the proceedings could not be considered unreasonable the applicant reiterated that the criminal proceedings against him had not been concluded within a reasonable time the court observes that the period to be taken into consideration began on september at the latest with the istanbul state security court granting the public prosecutors request for the seizure of copies of the book and ended on april when the istanbul assize court decided to discontinue the proceedings against the applicant it thus lasted for more than seven years and six months over two levels of jurisdiction the court notes that the case was not particularly complex furthermore no delays can be imputed to the applicant as to the conduct of the authorities the court observes that it took both the istanbul assize court and the beyoğlu criminal

several mass media outlets including radio liberty on the same day on february the minister for foreign affairs of armenia adopted decrees dismissing the first second and third applicants from office the fourth applicant was dismissed from office by a similar decree on march as a ground for the dismissals the decrees referred to sections subsection point j and subsection point c of the diplomatic service act հհ օրենքը դիվանագիտական ծառայության մասին containing description which stated inter alia that a diplomat had no right to use his official capacity and work facilities for the benefit of parties and nongovernmental organisations or in order to carry out other political or religious activity see paragraphs below on an unspecified date in march the applicants instituted administrative proceedings challenging their dismissal and seeking to be reinstated in their work in particular they claimed that the decrees on their dismissal contained no reasons regarding the particular instance where they had made use of their official capacity and work facilities for the benefit of parties or nongovernmental organisations or for engaging in political or religious activities as prohibited by the sections of the diplomatic service act they also claimed that dismissal on the ground of convictions and opinions was prohibited by law on april the ministry of foreign affairs as a respondent lodged a response with the administrative court հհ վարչական դատարան claiming that the applicants by making their statement of february which had then been reported by the mass media and announced during the demonstration had engaged in political activities furthermore the applicants had made use of their official capacity since they indicated their official titles in the statement on may the administrative court dismissed the applicants claim finding that their dismissal from work was lawful since the applicants by making the impugned statement in essence had engaged in political activity in this respect the administrative court mentioned that the impugned statement concerned political processes as it contained a political assessment of election and postelection events furthermore that statement as well as that of the ambassadors had been read aloud during the demonstration organised by a political force and had received a political assessment the administrative court also found that the applicants by indicating their post titles had made use of their official capacity the applicants right to freedom of expression as protected by article of the constitution հհ սահմանադրություն was not breached since the applicants in exercising that right had made use of their official status and work facilities therefore the restriction on that right was in compliance with article of the constitution besides the applicants had not been dismissed on the ground of their political opinion but because in disseminating that opinion they had made use of their official status which was prohibited by law on an unspecified date the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of the administrative court claiming inter alia a violation of their right to freedom of expression as protected by article of the convention besides they claimed that they had been discriminated against on grounds of political opinion in violation of article since those diplomats or state officials who had expressed publicly their support for the progovernmental candidate had never faced any sanctions the true reason for their dismissal was their critical opinion of government actions in the sphere of human rights and democratisation they also claimed that their dismissal had been based on an erroneous interpretation of sections subsection point j and subsection point c of the diplomatic service act since they had not made use of their official capacity or work facilities when making the impugned statement furthermore the statement had not been made for the benefit of any political party and it could not be qualified as political activity as such on september the court of cassation հհ վճռաբեկ դատարան decided to declare the applicants appeal on points of

official capacity and work facilities or the information obtained when performing his official duties for personal benefit or the benefit of third persons as well as for the benefit of parties and nongovernmental organisations including religious ones or in order to carry out other political or religious activity iii relevant international materials according to the resolution of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on the functioning of democratic institutions in armenia the presidential elections involved a political crisis in armenia the resolution states inter alia that the parliamentary assembly regrets that the violations and shortcomings observed did nothing to restore the currently lacking public confidence in the electoral process and raised questions among a part of the armenian public with regard to the credibility of the outcome of the election this lack of public confidence was the basis for the peaceful protests held without prior official notification that ensued after the announcement of the preliminary results and which were tolerated by the authorities for ten days the assembly deplores the clashes between the police and the protesters and the escalation of violence on march which resulted in deaths and about people being injured the exact circumstances that led to the tragic events of march as well as the manner in which they were handled by the authorities including the imposition of a state of emergency in yerevan from to march and the alleged excessive use of force by the police are issues of considerable controversy and should be the subject of a credible independent investigation the assembly condemns the arrest and continuing detention of scores of persons including more than opposition supporters and three members of parliament some of them on seemingly artificial and politically motivated charges this constitutes a de facto crackdown on the opposition by the authorities while the outbreak of public resentment culminating in the tragic events of march may have been unexpected the assembly believes that the underlying causes of the crisis are deeply rooted in the failure of the key institutions of the state to perform their functions in full compliance with democratic standards and the principles of the rule of law and the protection of human rights the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicants complained that their dismissal from office following their statements in the media had violated their right to freedom of expression under article of the convention article of the convention reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissionsa the applicants as regards the lawfulness of the interference with their freedom of expression the applicants agreed that the diplomatic service act had met the requirement of accessibility but argued that it had lacked sufficient precision and foreseeability section subsection point c of the act referred to other political activity which was vague as a term and the adjective political had been given an extremely broad scope involving practically any activity in the applicants social and professional environment the way the provision was phrased at the material time all elements mentioned in it had to exist in order for it to become applicable it could not therefore have been applied in the present case in which all required elements did not exist it was only after the amendment of the act in that the existence of a single element made the provision applicable moreover the provision had lacked foreseeability as it had not been applied to anyone before the applicants and it was therefore not known how it would be interpreted the interference with the applicants freedom of expression had thus not been prescribed by law as section subsection point c of the diplomatic service act had lacked precision and foreseeability on the other hand the applicants agreed that the interference had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting national security and public safety as well as preventing disorder as to the necessity in a democratic society the applicants maintained that their statement had been of strictly neutral political content and that it had aimed to achieve values enshrined in the constitution and in the international treaties binding on armenia it had not been intended to support any political party the applicants had drafted the statement as citizens of armenia and not in their official capacity the fact that the first applicant had received the statement of several ambassadors in his electronic mail could not be held against him as he had only been a passive receiver the interference had not been proportionate as section subsection point c of the diplomatic service act had been applied to the applicants selectively and without all required statutory elements being present the applicants argued that the reasons relied on by the government had not been relevant to justify the interference with the applicants freedom of expression and to show that it had been necessary in a democratic society it had been disproportionate to the aims pursuedb the government the government maintained that the applicants dismissal from their posts following their statement of february was compatible with article of the convention their dismissal was prescribed by law as it had been based in particular on section subsection point j of the diplomatic service act which provided that a diplomat should be dismissed from office if he violated any of the restrictions prescribed in section of the act one of those restrictions was that a diplomat had no right to use his official capacity and work facilities for the benefit of political parties or nongovernmental organisations or in order to carry out other political or religious activity contrary to what the applicants claimed at the relevant time the existence of a single element made the provision applicable this act was both accessible and foreseeable and the notions used in it were sufficiently clear the act had been designed to cover relations within the diplomatic service and it was thus designed for professionals the applicants had had from to years professional experience as members of diplomatic corps had they been uncertain about the content of the act they could have sought advice from the ministry of foreign affairs taking into consideration the applicants positions and professional experience they had to be aware of the legal framework regulating their service including the restrictions they had also been well aware of the political situation in armenia the character of their public statement and its possible impact the applicants could and must have foreseen the consequences of their statement especially as the ambassadors who had issued the original statement had been dismissed from their posts the day before and their dismissal had been widely reported in the media the government argued that the applicants dismissal pursued a legitimate aim namely the aim of guaranteeing the neutrality of civil servants including diplomatic corps the restriction provided in section subsection point c of the diplomatic service act had the legitimate aim of establishing a professional diplomatic service which would not be politically loaded would not endure impact from any political force and would not depend on internal political developments and changes in political conjuncture the aim was thus to uphold democracy and to protect national security in a newly independent country as to the necessity in a democratic society the government maintained that the interference had been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and that the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it had been relevant and sufficient the applicants statement had had political content and it could have had a negative effect on armenias international reputation in their statement the applicants had assessed a political process supported a political line of a political force and put in question the presidential elections of they had carried out this political activity using their names and positions in particular any public statement made by the first applicant who was the press secretary to the foreign minister could potentially be perceived as the official position of the ministry diplomats were completely free in their political opinions as long as these were not pronounced publicly moreover the statement had also been discussed in the media and this had impaired the political neutrality and reputation of the diplomatic staff of the ministry of foreign affairs the interference was thus necessary in a democratic society the courts assessmenta whether there was an interference the court notes that even though neither of the parties took a specific stand on the issue of whether there had been an interference within the meaning of article of the convention the court finds it that the applicants dismissal from their posts as a result of their statement issued on february clearly constituted an interference with their right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the conventionb whether it was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim the court notes that according to the government the impugned measures had a basis in armenian law in particular in sections subsection point j and of the diplomatic service act which provisions were both accessible and foreseeable and the notions used in them were sufficiently clear moreover the interference complained of pursued a legitimate aim namely the aim of guaranteeing the neutrality of civil servants including diplomatic corps the applicants agreed that the diplomatic service act had been accessible but argued that it had lacked sufficient precision and foreseeability however they agreed that the interference had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting national security and public safety as well as preventing disorder the court reiterates that freedom of expression is subject to the exceptions set out in article of the convention the court accepts that in the present case the interference was based on sections subsection point j and of the diplomatic service act as in force at the relevant time and that these provisions were accessible the parties views however diverge as far as the precision and foreseeability of the said provisions are concerned the court must thus examine whether the provisions in question fulfil the precision and foreseeability requirements a norm can not be regarded as a law unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the individual to regulate his conduct he must be able if need be with appropriate advice to foresee to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances the consequences which a given action may entail those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty experience shows this to be unattainable again whilst certainty is highly desirable it may entail excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances accordingly many laws are inevitably couched in terms which to a greater or lesser extent are vague and whose interpretation and application are a question of practice see sunday times v the united kingdom no april series a no and mutatis mutandis kokkinakis v greece may series a no a as concerns the provisions in question at the relevant time the court finds no ambiguity in the contents of section subsection point j of the diplomatic service act it clearly provides that a diplomat shall be dismissed from office if he violates the restrictions enumerated in section of the act as regards section subsection point c of the act the court notes that the administrative court seems to have qualified the applicants act both as falling into the category of other political activity and as falling under the use of official capacity and work facilities for the benefit of parties and nongovernmental organisations the court finds that the latter category is sufficiently clearly worded for the purposes of article of the convention as to other political activity it is true that this formulation is more vague however it is apparent that the purpose of this general clause is to capture all other possible situations to which the provision may apply and which have not been specifically enumerated in the provision the court observes that the precision of the term other political activity is also connected to its foreseeability however even if it were true that at the relevant time in february there was no caselaw concerning the interpretation of section subsection point c of the diplomatic service act the court finds that the possibility that a diplomat could be dismissed on the basis of other political activity can not be regarded as unforeseeable the act was enacted to cover professional conduct of diplomats who formed a specific and restricted group at the time of the impugned events the act had been in force for several years the court agrees with the government that the applicants who were all professional diplomats and who had worked in this field for more than years could not therefore claim to be ignorant of the content of the said provision had they had doubts about the exact scope of the provision in question they should either have sought advice about its content or refrained from issuing their statement moreover it appears that those ambassadors who had issued the original statement only a day before were consequently dismissed from their posts on the basis of the same provision although the fact that they had been dismissed may not have been known to the applicants at the relevant time they must have held it possible that such interpretation of the provision in question could be foreseeable it must therefore be concluded that section subsection point c of the diplomatic service act was sufficiently clearly formulated in order to fulfil the requirements of precision and foreseeability under article of the convention moreover the applicants also claimed that the application of section subsection point c of the diplomatic service act to their cases had been erroneous as all elements required for its application did not exist the court reiterates that it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly made by a national court unless and insofar as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the convention see mutatis mutandis garcía ruiz v spain gc no echr i in the present case there is no indication that the domestic courts in their interpretation and application of the relevant law went beyond the margin allowed to them under the convention the court therefore concludes that the impugned interference was prescribed by law in addition it has not been disputed that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting national security and public safety as well as preventing disorder within the meaning of article see paragraphs and abovec whether the interference was necessary in a democratic societyi general principles the court reiterates that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of that pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society freedom of expression as enshrined in article is subject to a number of exceptions which however must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established see for example handyside v the united kingdom december series a no lingens v austria july series a no and jersild v denmark september series a no the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with a european supervision embracing both the law and the decisions applying it even those given by independent courts the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient see the sunday times v the united kingdom no november series a no in so doing the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see jersild v denmark cited above while the court has admitted that it is legitimate for a state to impose on civil servants on account of their status a duty of discretion civil servants are individuals and as such qualify for the protection of article of the convention see vogt v germany september series a no and baka v hungary gc no echr it therefore falls to the court having regard to the circumstances of each case to determine whether a fair balance has been struck between an individuals fundamental right to freedom of expression and the legitimate interest of a democratic state in ensuring that its civil service properly furthers the purposes enumerated in article of the convention in carrying out this review the court will bear in mind that whenever a civil servants right to freedom of expression is in issue the duties and responsibilities referred to in article of the convention assume a special significance which justifies leaving to the national authorities a certain margin of appreciation in determining whether the impugned interference is proportionate to the above aim see vogt cited above albayrak v turkey no january and baka cited above in this regard the court considers that measures directed at the need to preserve the political neutrality of a precise category of civil servants can in principle be considered legitimate and proportional for the purposes of article of the convention see ahmed and others v the united kingdom september reports of judgments and decisions vi however such a measure should not be applied in a general manner which could affect the essence of the right protected without having in mind the functions and the role of the civil servant in question and in particular the circumstances of each case see mutatis mutandis küçükbalaban and kutlu v turkey nos and march and dedecan and ok v turkey nos and september furthermore the court has recognised bearing in mind the role of diplomats in society that it is a legitimate aim in any democratic society to have a politically neutral body of civil servants including the diplomatic corps in view of the particular history of some contracting states the national authorities of these states may so as to ensure the consolidation and maintenance of democracy consider it necessary to have constitutional safeguards to achieve this aim by restricting the freedom of civil servants to engage in political activities see mutatis mutandis rekvényi v hungary gc cited above a democratic state is thus entitled to require civil servants to be loyal to the constitutional principles on which it is founded see vogt v germany cited above the court has found that the special bond of trust and loyalty between a civil servant and the state as employer is important in particular in cases of diplomats who are especially expected to be loyal to the state this is a particularly important element in societies which are in the process of building up the institutions of a pluralistic democracy see mutatis mutandis rekvényi v hungary gc cited above ii application of the above principles to the present case turning to the facts of the present case the court considers that in the light of the above principles it must in its examination take account of the circumstances and the overall background against which the applicants statements were made it must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case as a whole attaching particular importance to the office held by the applicants the form and content of their statements and in particular the context in which they were made see baka cited above the courts task is to determine whether the applicants dismissal corresponded to a pressing social need and whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued according to the government the applicants had in their statement assessed a political process supported a political line of a political force and put in question the presidential elections of using their names and positions in the governments view diplomats were completely free in their political opinions as long as these were not pronounced publicly see paragraph above the applicants disagreed with the government maintaining that their statement had been of strictly neutral political content and that it had aimed to achieve values enshrined in the constitution and in the international treaties binding on armenia it had not been made in support of any political party the applicants argued that the reasons relied on by the government had not been relevant to justify the interference with their freedom of expression and to show that it had been necessary in a democratic society see paragraph above the court notes that in the present case the only act which was regarded as political by the domestic courts and authorities and which led to the applicants dismissal from their posts was the fact that they had published the impugned statement on february as a consequence the minister for foreign affairs of armenia adopted on the next day on february decrees dismissing the first second and third applicants from office the fourth applicant was dismissed from office by a similar decree on march see paragraph above at the outset the court considers it of particular importance in its assessment that all of the four applicants occupied highranking positions within the ministry of foreign affairs and that their names with an explicit reference to their official titles appeared on the impugned statement see paragraphs and above in the light of its caselaw see paragraphs above the court thus considers that the respondent state in its assessment on whether to institute disciplinary proceedings and proceed with dismissals was entitled to have regard to the requirement that highranking civil servants such as the applicants respected and ensured the special bond of trust and loyalty between them and the state in the performance of their functions furthermore the court notes that in their published statement of february see paragraph above the applicants made a specific reference to the statement made on the previous day by several ambassadors for armenia see paragraph above explicitly stating that they joined that statement then in the applicants statement outrage was expressed against the fraud of the election process and a demand was put forward that urgent steps be undertaken to call into life the recommendations contained in international reports the court thus considers that it is not in a position to call into question the relevance of the administrative courts finding see paragraph above that the applicants impugned statement concerned political processes as it contained a political assessment of election and postelection events the court also notes that the applicants instituted proceedings for judicial review challenging their dismissal and seeking to be reinstated in their posts in its examination of the applicants claims the administrative court found that the applicants by indicating their official titles in the published statement had made use of their official capacity in consequence the domestic court found that their right to freedom of expression protected by article of the constitution had not been breached in view of the limitation clause as provided for by article of the constitution in the courts view this demonstrates that the domestic court took into account the applicants right to freedom of expression in its overall assessment of the applicants claims in a manner sufficiently in conformity with the requirements of the convention finally in its assessment the court attaches particular importance to the overall domestic context in which the applicants published their statements under their official titles that context seemingly involved a political crisis see inter alia resolution of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on the functioning of democratic institutions in armenia in paragraph above the court reiterates that as civil servants enjoy the freedom to express their opinions and ideas under article of the convention like all other individuals see baka cited above contracting states must allow a certain space in domestic public debate even in difficult times for the participation of civil servants in particular where their experience and expertise may be conducive to an informed debate on issues of public interest and importance however the position of the applicants in the present case differs from that of the applicant in the baka case contrary to the present applicants the baka case concerned a public servant who had a specific statutory duty as president of the national council of justice to express his opinion on legislative reforms affecting the judiciary see baka cited above the court recalls that as it has previously held in view of the particular history of a contracting state the national authorities may so as to ensure the consolidation and maintenance of democracy consider it necessary to have constitutional safeguards to achieve the aim in a democratic society of having a politically neutral body of civil servants including the diplomatic corps by restricting the freedom of civil servants to engage in political activities see paragraph above viewing the particular circumstances of the present case as a whole the court considers that no evidence has been adduced that could call into question the respondent states assessment in this matter as to the sanction the court considers that the dismissal of the applicants although severe did not constitute a disproportionate measure taking into account the particular circumstances of the case and the available options under domestic law against this background and taking account of all of the elements described above the court finds that the government have demonstrated that the measures taken against the applicants were based on relevant and sufficient grounds and were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued the court accordingly finds that there has been no violation of article of the convention ii remainder of the application the applicants also complained under article of the convention that the administrative court had lacked independence and impartiality since it had failed to apply the law and to evaluate the evidence correctly besides the applicants had been denied access to a court as the court of cassation had failed to give any reasons when declaring their appeal on points of law inadmissible for lack of merit the applicants further complained under article of the convention that they had been discriminated against on the ground of their political opinion having regard to the material before it the court finds that the facts complained of do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the applicants rights under the convention accordingly this part of the application is manifestly illfounded and must be rejected pursuant to article a and of the convention for these reasons the court declares unanimously the complaint concerning article of the convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible holds by six votes to one that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on november pursuant to rule and of the rules of court abel campos mirjana lazarova trajkovska registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgmenta concurring opinion of judges sicilianos and mahoneyb dissenting opinion of judge lazarova trajkovska mltacconcurring opinion of judges sicilianos and mahoneywe have voted with the majority in holding that no violation of article of the convention can be found on the basis of the material before the court we would however have preferred that for the sake of clarity the judgment contain more developed reasoning on the issue of the proportionality of the interference with the applicants exercise of their freedom of expression paragraph of the judgment reads as to the sanction the court considers that the dismissal of the applicants although severe did not constitute a disproportionate measure taking into account the particular circumstances of the case and the available options under the law this is a general affirmation the only specification of the grounds for the conclusion arrived at being the particular circumstances of the case and the available options under the law the latter mention is presumably a reference to section of the diplomatic service act which appears to prescribe dismissal from office as the sole sanction available for misconduct contrary to section of the act see paragraphs of the judgment it is difficult to understand how this feature of the law although relevant to the issue of lawfulness dealt with in paragraphs of the judgment constitutes a factor indicative of the proportional nature of an individual measure taken under the law indeed in some instances it may be the inflexibility of the applicable law in not allowing for graduated sanctions which is the source of disproportionality of the interference in the form of an excessively severe sanction in relation to the misconduct found by definition in every case the application of the test of proportionality whichever way it goes depends on the particular circumstances of the case that being so the first ground mentioned in paragraph of the judgment merely states the obvious and does not offer any substantive reasoning for the conclusion arrived at in our view the factors on which the authorities could rely in order to provide for and impose dismissal from office as a suitable sanction for the misconduct held against the applicants are indeed adverted to the judgment at paragraph where the court outlines in an introductory manner a number of factual considerations of importance for the application of the relevant convention principles to the present case thus the respondent state in its assessment on whether to institute disciplinary proceedings and proceed with dismissals was entitled to have regard to the requirement that highranking civil servants such as the applicants respected and ensured the special bond of trust and loyalty between them and the state in the performance of their functions in brief for us what makes it possible for dismissal from office to be regarded as a proportionate measure is the fact that in making use of their official capacity for political purposes in a publicly disseminated statement the applicants could be taken by the state as their employer to have destroyed the special bond of trust and loyalty that they as relatively senior diplomats in the ministry of foreign affairs owed to it we would therefore have preferred that some such explanation as to the proportionality of the interference with the applicants exercise of their freedom of expression be given and developed in paragraph rather than being presented in paragraph as a general introductory consideration on a second point we have noted the conclusion of the parliamentary assembly in relation to the violence that occurred in armenia in march in the wake of the disputed presidential election that was the subject of the applicants statement this conclusion in of the parliamentary assemblys resolution on the functioning of democratic institutions in armenia quoted at paragraph of the judgment reads while the outbreak of public resentment culminating in the tragic events of march may have been unexpected the assembly believes that the underlying causes of the crisis are deeply rooted in the failure of the key institutions of the state to perform their functions in full compliance with democratic standards and the principles of the rule of law and the protection of human rights as demonstrated by the sad example of the totalitarian regimes in power in some european states prior to and after the second world war in extreme instances not merely the active collaboration of civil servants in the commission of human rights abuses by the authorities but even their passivity in the face of such abuses may be condemnable in human rights terms the present applicants did not however claim that the facts of their case were an illustration of such an extreme instance they did not for example argue that although their political action on february might in a normally functioning democratic society as referred to in paragraph of article have been prima facie susceptible of justifying a disciplinary measure as severe as dismissal it was nonetheless called for in defence of democratic standards and the principles of the rule of law and the protection of human rights to use the words of the parliamentary assembly had the applicants adduced some such argument on the basis of sufficiently plausible material the courts scrutiny of compliance with the requirements of paragraph of article would undoubtedly have been more demanding as it is the applicants submissions in this connection were rather directed towards showing that their statement was neutral and not political as such see paragraph of the judgment it is on that basis that like our colleagues we have subscribed to the conclusion in paragraph of the judgment that no evidence has been adduced that could call into question the respondent states assessment as to the necessity to restrict the applicants freedom to engage in political activities dissenting opinion of judge lazarova trajkovskai regret that i am unable to agree to a finding of no violation of article in this case in my view this case should be referred to the grand chamber freedom of expression is one of the essential foundations of a democratic society see handyside v the united kingdom judgment of december series a no although it is legitimate for a state to impose on civil servants on account of their status an obligation of discretion civil servants are individuals and as such qualify for the protection of article of the convention see baka v hungary gc no echr the status of civil servant does not deprive a person of the protection afforded by article of the convention in such cases it falls to the court having regard to the circumstances of each case to determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the fundamental rights of the individual to freedom of expression and the legitimate interests of a democratic state in ensuring that its civil service properly furthers the purposes enumerated in article see vogt v germany september series a no i agree with the majority that the applicants dismissal from their posts as a result of their statement published on february clearly constituted an interference with their right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the convention i can also agree that this interference was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim where i disagree with the majority is in respect of the chambers reasoning regarding the necessity and the proportionality of the impugned interference in particular in my view the administrative court did not balance the applicants right to freedom of expression under article of the convention with the interests of the state it does not emerge from the reasoning of the administrative court what pressing social need in the present case existed to justify as proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued the protection of the states interests over the applicants right to freedom of expression moreover i disagree with the majority that the dismissal of the applicants as the most severe measure did not constitute a disproportionate measure given the particular circumstances of the case and the available options under domestic law in this connection i note that the court has usually considered dismissal from employment to be a very harsh measure particularly when other more lenient and more appropriate disciplinary sanctions could or should have been envisaged see for example in other contexts guja v moldova gc no echr fuentes bobo v spain no february and kudeshkina v russia no february armenian legislation provides for a variety of reprimands which can be applied to a diplomat should he or she breach diplomatic ethics starting with a warning followed by a reprimand a severe reprimand a reduction in salary and finally dismissal government decree on approving the rules of ethics of a diplomat decree no of may provided inter alia that a diplomat is obliged b not to use or abuse his professional official capacity and work facilities or the information obtained when performing his official duties for personal benefit or the benefit of third persons as well as for the benefit of parties and nongovernmental organisations including religious ones or in order to carry out other political or religious activityand thata breach of these rules shall entail disciplinary sanctions it appears from the background to this case that the domestic authorities did not consider the imposition of other sanctions but instead proceeded instantly as a result of applicants actions to their dismissal from office the effects of the applicants dismissal were severe they were deprived of the opportunity to exercise the profession for which they had a calling for which they had been trained and in which they had acquired skills and experience see vogt v germany cited above the fact that there were no real effective safeguards available to the applicants added to the severity of the sanction it seems that there was no possibility for the applicants to appeal before the administrative organs it will be recalled in this respect that the fairness of the proceedings and the procedural guarantees afforded are also factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see for example kudeshkina v russia and baka v hungary both cited above in light of all the foregoing the reasons put forward by the government in order to justify their interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression were not sufficient to establish convincingly that it was necessary in a democratic society to dismiss them even taking into account the difficult political situation at the time and allowing the national authorities a certain margin of appreciation to dismiss the applicants from their posts as diplomats was disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued,,,
38,the applicant was born in and lives in debrecen he is a practising lawyer and member of the békés county bar association at the material time the applicant was appearing as the legal representative of a hunting association before the battonya district court on march he filed with the court a notice of appeal for the attention of the secondinstance békés county regional court in which he also requested this court to initiate proceedings with a view to examining the firstinstance judges competence to exercise the duties of a judge in his appeal he wrote inter alia of course we do not assume any professional incompetence on the side of the sitting judge thus the fact that he appointed a guardian ad litem despite explicit objectionis the first proof of his bias questioning whether or not the general assembly of the respondent was entitled to suspend its session continue at a later point and call another general assembly is not a question of bias but that of clearcut professional incompetence because the judgment reflected the personal opinion of the judge and was not based on any evidence we can not but call into question the professional competence of the sitting judge his conduct was guided either by sympathy for the plaintiff or a dislike for the respondent and this was also represented in the judgment in a state based on the rule of law where proceedings should be based on the constitutional independence of judges such judicial bias can not be permissible based on the above besides our request for appeal we also request the county regional court to forward our motion to the authority responsible for initiating proceedings to examine the professional incompetence of the judge the motion was transferred to the békés county regional court whose vicepresident indicated to the békés county bar association that in his view the applicants submissions should give rise to disciplinary proceedings on april the president of the bar association informed the applicant about the opening of disciplinary proceedings on april the applicant submitted his observations contesting the initiation of the disciplinary proceedings in the ensuing proceedings the szeged bar association disciplinary board dealt with the case on june it fined the applicant hungarian forints huf approximately euros eur for having committed a serious disciplinary offence on appeal on november the national bar association disciplinary board upheld this decision in essence the applicant sought judicial review on september the budapest regional court remitted the case to the disciplinary instances essentially on procedural grounds in the resumed disciplinary proceedings on april the disciplinary board fined the applicant huf eur for having committed a deliberate disciplinary offence the board was of the opinion that the expressions of course we do not assume any professional incompetence on the side of the sitting judge this is not a question of bias but that of clearcut professional incompetence and we can not but call into question the professional competence of the sitting judge amounted to disrespecting the courts dignity and to denying the judge the requisite respect this was a disciplinary offence consisting of the applicants breaching the relevant ethical obligations on november the national bar association disciplinary board upheld this decision endorsing the firstinstance disciplinary boards position that the tone and language of the impugned statement was unacceptable and prejudicial to the reputation of lawyers on june the budapest regional court dismissed the applicants action challenging the disciplinary sanction the court did not agree with the applicants contention that in expressing the impugned statements he had merely exercised his procedural rights that is that he had requested the exclusion of the sitting judge for bias it also found that the statements had accused the court as an institution and not merely the sitting judge of circumventing the law on april the supreme court rejected the applicants petition for review endorsing the regional courts reasoning it dismissed the applicants argument that the disciplinary measure had infringed his procedural right exercised in his capacity as defence counsel to lodge a motion for bias reiterating the regional courts findings the supreme court held that contrary to what the applicant had argued his notice submitted following the closing of the firstinstance proceedings see paragraph above could not possibly serve the purpose of seeking the exclusion of the sitting judge for bias it further found that in as much as the applicants request could be interpreted as initiating proceedings to have the judges professional competence examined the reason for which he had been subjected to a disciplinary measure was not the very request but its tone ii relevant domestic law act no xi of on attorneys at law provides as follows disciplinary offence section a disciplinary offence is committed by an attorneya who wrongfully breaches the obligations arising from the exercise of the practice of his profession or the duties specified in the code of ethics for attorneys orb whose culpable conduct not performed as part of his attorney activities diminishes the prestige of attorneys as a group regulation no iii mük of the national bar association on the ethical rules and expectations pertaining to attorneys profession provides as follows attorneys are to maintain the dignity of official proceedings in particular the dignity of court hearings attorneys are bound to respect the dignity of the court in hearings and proceedings attorneys shall behave towards members of the courts and other authorities in compliance with the traditions of the profession by showing and demanding due honour and respect section of the act on attorneys at law and section of regulation no vi mük of the national bar association provide for the following disciplinary penalties a reprimand a fine not exceeding double the amount of the fine imposed for minor offences and removal from the bar roll the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that his right to express himself freely in his capacity as an attorney had been violated in that he had been fined for a disciplinary offence for infringing the dignity of the judiciary he relied on articles and of the convention the court considers that this complaint falls to be examined under article alone the relevant part of which provides as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to impart information and ideas without interference by public authority the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions the government admitted that imposing a fine for a disciplinary offence amounted to an interference with the applicants freedom of speech however they argued that the interference had been in accordance with the law pursued a legitimate aim and been necessary in a democratic society in particular the decision to fine the applicant had been based on section a of the act on attorneys at law and meant to maintain the authority of the judiciary the government also considered that the interference had been proportionate to its aim for the following reasons they first emphasised that the domestic courts had solved the conflict between the applicants right to freedom of expression and the protection of the courts dignity by weighing the relevant interests at stake in a manner reconcilable with the principles embodied in article of the convention according to the government the applicant had overstepped the limits of freedom of expression by using a tone and language disrespectful to the courts dignity and by referring to the professional unfitness of the sitting judge in their view the applicants statements had also suggested that the court as a whole assisted in the circumvention of the law the government also submitted that the applicant could have used a different manner to express his dissatisfaction when filing his motion for bias he could have applied expressions not injurious to the courts dignity the government further argued that the nature and severity of the imposed sanction was a factor to be taken into consideration in assessing the proportionality of the interference in the present case the applicant had sustained a fine of huf an amount which could not be considered disproportionate the applicant submitted that his remarks had been expressed in a motion for bias in exercise of his procedural rights under the code on civil procedure he had only intended to call attention to the performance of the sitting judge in a particular case and his motion had contained all relevant reasons to substantiate his statements the courts assessment the court reiterates that article is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb see for example mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no echr extracts furthermore freedom of expression protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed but also the form in which they are conveyed see for example kyprianou v cyprus gc no echr xiii and mariapori v finland no july it is not disputed between the parties and the court sees no reason to hold otherwise that fining the applicant for a disciplinary offence amounted to an interference with his freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the convention the court notes that freedom of expression is subject to exceptions set out in article of the convention it observes that the interference with the applicants freedom of expression was based on sections a and of act no xi of it was thus prescribed by law moreover it is undisputed that it pursued the legitimate aim of maintaining the authority of the judiciary within the meaning of article therefore the only question for the court to determine is whether that interference was necessary in a democratic society in so doing the court must ascertain whether the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see among many other authorities jersild v denmark september series a no and that a fair balance was struck between on the one hand the need to protect the authority of the judiciary and on the other hand the protection of the applicants freedom of expression see žugić v croatia no may according to the courts wellestablished caselaw the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with a european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court see janowski v poland gc no echr i the scope of the domestic power of appreciation is not identical as regards each of the aims listed in article the domestic law and practice of the contracting states reveal a fairly substantial measure of common ground in the area of authority of the judiciary this is reflected in a number of provisions of the convention including article accordingly here a more extensive european supervision corresponds to a less discretionary power of appreciation see the sunday times v the united kingdom no april series a no the court further reiterates that the phrase authority of the judiciary includes in particular the notion that the courts are and are accepted by the public at large as being the proper forum for the ascertainment of legal rights and obligations and the settlement of disputes relative thereto further that the public at large have respect for and confidence in the courts capacity to fulfil that function see the sunday times cited above the work of the courts which are the guarantors of justice and which have a fundamental role in a state governed by the rule of law needs to enjoy public confidence it should therefore be protected against unfounded attacks however the courts as with all other public institutions are not immune from criticism and scrutiny see skałka v poland no may therefore while parties are certainly entitled to comment on the administration of justice in order to protect their rights their criticism must not overstep certain bounds see saday v turkey no march in particular a clear distinction must be made between criticism and insult if the sole intent of any form of expression is to insult a court or members of that court an appropriate sanction would not in principle constitute a violation of article of the convention see skałka loc cit moreover the special status of lawyers gives them a central position in the administration of justice as intermediaries between the public and the courts such a position explains the usual restrictions on the conduct of members of the bar see casado coca v spain february series a no athe role of counsels to defend their clients interests involves their choice on the relevance and usefulness of an argument they can find themselves in the delicate situation where they have to decide whether or not they should object to or complain about the conduct of the court keeping in mind their clients best interests they might for instance feel constrained in their choice of pleadings procedural motions etc during proceedings before the courts possibly to the potential detriment of their clients case for the public to have confidence in the administration of justice they must have confidence in the ability of the legal profession to provide effective representation it follows that any chilling effect of even a relatively light penalty is an important factor to be considered in striking the appropriate balance between courts and lawyers in the context of an effective administration of justice see kyprianou v cyprus gc cited above turning to the facts of the present case the court notes that in its decision of june the budapest regional court found that the applicants statements made in his notice of appeal were insulting both to the sitting judge and the court as an institution see paragraph above this finding was endorsed by the supreme court in its decision of april adding that the reason for the disciplinary measure was not the applicants challenging the sitting judges professional conduct as such but the tone of his submissions see paragraph above the supreme court took into consideration whether the disciplinary fine actually affected the applicants rights as counsel see paragraph above it found that his right to express his disagreement with the firstinstance decision and the conduct of the sitting judge had not been restricted it established that since it had been lodged after the conclusion of the firstinstance proceedings the remarks contained in the notice of appeal could not be considered as a motion for bias against the firstinstance judge but only as the applicants personal opinion furthermore according to the domestic courts the applicant was not fined for having challenged the firstinstance judges competence to serve as a judge but for having used a tone for his criticism which had been injurious to the dignity of the judiciary see paragraph above the court notes that the present case bears similarities to meister v germany nos and commission decisions of october and april respectively unreported where counsel had made insulting statements about judges and other persons whom he regarded as having decided or acted incorrectly in the context of or in relation to court proceedings to wr v austria no commission decision of june unreported where counsel had described the opinion of a judge as ridiculous to mahler v germany no commission decision of january unreported where counsel had asserted that the prosecutor had drafted the bill of indictment in a state of complete intoxication to a v finland dec no january where the applicant had been issued with a warning for his statements of a disparaging nature submitted in a written appeal concerning the presiding judge to saday cited above where the accused had described the turkish judiciary as executioners dressed in gowns and to žugić cited above where the applicants notice of appeal had used a langue implying that the judge as a person was arrogant and incompetent to exercise the duty of a judge the court reiterates in this context that while lawyers are certainly entitled to comment in public on the administration of justice their criticism must not overstep certain bounds in that connection account must be taken of the need to strike the right balance between the various interests involved which include the publics right to receive information about questions arising from judicial decisions the requirements of the proper administration of justice and the dignity of the legal profession see schmidt v austria no july in the present case the applicant acted as the legal representative of a client in civil proceedings in the written submissions which he prepared acting in that capacity he accused the sitting judge of professional incompetence it follows that in the circumstances of the present case the requirement of protection of the interest of the proper administration of justice and the dignity of the legal profession is not to be weighed against the interest in the open discussion of matters of public concern or freedom of the press see mutatis mutandis nikula v finland no echr ii the court also notes that the impugned statements were not only a criticism of the reasoning in the judgment but as found by the disciplinary board and the domestic courts amounted to belittling the sitting judges professional capacities and implied that the court in question had circumvented the law having regard to the impugned remarks themselves in part sarcastic in part overtly insulting see paragraph above the court does not find this assessment unreasonable furthermore there is nothing to suggest that the applicant could not have raised the substance of his criticism of the reasoning in the decision without using the impugned language see mutatis mutandis steur v the netherlands no echr xi where the applicant lawyers criticism of a police officer in court did not amount to a personal insult and was strictly limited to the officers actions relevant to his clients case as distinct from criticism of his general professional or other qualities moreover the fine complained of was imposed on the applicant by the bar association for the breach of the ethical rules of the legal profession the court notes that the applicant as a lawyer was bound by the rules of professional conduct and finds it legitimate to expect him to contribute to the proper administration of justice and thus to maintain public confidence in it see schöpfer v switzerland may reports of judgments and decisions iii finally in assessing the proportionality of the interference the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are also factors to be taken into account see ceylan v turkey gc no echr iv in this respect the court notes that the applicant was merely fined in an amount not excessive in the course of disciplinary proceedings which were not made public and had no consequences on his right to exercise his profession the present case can thus be distinguished from the case of nikula cited above in which a criminal sanction albeit a lenient one was imposed on the applicant having regard to the foregoing the court considers that the reasons advanced by the disciplinary board and the domestic courts were sufficient and relevant to justify the interference and that the sanction imposed on the applicant was not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued the interference can thus reasonably be considered necessary in a democratic society to protect the judiciary within the meaning of article consequently there has been no violation of article of the convention ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant further complained that the length of the proceedings was incompatible with the reasonable time requirement of article of the convention the government did not contest that argument the period to be taken into consideration began at the latest on april when the applicant contested the initiation of disciplinary proceedings see philis v greece no june reports of judgments and decisions iv and ended on april when the supreme court gave a final decision the period thus lasted some seven years for the proceedings before the bar and for two judicial instances in view of such lengthy proceedings this complaint must be declared admissible the court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria the complexity of the case the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute see among many other authorities frydlender v france gc no echr vii the court has frequently found violations of article of the convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present application see frydlender cited above having examined all the material submitted to it the court considers that the government have not put forward any fact or convincing argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present circumstances having regard to its caselaw on the subject the court finds that the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the reasonable time requirement there has accordingly been a breach of article of the convention iii application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court finds that there has been a violation of the convention or the protocols thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party a damage the applicant claimed euros eur in respect of pecuniary damage and euros in respect of nonpecuniary damage the government left the matter to the discretion of the court the court notes that it has found a violation only in respect of the length of proceedings any compensation should therefore reflect that fact the court considers that the applicant must have suffered some nonpecuniary damage on account of the violation of his rights under article of the convention and awards him on the basis of equity eur under this head b costs and expenses the applicant also claimed eur for the costs and expenses incurred exclusively before the domestic courts the government contested this claim according to the courts caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum in the present case the court notes that the costs incurred in the domestic proceedings have no connection with its finding of a violation of the reasonable time requirement of article furthermore the court notes that the applicant who was not represented by a lawyer in the proceedings before the court has not submitted any claims in connection with the convention proceedings consequently the court rejects the applicants costs claim c default interest the court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the european central bank to which should be added three percentage points for these reasons the court unanimously declares the application admissible holds that there has been a violation of article of the convention holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention holdsa that the respondent state is to pay the applicant within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with article of the convention eur one thousand five hundred euros in respect of nonpecuniary damage to be converted into the currency of the respondent state at the rate applicable at the date of settlementb that from the expiry of the abovementioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage points dismisses the remainder of the

to the european court of human rights and later by his successor in that office mr m vinogradov the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as followspublic event of october in the run up to the legislative elections of december and the presidential election of march a number of public events in support of the acting president mr v putin were held in russia the applicant a human rights activist decided to attend one such public gathering aimed at supporting the economic and political ideas of mr putin on october he went to the event together with mr b the public

examined by the domestic court see paragraph below two participants of the assembly were displeased by the banner and asked the applicant and mr b to remove it but the applicant and mr b continued displaying it then police officers who were present at the venue ordered the applicant and mr b to remove the banner but they refused to do so they continued to be present at the meeting holding their banner at the end of the meeting three people in plain clothes approached the applicant and mr b seized their banner and teared it up the applicant alleged that those people were undercover police officers on the way home the applicant was approached by police officers who took him and mr b to a police station and kept them there while an administrativeoffence report was prepared the applicants conviction on the same day a justice of the peace of the st circuit of the tsentralniy district of novosibirsk examined the administrative case against the applicant on the basis of the police footage from the site of the public gathering the court established that the applicant had unfurled a provocative banner which ran contrary to the programme of the event people present at the meeting reacted negatively and asked the applicant to remove the banner in that situation the police officers lawfully ordered him to remove the banner see paragraphs and below because its display posed a real threat to public order health and lives of the participants however in breach of section of the public events act see paragraph below the applicant refused to follow that order in the courts view his conduct amounted to a breach of the established rules for the conduct of public events an offence under article of the code of administrative offences hereafter the cao see paragraph below the court fined the applicant for russian roubles rub equivalent to euros eur the applicant then appealed to the tsentralniy district court of novosibirsk which examined his appeal on november the court endorsed the findings of the lower court in particular it noted that the applicant had not disputed the facts of the case the court agreed with the assessment of the provocative content of the banner and with the assessment of threat to public order posed by the applicant according to the tsentralniy district court of novosibirsk the legal classification of the offence was correct and the fine was not disproportionate relevant legal framework the federal law on gatherings meetings demonstrations processions and pickets no fz of june the public events act provides that the participants in a public event must comply with lawful instructions of the organisers orders by the authorities and by the police the participants also must maintain public order and follow the events programme section according to the public events act police may inter alia order that the organisers and participants in the public event follow the rules for the conduct of that event they also may remove at the

until june provided that a breach of the established rules for the conduct of public events was punishable by a fine of rub to for the organisers of the event and rub to for the participants the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained of a violation of article of the convention on account of his conviction of an administrative offence and the fine imposed on him as a result of that conviction article of the convention in the relevant part reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the government submitted that the applicant had not suffered a significant disadvantage within the meaning of article b of the convention because the fine imposed on him had been modest and his case had been duly considered by the domestic courts the applicant submitted that the fine irrespective of its amount constituted a disproportionate interference with his freedom of expression the court observes that the fine of eur was indeed modest and the applicant did not advance any arguments to demonstrate that it had been significant to him in the light of his personal situation the court reiterates however that a violation of the convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage regardless of pecuniary interest see korolev v russia dec no july considering that the applicant was found guilty of and fined for an act which had in his view amounted to a proper exercise of his right to freedom of expression on a matter of public interest see paragraph above the alleged violation of article of the convention in the present case concerns important questions of principle compare obote v russia no november and handzhiyski v bulgaria no april the court thus finds that he has suffered a significant disadvantage accordingly it dismisses the governments objection pertaining to article b of the convention the court further notes that the applicants complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merits submissions by the parties the applicant submitted that the interference with his right to freedom of expression had not been necessary in a democratic society even if his banner could have seemed provocative or shocking to some it was not offensive for the participants or organisers of the event none of them expressed any displeasure at the sight of the banner it was not shown that his conduct posed any threat to public order peoples health or lives the applicant did not participate in any acts of violence there had been no pressing social need to take him to a police station since the administrativeoffence report could have been drawn up on the spot the government submitted that the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression had been prescribed by law had pursued the legitimate aims of protecting public order and public safety preventing disorder and crime and protecting the rights of others and had been necessary in a democratic society either the applicant had taken part in a public event that had not been notified to the authorities or he had taken part in a notified and approved public event in support of the president and had used a banner that had not corresponded to the events programme and aims and was offensive it might therefore have provoked the participants in the public event and led to public disorder indeed other participants in the event had been displeased and had asked the applicant to remove the banner the domestic courts had found that displaying the banner had created a real threat to peoples life and health and that the police order to remove it had therefore been lawful by failing to comply with that order the applicant breached the rules for the conduct of public events the penalty imposed on him was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued the courts assessmenta general principles for a summary of the relevant general principles see fáber v hungary no july b application of the general principles to the present casei existence of an interference the applicants claim that the circumstances of the case disclose an interference with his right to freedom of expression was not questioned by the government the court finds that the police order to remove the banner and the applicants conviction amounted to such interferenceii prescribed by law the court is satisfied with the lawfulness of the police order under section of the public events act the police had the power to require that the applicant refrain from any actions that could have led to a breach of public order or the rules for the conduct of a public event see paragraph above the applicants conviction of a breach of the established rules for the conduct of public events under article of the cao was based on the domestic courts finding that he had violated section of the public events act that act stipulated that the participants in a public event must comply with lawful police orders and maintain public order given that the failure to comply with the police order had not been contested by the applicant the court finds that his conviction had a sufficient basis in domestic lawiii legitimate aim the applicant was ordered to remove the banner and then convicted of an administrative offence because the authorities considered that his banner was provocative and could lead to disorder the court accepts that the interference pursued the legitimate aims of prevention of disorder and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others see fáber cited above iv necessity in a democratic society the impugned police order was based on the considerations that the banner did not correspond to the programme of the event was provocative and could result in unrest the applicant contested that assessment according to him the banner corresponded to the declared aims of the event and was not offensive its demonstration did not result in a breach of public order given that the domestic courts are better placed than the international judge to assess what is likely to be considered provocative and offensive by the society and that the text on the applicants banner was ambiguous the court gives credence to the finding by the domestic courts that the banner could in fact be perceived as offensive by some of the participants indeed comparing mr putin with adolf hitler could be seen as something other than support for the presidents policies the court therefore accepts the governments argument based on the assessment of the situation by the domestic authorities that the display of the banner could have resulted in a conflict between the applicant and the participants in the public event that fact by itself could not however justify an interference with the fundamental right provided for by article of the convention the court has already held that a demonstration may annoy or give offence to persons opposed to the ideas or claims that it is seeking to promote plattform ärzte für das leben v austria june series a no moreover it consistently underlined the importance of the right to counterdemonstration which could be held at the same time and venue with a demonstration see for example öllinger v austria no echr ix and fáber cited above july the right to counter demonstration however is not absolute as in a democracy it can not extend to inhibiting the exercise of the right to demonstrate see plattform ärzte für das leben cited above fáber cited above and berkman v russia no december moreover the contracting states have a duty to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable lawful demonstrations to proceed peacefully the united macedonian organisation ilinden and ivanov v bulgaria no october the aforementioned principles formulated in cases concerning freedom of assembly are fully pertinent to the present case given that the applicant expressed his opinion during a public event bearing them in mind the court notes that it has not been shown that the police order to remove the banner was triggered by its content as such rather as the domestic courts found the police order was triggered by the applicants conduct considered provocative by some of the participants to the event and by their negative reaction indeed the applicant chose to raise the banner in the middle of a crowd of his opponents although nothing prevented him from taking a place in an adjacent area see by contrast fáber cited above where the applicant held a counterdemonstration outside of the crowd of protestors the applicants location among the demonstrators was a key factor the applicants banner distorted and undermined the message that other participants and the overall demonstration wanted to convey which was in support of mr putin it also made it difficult for the police to ensure the peaceful conduct of the event when the risk of unrest started materialising in a form of a conflict between the applicant and his opponents the police invited the applicant and mr b to remove the banner the police officers were best positioned to evaluate the security risks and those of disturbance as well as the appropriate measures dictated by the risk assumption their order to remove the banner therefore does not appear to have been unreasonable or excessive see by contrast berkman cited above where the court criticised the police inaction and can thus considered proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued the court lastly notes that the applicant was not removed from the meeting taking that into account his conviction of an administrative offence and the fine of eur which is the minimal sanction for a breach of article of the cao do not appear to be excessive see by contrast navalnyy v russia gc nos and others november where the court held that the amount of fine imposed on the applicant was immaterial if the public assembly was dispersed by the police compare to rai and evans v the united kingdom dec nos and november and ziliberberg v moldova dec no may where the imposition of fines was not found to be a disproportionate interference with freedom of peaceful assembly in the light of the above the court concludes that the measures complained of by the applicant did not in the specific circumstances of the case go beyond what was necessary in a democratic society there has therefore been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the courtdeclares unanimously the application admissible holds by five votes to two that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on february pursuant to rule and of the rules of court olga chernishova georges ravarani deputy registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgmenta сoncurring opinion of judge ravaranib joint concurring opinion of judges elósegui and zündc dissenting opinion of judge seibert fohr joined by judge pavli groc concurring opinion of judge ravarani i am in agreement with the conclusion reached by the majority of judges that in the circumstances of the case there has been no violation of article i should like however to make clear that i reached that conclusion only because of the specificity of the known facts and moreover lacunae in the presentation of other facts which might have been relevant for the assessment of the alleged violation based on the available information it appears to me that the case was not about i the applicants allegedly impaired right to express his opinions but rather ii his noncompliance with a legal and proportionate police order based on the risk of degeneration of the peaceful conduct of the gathering into which he had introduced himself as a matter of fact the applicant and mr b were not actually prevented from expressing their opinion at any point during the demonstration it is true as stated in paragraph of the judgment that the police invited them to remove the provocative banner but they refused to do so moreover they were able to remain in the middle of the pro putin gathering and to display their banner during the entire meeting until its very end so there actually was no concrete impediment to expressing their opinion it is true that at some point the police invited them to remove their banner i am in agreement with the majority that there was a genuine risk to the peaceful conduct of the event and it appears quite astonishing that only two participants in the demonstration showed discontent with the provocative banner being displayed in their midst the police did not to my mind take an unreasonable or excessive step in inviting the applicant and mr b to remove their banner on the contrary such action showed sound riskassessment it is futile to speculate on how the police would have reacted had they stepped out of the demonstration and displayed their banner outside the pro putin crowd in a quite visible way using their right to counterdemonstrate had there had been an intervention by the police in such a situation there would certainly have been an issue under that right in this context i feel obliged to distance myself from the statement contained in paragraph of the judgment according to which the applicants banner distorted and undermined the message that other participants and the overall demonstration wanted to convey which was in support of mr putin as it is highly ambiguous and could be understood as restricting the right to counterdemonstrate which is protected by article of the convention see the references to the courts caselaw in that field in paragraph of the judgment it is also true that once the gathering was over the police stepped in and took the applicant to the police station in order to record the administrative offence of noncompliance with a legal order it appears to me that as a matter of fact the applicant had indeed failed to abide by such an order this did not in itself impair his freedom of expression as it does not appear from the facts that the given order was aimed at preventing him from expressing his opinions but rather at avoiding uproar and violence as the applicant actually continued to display his banner and did not step out of the gathering had he done so and the police had nevertheless recorded an administrative offence an issue under article would certainly have arisen the fact of taking the applicant to the police station could have given rise to a violation of convention guarantees if it had been shown that it was triggered by the content of his banner rather than by the refusal to abide by an invitation that quite legitimately tried to minimise a risk of physical violence not least directed against the applicant and mr b themselves there could also have been a convention issue if the applicant had been taken by force to the police station and been obliged to remain in the premises longer than necessary to draw up the offence record however the facts surrounding this episode are unknown or at the least unexplained see paragraph of the judgment and the applicant has not lodged a complaint under article of the convention joint concurring opinion of judgeselósegui and zünd in the present case of manannikov v russia we have voted with the majority because we agree with the finding that there has been no violation of article of the convention the reason for our concurring opinion is to emphasise one of the elements which ought to be taken into consideration as a limitation on the right to freedom of expression namely the rights of expression of other citizens we agree with the reasoning in the judgment to the effect that there is a double reason for finding no violation namely the legitimate aims of protecting the rights of others and preventing a disturbance of public order our caveat is that in the current circumstances different parts of the population demonstrate on an increasingly frequent basis in public spaces because they hold different opinions about social matters such as for instance the policies imposed by states with regard to pandemicrelated publichealth measures we are living in tense societies all around europe for very different causes and reasons in our view what it is important under article is that those citizens who have requested official permission to demonstrate in one or another direction should be able to do so without being hampered by other citizens who think differently in the present case the fact that the applicant mr manannikov introduced himself into the middle of an authorised demonstration distorted the message that the other participants wished to express in fact by displaying a banner stating that putin is better than hitler he changed the overall image of the demonstration which was intended to express support for mr putin in our view this behaviour of course increased the risk of conflict but moreover it also failed to respect the rights of others to freedom of expression the applicant is free to think in another way but he is not entitled to impede others from expressing their views in the way that he did the caselaw of the court has insisted on the idea that the exercise of one individuals freedom may be limited if it impedes the rights of others for instance in the case of steel and others v the united kingdom september reports of judgments and decisions vii the first applicant together with approximately sixty others took part in a protest against a grouse shoot on wheeldale moor yorkshire ibid she was arrested for a breach of the peace moreover according to the police she was intentionally impeding the progress of a member of the shoot by walking in front of him as he lifted his shotgun to take aim thus preventing him from firing ibid she was further charged with using threatening abusive or insulting words or behaviour within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment alarm or distress ibid the court found that the measures taken against her had not given rise to a violation of article we would like to emphasise that the court has consistently underlined the importance of the right to counterdemonstration which could be held at the same time and venue as a demonstration see for example öllinger v austria no echr ix and fáber v hungary no july see paragraph of the present judgment however this right to counterdemonstration is not absolute and it has to respect the rights of others see plattform ärzte für das leben v austria june series a no fáber cited above and berkman v russia no december see also paragraph of the present judgment this was not so in the present case as outlined in paragraph above dissenting opinion of judge seibertfohrjoined by judge pavli while we agree with the majority that there has been an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression we come to a different conclusion with respect to its necessity whereas the contracting states enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent an interference is necessary this margin goes hand in hand with european supervision when carrying out that supervision the court must ascertain whether the impugned measures are proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued due regard being had to the importance of freedom of expression in a democratic society see perinçek v switzerland gc no december in our view it has not been shown in the present case that it was necessary to take and hold the applicant at a police station for several hours after the demonstration had ended let alone to impose a fine on him the government have failed to demonstrate that there were no less restrictive means at their disposal to protect public order see glor v switzerland no echr we agree with the majority that public authorities may legitimately intervene in cases where public order is at stake and take action in order to avoid conflicts between demonstrators and counterdemonstrators as the court has explained in ärzte für das leben v austria no june in a democracy the right to counterdemonstrate can not extend to inhibiting the exercise of the right to demonstrate genuine effective freedom of peaceful assembly can not therefore be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the state not to interfere article sometimes requires positive measures to be taken even in the sphere of relations between individuals if need be therefore states may be required to take positive measures in order to protect a lawful demonstration against counterdemonstrations see also öllinger v austria no june for this reason it may be necessary to take steps to deescalate tensions before a real risk of inflicting bodily harm materialises see berkman v russia no december what kind of measures are permissible will depend on the particular situation at hand in fáber v hungary no july the court considered that the state had had a positive obligation to protect the right of assembly of both demonstrating groups by identifying the least restrictive means that would in principle enable both demonstrations to take place in the present case the authorities have failed to demonstrate that the order to remove the banner followed by the imposition of a fine on the applicant was indeed necessary to protect public order the applicants conduct was neither threatening nor abusive he did not hinder other participants from participating or expressing their views the reason for the applicants conviction was the fact that he displayed a banner which was considered provocative compare fáber v hungary cited above two participants in the event were displeased by the banner and asked for its removal see paragraph of the judgment however the applicants refusal to take the banner down did not lead to any further reactions by other participants the banner continued to be displayed until the end of the event without any further incident nonetheless the police took the applicant to a police station after the meeting had ended in their submissions see paragraph the government argue that the divergence from the events programme might have provoked the participants in the public event and led to public disorder however repressive measures can not be based on such hypothetical effects inviting the police to decide on their own which views are consistent with an events programme would significantly undermine the right to freedom of expression an expression which is considered to be provocative is therefore in itself insufficient to justify intervention if provocative expressions do in fact lead to a disruption of the main event or to tensions with other demonstrators who consider the message of the event to be distorted preventative deescalating measures need to be considered such as separating the demonstrators on site while allowing both groups an opportunity to express their views see öllinger v austria cited above in the present case however the police did not consider such preventative measures to be necessary the applicant was not directed to an adjacent area in order to avoid tensions with the other participants or to prevent the alleged distortion of the event and disruption to its participants instead the police waited until the applicant was already on his way home before sanctioning him the course of events thus contradicts the assumption that the applicants presence rendered it difficult for the police to ensure the peaceful conduct of the event we acknowledge that during a public event the police are required to determine the appropriate measures on the basis of an ex ante evaluation of the security risks and the likelihood of disturbance however this does not absolve the authorities from pointing to concrete facts such as actual disruption prior disturbances or violent acts in past events in order to establish a pressing social need to prohibit the expression of an opinion moreover based on the relevant risk assessment the police need to resort to the least restrictive measures see fáber v hungary cited above we are doubtful that the discomfort experienced by two other demonstrators with regard to the banner was sufficient to justify the order to remove it entirely rather than asking the applicant to move to an adjacent area at a sufficient distance from the demonstrators in any event once subsequent events showed that the alleged risk of disorder the assumption of which had been hasty did not materialise there were no grounds for taking the applicant to the police station after the event holding him there and sentencing him to a fine for these reasons and in the absence of any demonstration of a pressing social need for the applicants conviction we would have found a violation of article in the present case,,,
40,the first applicant organisation is the vienna chamber of medical doctors ärztekammer für wien the chamber represents all medical practitioners in vienna and also has its own website the second applicant was the chambers president at the time of the events a statement in issue and injunction proceedings on january the second applicant published a letter on the first applicant organisations website which was addressed to all members of the chamber in vienna and was also sent out to all of them via email the letter was titled locust funds want to take over medical practices heuschreckenfonds wollen ordinationen übernehmen the second applicant went on to state that he had been forced to write to his colleagues for a serious reason namely because it had been reported in the media that the f company planned to go into the radiology business he added that sharebidding companies planned to offer medical services initially in the area of radiology but soon enough in other areas of the profession as well and that doctors risked becoming mere employees of such locust companies if they would not act according to the companies wishes they would be dismissed the second applicant then explained the assumed legal and organisational basis of such a plan radiology services which were currently being provided by medical practices could in future also be offered by limited companies shares of those companies could then be bought by the f company and the locusts would reach their goal namely control of the medical profession giving an example of a risky development the second applicant stated that in the last years colleagues had founded laboratories which had reciprocal agreements with certain health insurance boards today almost all of those laboratories were owned by the f group which in turn was owned by insurance companies investment funds and foundations and which employed a large number of doctors the second applicant ended his letter by stating that he could guarantee one thing that the doctors professional representative body would make use of all legal and political means available to stop such a disastrous development from going ahead to prevent that the quality of medical treatment being determined by managers and controllers and to ensure inter alia that existing medical practices were protected from the competition from international locust funds internationale heuschreckenfonds on january the f company lodged an action against the two applicants and an application for an injunction with the vienna commercial court handelsgericht wien the applicants contested the application on february the vienna commercial court issued an injunction prohibiting the applicants each of them individually from repeating the statement that the f company was ruthless towards third parties in particular medical professionals the injunction prevented the applicants from referring to the f company as a locust locust company or locust fund the applicants were further prohibited from stating that the provision of services by the f company particularly services in the area of radiology was a disastrous development the court found that there was a competitive relationship between the f company and the applicants and found the statements made by the applicants to be defamatory under article of the civil code and unethical under the unfair competition act bundesgesetz gegen den unlauteren wettbewerb the applicants appealed against the injunction on october the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht wien partly granted the appeal and prohibited the applicants from alleging that the f company was ruthless towards third parties and medical practitioners and from calling it inter alia a locust company however it dismissed the f companys application to prohibit the applicants from calling its provision of services a disastrous development the court of appeal found that the first applicant organisation had locus standi in the injunction proceedings the chamber of medical doctors held official authority status in relation to certain areas of its work bereich der hoheitsverwaltung in addition to representing the interests of its members it was therefore considered a legal entity under the official liability act amtshaftungsgesetz however when acting as a special interest group it represented its members interests from a mainly economic perspective rather than acting in its capacity as an official authority according to the court of appeal the letter in issue pursued the interests of the chambers members outside the chambers official sphere of activity the court of appeal further established referring inter alia to wikipedia that the term locust company heuschreckenunternehmen was introduced into the political discussion in german speaking countries in by mr franz müntefering a german politician and is ever since used in political debates as a pejorative term for privateequity companies or other forms of capital funds with shortterm or exaggerated return expectations like hedge funds or vulture funds which also had negative connotations the domestic court found that there was a need to balance the interests involved in the present debate reiterating that extreme opinions were only unlawful if they were excessive as a result of that balancing exercise the court of appeal found that the locust statement had to be considered a lawful criticism in the context of a public debate and that the f company could therefore not base its claim on article of the civil code however the court of appeal classified the applicants actions as competitive in nature statements of fact made in violation of the unfair competition act could not be justified by the right to freedom of expression the court of appeal found that austrian law provided wideranging protection for commercial and economic interests those who published an opinion in an economically competitive context were obliged to exercise a higher level of diligence with regard to the facts and bases of their allegations than those who acted in the noncompetitive context of a public debate of general interest therefore the court of appeal upheld the injunction decision with regard to the statements about the locust company however as regards the further statement namely that provision of certain services by the f company was a disastrous development the court of appeal found that read in context the statement indicated a general assessment and did not refer to a particular service of the f company it was therefore to be considered a personal opinion and thus a value judgment that was not defamatory under article of the civil code it also did not fall under section of the unfair competition act the applicants lodged an extraordinary appeal with the supreme court oberster gerichtshof on january the supreme court dismissed the extraordinary appeal it acknowledged the applicants argument that where a competitor even for economic purposes took part in a debate of public interest freedom of expression had to hold more weight in the balancing test however the supreme court observed that the applicants had made their statement in the clearly economic context of competition between medical practitioners and companies which provided the same services the applicants could have warned their members of the possible risks of cooperating with companies without overstepping the margin of acceptable criticism however the applicants had exceeded that limit and stated that the f company was a locust that statement was one of fact and the applicants had not provided evidence of a factual basis for their allegations and had therefore exceeded the permissible limitations of freedom of expression b substantive proceedings on july the commercial court gave its judgment in the substantive proceedings and ordered the applicants to refrain from repeating the statement that the f company was ruthless towards third parties in particular medical practitioners and patients and stating that the f company was a locust company a locust fund or a locust it further ordered the applicants to publish and display the operative part of the judgment on the first applicant organisations website for thirty days and to publish it in the first applicant organisations print newsletter the commercial court made substantial reference to the court of appeals reasoning in the interim injunction proceedings it followed the previous finding that the relevant statements did not constitute defamation pursuant to article of the civil code examining the statements in relation to the provisions of the unfair competition act the commercial court found that the letter had been written by the chamber of medical doctors in a commercial and not a political context it had also had the advancement of independent medical practices as an objective and had contained a warning regarding capital ventures which allegedly threatened doctors independence the commercial court found the relevant comparisons with locusts to be statements of fact regarding both the f company and its conduct in relation to third parties doctors and patients the statements were also likely to damage the f companys commercial interests and had not been proved to be true the used language could also not be justified with a reference to the right to freedom of expression as the statement was uttered within the framework of a commercial competitive relationship with reference to the courts caselaw allowing for a wider margin of appreciation under article of the convention with regard to commercial language the commercial court observed that a competitor was required to be more diligent in the context of commercial communication among competitors the term locust was almost exclusively loaded with negative meaning which led to the unethical general vilification of a competitor the applicants were therefore prohibited from using that statement in relation to the f company pursuant to the unfair competition act on september the applicants lodged an appeal against that judgment on december the vienna court of appeal dismissed the appeal as unfounded it referred to the extensive reasoning given in the interim injunction proceedings and added that according to the caselaw of the supreme court the test used to verify whether a statement was covered by the right to freedom of expression required the assessment of whether a factual basis for such a statement existed if a competitor participated in a public debate of general interest freedom of expression had more weight with regard to the assessment of the statement than in the context of purely commercial communication the greater the public interest in being properly informed and the less the statement related to commercial interests the more the statement would be protected by article of the convention in the present case there was no doubt that there was an ongoing public debate however the commercial interests of the applicants had very much been in the foreground of the communicated statement itself the applicants lodged an extraordinary appeal on points of law against that judgment which was rejected by the supreme court on july the supreme court found that the applicants had not only called the f company a locust but had also reproached this company for negative conduct such as dominating doctors dismissing doctors who did not act in accordance with company wishes and focusing on economic factors rather than the welfare of patients herrschaft über den ärztlichen berufstand kündigung nicht spurender ärzte orientierung an ökonomischen erwägungen und damit nicht am wohl der patienten therefore the expression used had turned into a statement of fact giving the reader the impression that the f company had already demonstrated unethical conduct which threatened the interests of doctors and patients in view of the specific circumstances of the case the prohibition ruled upon by the lower courts was justified even though the applicants had taken part in a debate of general public interest an untrue and damaging statement of fact was not protected by freedom of expression furthermore the issuing of warnings concerning the potential risks of the provision of medical services by companies was not as such prohibited by the decisions of the austrian courts the applicants had only been required to refrain from making untrue statements of fact in respect of their competitors the decision of the supreme court was served on the applicants counsel on august ii relevant domestic lawa the chamber of medical doctors and the medical practitioners

fulfilled by exercising typically governmental powers such as the issuing of decrees in proceedings relating to decisions the first applicant organisation was bound by the general administrative procedure act allgemeines verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz and the enforcement of its decisions was based on the federal law for the enforcement of administrative orders verwaltungsvollstreckungsgesetz the decrees issued by the first applicant organisation were supervised by the vienna regional government which had powers to suspend them therefore the first applicant organisation was not fully independent as required by the courts caselaw moreover the relevant statement had been issued in the process of discharging the first applicant organisations legal public responsibilities the first applicant organisation contested that assertion it was true that legally it was a public entity entrusted with the exercise of public functions it was therefore correct that it was in general required to safeguard fundamental rights but did not enjoy such rights however aside from this legal aspect it also had a nongovernmental aspect which rendered it capable of being a party under article of the convention the court should therefore not examine the general abilities of the organisation to use the powers conferred on it by law but the act in question itself the issuing of the statement was not an act of a governmental organisation but rather one of a privatelaw nature the court refers to its wellestablished case law to the effect that a legal entity claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the high contracting parties of the rights set forth in the convention or the protocols thereto may submit an application to the court provided that it is a nongovernmental organisation within the meaning of article of the convention the court reiterates that the idea behind this principle is to prevent a contracting party from acting as both an applicant and a respondent party before the court the term governmental organisations as opposed to nongovernmental organisations within the meaning of article includes legal entities which participate in the exercise of governmental powers or run a public service under government control the term governmental organisations applies not only to the central organs of the state but also to decentralised authorities that exercise public functions regardless of their autonomy visàvis the central organs likewise it applies to regional and local authorities including municipalities in order to determine whether any given legal person falls within one of the two above categories account must be taken of its legal status and where appropriate the rights that status gives it the nature of the activity it carries out the context in which it is carried out and the degree of its independence from the political authorities see radio france and others v france dec no echr x and islamic republic of iran shipping lines v turkey no echr v the court has therefore considered a company to be a nongovernmental organisation where it was governed essentially by company law did not enjoy any governmental or other powers beyond those conferred by ordinary private law in the exercise of its activities and was subject to the jurisdiction of the ordinary rather than the administrative courts in the past the court has also taken into account the fact that an applicant company carried out commercial activities and had neither a public service role nor a monopoly in a competitive sector see vỳchodoslovenská vodárenská spoločnosť as v slovakia dec no july state holding company luganksvugillya v ukraine dec no january and transpetrol as v slovakia dec no november with regard to austria the court has stated that communes and the chamber of commerce had to be seen as governmental organisations within the meaning of article see respectively austrian communes and some of their councillors v austria no commission decision of may and weiss v austria no commission decision of july however the austrian broadcasting corporation österreichischer rundfunk orf was not seen as an governmental organisation within the meaning of article as it did not exercise governmental powers and its independence and institutional autonomy had been preserved see österreichischer rundfunk v austria no december it is undisputed that the first applicant organisation exists by virtue of the legislature that thus provides its continued existence its legal status is therefore that of a publiclaw body and not an entity founded in accordance with private law the court observes further that the structure of the first applicant organisation is provided for by law and that membership is compulsory the relationship between the members and the governing body is defined by means of public law issued by the governing body and is not subject to the jurisdiction of the civil courts even the enforcement of payment of contributions arrears is a matter governed by the federal law for the enforcement of administrative orders further the court observes that the mission of the first applicant organisation is prescribed by the medical practitioners act as well as regards the nature of its activities on one hand it is undisputed that the first applicant organisation may in certain matters act as a private entity and can be held liable before the ordinary courts on the other hand there is agreement between the parties that the first applicant organisation exercises governmental powers and has a public service role in organising and managing the education of doctors and their access to employed and selfemployed work in exercising all these functions it is under the supervision of other state authorities all the chambers organs can be dismissed from office by the regional government under the section b of the medical practitioners act moreover the activities of the first applicant organisation are financed by compulsory and enforceable contributions of all medical practitioners in austria see para the court is not persuaded by the first appplicant organisations argument that in publishing the impugned article he did not exercise of any governmental powers within the meaning of article the impugned statement was clearly made in exercising the chambers public function accordingly the court concludes that the first applicant organisation is not a person nongovernmental organisation or group of individuals within the meaning of article of the convention in accordance with article it follows that the application is incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the convention the court must therefore reject the application of the first applicant organisation as inadmissible b the second applicants victim status the government further argued that the second applicant had acted as the president of the first applicant organisation and therefore as the head of a governmental organisation he had used the first applicant organisations website to publish his statement and had done this to fulfil his duties towards doctors his act should be regarded as governed by public law and his application should therefore be declared inadmissible ratione personae the second applicant contested that argument and emphasised that the national courts had found that he had not acted within the sphere of the duties conferred by public law otherwise the courts could not have prohibited him from repeating the statements in question the court reiterates that the term victim used in article of the convention denotes the person directly affected by the act or omission which is in issue see centro europa srl and di stefano v italy gc no echr in the present case the courts prohibited the second applicant a natural person from repeating the statement that the f company was ruthless towards third parties in particular medical professionals and from referring to the f company as a locust locust company or locust fund it was undisputed in the course of the domestic proceedings that the second applicant hereby acted as a representative of the first applicant however by addressing the court order explicitly also to the second applicant as a natural person it affected the second applicant individually therefore the court considers that the second applicant has standing to introduce the present application the governments objection is thus dismissed moreover the second applicants complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article of the convention the court further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it is therefore declared admissible ii alleged violation of article of the convention the second applicant complained of an infringement of his right to freedom of expression as a result of the measures imposed on him by domestic courts he relied on article of the convention which reads everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government accepted that there had been interference by public authority with the exercise of the applicants right to freedom of expression they contended however that that interference satisfied the requirements of the second paragraph of article an interference contravenes article of the convention unless it is prescribed by law pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph of article and in addition to being proportionate is necessary in a democratic society for achieving such aims a the parties submissions the second applicant accepted that the interference served a legitimate aim namely the protection of the reputation or rights of others within the meaning of article of the convention however in his view the imposed prohibition had not been lawful as section of the unfair competition act was not clear and a prohibition based on that law was therefore not foreseeable accordingly the interference was not prescribed by law as regards the necessity of the interference the second applicant emphasised that he had contributed to a debate of public interest and that in respect of public shareholder companies the limits of acceptable criticism were wider he acknowledged that the term locust had a negative meaning associated with privateequity funds however there had been a substantive factual basis for his allegations as the shareholders of the f company were also companies limited by shares and a privateequity fund was managing the holdings of one of the shareholders of the f company by calling the f company a locust company he had not intended to act competitively instead his intention had been to voice a pointed criticism of a process he considered unlawful the statement had aimed to point out the ongoing shift from the predominance of independent medical practitioners to a medical service determined by capital and the consequent risks involved for doctors and their work moreover the prohibition imposed by the domestic courts would prevent him from fulfilling his duties as president of the vienna chamber of medical doctors therefore the interference was also not proportionate the government submitted that the interference was prescribed by law as it had its basis in sections and of the unfair competition act those provisions were formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct as required by the courts caselaw in the field of competition law in particular an absolutely precise formulation could not be expected as business markets and ways of communicating would always be subject to change in addition the interference had pursued a legitimate aim in relation to the necessity of the interference the government submitted that the interference was based on grounds which were sufficient and relevant in terms of the aims pursued and was proportionate to those aims they accepted that the second applicant had taken part in a debate on a matter of public interest namely public health care in austria the domestic courts had issued decisions which in the past the court had accepted as being within the wide margin of appreciation in purely commercial matters the austrian courts had followed this caselaw and had considered the second applicants statement to be a statement of fact on that basis they had conducted a careful and detailed examination of the case and the parties arguments the second applicant had failed to prove the existence of these facts the fact that the f company was a company limited by shares was no proof that it would be ruthless towards its employees or act like a locust even if the statement had to be treated as a value judgment the second applicant had failed to show a sufficient factual basis to support his assertions the second applicant had acted for competitive purposes as he had stated himself at the firstinstance hearing moreover the courts had not prohibited the second applicant from warning against the alleged threats companies limited by shares would pose to the system of medical care in instances where such warnings had a sufficient factual basis the government further pointed out that the courts had not imposed a penalty but rather an obligation not to repeat the statement that the f company acted ruthlessly or was a locust therefore the interference with the second applicants rights was of minor effect it would not prevent him from participating in the ongoing debate about the impact of companies on medical services b the courts assessment prescribed by lawand legitimate aim the court reiterates that in the past it has held that section of the unfair competition act which prohibits unfair commercial practice or any other unfair action which might affect the competitive capability of a business in a significant way for competitive purposes was sufficiently precise for the purpose of article of the convention and accordingly that an interference based on that provision was prescribed by law within the meaning of article see krone verlag gmb h co kg v austria no no echr xii section of the unfair competition act defines conduct in more detail than section and in substance prohibits allegations being made or facts being disseminated about a competitors business for competitive purposes unless such facts are demonstrably true the court sees that provision as sufficiently precise for the purpose of article of the convention also the national courts orders to cease and desist are the legal consequences clearly outlined in section of that act therefore the court considers that the interference was prescribed by law namely by sections and of the unfair competition act moreover there is agreement between the parties that the interference served a legitimate aim namely the protection of the reputation or rights of others within the meaning of article of the convention the court shares this view necessary in a democratic society the court notes that in the present case the second applicant made a public statement which affected the reputation of the f company the right to protection of reputation is a right which is protected by article of the convention in order for article to come into play however an attack on a persons reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness see delfi as v estonia gc no echr the court has reiterated many times that in cases which require the right to respect for private life to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression the outcome of the application should not in theory vary according to whether it has been lodged with the court under article of the convention by the person who was the subject of the statement or under article by the person who made the statement indeed as a matter of principle these rights deserve equal respect see von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr the court reiterates that under its caselaw contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity of an interference but this margin is subject to european supervision as regards both the relevant rules and the decisions applying them see markt intern verlag gmb h and klaus beermann v germany november series a no the court has identified a number of criteria in the context of balancing the competing rights the relevant criteria thus defined are contribution to a debate of public interest the degree of notoriety of the person affected the subject of the news report the prior conduct of the person concerned the content form and consequences of the publication and where appropriate the circumstances in which the photographs were taken where it examines an application lodged under article the court will also examine the way in which the information was obtained and its veracity and the gravity of the penalty imposed on the person who made the statement see mutatis mutandis couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no november the court has also found that large public companies inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their acts and that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider in respect of such companies however in addition to the public interest in open debate about business practices there is a competing interest in protecting the commercial success and viability of companies not just for the benefit of shareholders and employees but also for the wider economic good therefore the state enjoys a margin of appreciation as to the means it provides under domestic law by which a company can challenge the truth and limit the damage of allegations which risk harming its reputation see steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii furthermore the court emphasises that a wider margin of appreciation entrusted to the states is essential in the complex and fluctuating area of unfair competition see krone verlag gmb h co kg no cited above and jacubowski v germany june series a no a however it is necessary to reduce the extent of the margin of appreciation when what is at stake is not an individuals purely commercial statement but his participation in a debate of general interest for example a debate about public health see hertel v switzerland august reports vi the court notes that in order to assess the justification of a statement which is in issue a distinction must be made between statements of fact and value judgments while the existence of facts can be demonstrated the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article however even where a statement amounts to a value judgment there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it the classification of a statement as one of fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities in particular the courts see lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc nos and echr iv however the court can change this classification under its supervisory role see kharlamov v russia no october pinto pinheiro marques v portugal no january turning to the circumstances of the present case the court notes that the domestic courts took the statement of january into consideration in its entirety and found that the statement was made in the clearly economic context of competing medical practices and capital companies providing the same services they acknowledged that where a competitor even for economic purposes took part in a debate of public interest freedom of expression had to hold more weight with regard to the balancing exercise however the term locust was almost exclusively loaded with negative meaning which led to an unethical general vilification of a competitor the word used gave the reader the impression that the f company had already demonstrated unethical conduct which harmed the interests of doctors and patients therefore the domestic courts judged the relevant statement to be one of fact the statement was also likely to damage the f companys commercial interests and had not been proved to be true the court considers that there is no need to further clarify whether the present statement was one of fact or a value judgment since a sufficient factual basis for it was needed in any case for a company which offers medical services the accusation that it acted as a locust which as can be seen from the context of the applicants letter also implied that the f company or similar companies placed economic interests above those of its patients was a particularly serious one which affected its reputation thus even if the applicant had intended to make that statement in the context of a wider debate on an issue of public concern he had to have a solid factual basis on which to base that allegation in the domestic proceedings the austrian courts after carefully examining the arguments put forward by the applicant concluded that there was no such factual basis and the applicant has likewise not provided any persuasive argument substantiating his allegations neither the fact that the shares in the f company are owned by other companies limited by shares and that one of those shareholders is managed by a privateequity fund nor the fact that financial resources for expansion are raised by debenture provides a factual basis for the unethical conduct typically associated with locust corporations in addition the fact that doctors are employees within the f company does not provide a factual basis for the second applicants allegations the general remarks by the second applicant concerning the future impact of the growing popularity of companies providing medical services are not related to any actions on the part of the f company therefore they can not provide a factual basis for his allegations against that company accordingly the court arrives at the conclusion that the prohibition imposed on the second applicant was based on relevant and sufficient grounds as regards the measures imposed on the second applicant the court notes that according to its caselaw the nature and severity of the interference imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing its proportionality see mutatis mutandis lindon otchakovsky laurens and july cited above and europapress holding doo v croatia no october the vienna commercial court did not impose a penalty but prohibited the second applicant from calling the f company ruthless by the term locust the second applicant was also ordered to publish the operative part of the vienna commercial courts judgment on the first applicant organisations website and in its print newsletter even if the second applicant now risks the imposition of fines for noncompliance with the injunction the nature and severity of the courts action was moderate the second applicant also failed to give reasons as to why the courts action would prevent him from fulfilling his duties in conclusion the court finds that the interference with the exercise of the second applicants right to freedom of expression was necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention in order to protect the reputation and rights of the f company there has therefore been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the application of the first applicant organisation inadmissible and the remainder of the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention in respect of the second applicant done in english and notified in writing on february pursuant to rule and of the rules of court fatoş aracıandrás sajódeputy registrar president,,,
41,background to the case the applicant was born in and lives in weinheim he is a campaigner against abortion and operates an antiabortion website in december there was an ongoing public debate on developments in human embryonic stemcell research as part of the debate the catholic bishop f voiced criticism of human embryonic stemcell research and a group of scientists at the university of bonn responded to that criticism on december bishop f issued a press release repudiating allegations that his earlier comments had implied a degree of similarity between the scientists carrying out embryonic stemcell research and the nazis who had performed experiments on humans he emphasised that he had had absolutely no intention of casting such defamatory aspersions upon the scientists but reasserted his belief that there was an urgent need for such vitally important ethical issues to be debated critically he claimed that he had never wished to imply that there had been any link between stemcell research and the ideological and historical context of the crimes committed by the dehumanising nazi system which should not be relativised through comparison on december the applicant issued a press release for his initiative never again nie wieder e v with the title dogs which have been hit bark stemcell research in germany getroffene hunde bellen stammzellenforschung in deutschland the press release was published on the internet and handed out as leaflets it read the initiative never again nie wieder e v and the austrian christian social working group christlich soziale arbeitsgemeinschaft österreichs wish to make known their opposition to the press release issued by the university of bonn on december which bears the signatures of eighteen wellknown professors and in which the professors express their outrage at the comments made by bishop f name abbreviated by the court comparing modernday stemcell research to the experiments on human beings carried out by the nazis the professors appear to have forgotten that these experiments were performed in nazi times by willing doctors and scientists these doctors and scientists who were clearly in bondage to the rogue state and subservient to it also carried out their research solely for the good of the people the research performed during the nazi regime took place at a later stage of human life the presentday research takes place at an earlier stage of human life do the professors want to determine humans right to life on the basis of how useful they are the principle of human dignity does not apply only after a particular phase of growth has been completed and people should not be allowed to experiment at will during this phase the professors can spin it any way they want aggravated murder mord will always be aggravated murder regardless of the stage of life at which the human being is destroyed the fact that others were responsible for performing these contract killings does not provide moral justification for working with this human material the comments made by bishop f name abbreviated by the court which were presumably addressed directly to prof dr b name abbreviated by the court were absolutely accurate prof dr b uses embryos people for research purposes at the university of bonn that were murdered in israel and then sold to germany for significant sums of money during nazi times german scientists performed research experiments on jews and then murdered them nowadays the unborn children of people who follow the religion of moses the jews are murdered and sold to the christian country of germany for research purposes all with the blessing of both israel and germany the comparison drawn by bishop f was entirely justified the crimes against democracy being committed in the here and now must be denounced in the strongest possible terms and brought to peoples attention the time has finally arrived to overcome the spirit of auschwitz b criminal proceedings on november the weinheim district court convicted the applicant of insult and sentenced him to a penalty of thirty daily fines of euros eur each in its judgment the court acknowledged the applicants right to freedom of expression and to impart to others his beliefs that the fusion of an egg and a sperm represented the beginning of human life and that research using imported stem cells from terminated embryos involved the destruction of human life it also emphasised that the applicant had the fundamental liberty to exercise his freedom of expression by imparting his opinion strikingly and pointedly including in the form of abusive criticism addressed at wellknown researchers referred to by name however the court found that when viewed in its entirety the press release had exceeded the permissible bounds of abusive criticism the court based this decision on the fact that the implication that the scientists had been guilty not just of committing murder but of doing so for deeply despicable motives had been a central theme running through the press release and had escalated in the phrase the time has finally arrived to overcome the spirit of auschwitz it concluded that the applicant had intended to imply that the scientists carrying out stemcell research had been prompted by the same criminal sadistic and dehumanising motives as those responsible for performing unimaginably cruel mass experiments on humans such as mengele in auschwitz given prof dr bs position as a doctor and scientist this implication had been severely insulting on march the mannheim regional court rejected the applicants appeal similarly to the district court the regional court acknowledged the applicants right to freedom of expression and that his press release had contributed to a debate of great public interest it further held that the majority of the statements in the press release had been value judgments and that therefore the press release had to be classified as a value judgment and not as a statement of fact nonetheless the court stated that freedom of expression was not granted unconditionally and could be subject to restrictions with a view to protecting inter alia the right to personal honour when examining contributions to a debate of public interest however there had to be a presumption in favour of freedom of speech the regional court further found that the criterion for abusive criticism had not been met criticism which was excessive or even aggressive in nature was not necessarily abusive the relevant criterion was whether the main purpose of the criticism had been to defame an individual rather than to debate the relevant issue the court concluded that this was not applicable in the case at hand since the applicants past behaviour and the content of the press release showed that the focus had been on the issue rather than the individual doctor against whom allegations had been made the court therefore found that the right to freedom of expression had to be balanced with the legally protected personality rights of prof dr b and emphasised that freedom of expression granted equal protection to all statements of opinion regardless of whether they were useful useless correct incorrect emotional rational or even polemical or insulting the regional court took into account that the press release had represented the applicants contribution to the formation of public opinion but believed that referring to prof dr b by name had been equivalent to linking his professional conduct to the atrocities committed by the nazis it concluded that this had represented a serious infringement of his personality rights which had also been unnecessary since the applicant could have contributed to the debate without referring to the professor by name on february the court of appeal rejected an appeal on points of law by the applicant as unfounded and on july the federal constitutional court refused to admit a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant without providing reasons bv r ii relevant domestic law the relevant provision of the german basic law grundgesetz reads in so far as relevant as follows article every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech writing and pictures and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources these rights shall find their limits in the provisions of general laws in provisions for the protection of young persons and in the right to personal honour the relevant provisions of the german criminal code strafgesetzbuch read as follows article insult insult shall be punished with imprisonment for not more than one year or a fine and if the insult is committed by means of violence with imprisonment for not more than two years or a fine the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that his criminal conviction for insult had violated his right to freedom of expression as provided in article of the convention which reads in so far as relevant as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or rights of others the government contested that argument a admissibility the court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions the applicant argued that his press release had contributed to a debate of great public importance and had not aimed at personally attacking prof dr b even though the domestic courts had accepted that the applicant had focussed on the issue and had clarified that he had not used abusive criticism they nonetheless had by misinterpreting the actual statements construed an insult in respect of prof dr b which had exceeded the actual content of his press release the applicant further submitted that the courts had insufficiently taken into account that prof dr b had been part of the public debate and had acted as an unofficial spokesperson of the scientists conducting stemcell research in germany consequently sharper criticism and mentioning him by name had been justified the government accepted that the criminal conviction had interfered with the applicants freedom of expression however they submitted that this interference had had a legal basis in article of the criminal code which had served to protect prof dr bs personality rights and reputation and had been necessary in a democratic society the domestic courts had after analysing the text of the press release reasonably interpreted the statements as an implication that the stemcell research carried out by prof dr b had been equivalent to the human experiments performed by scientists during nazi times after weighing up the interests of the applicant against the rights of prof dr b the courts had ultimately found that priority should be given to protecting the personality rights of prof dr b in the undertaken balancing exercise the courts had taken into account that the applicants press release had been protected by the right to freedom of expression that he had had a right to express insulting criticism and that he had been contributing to a public debate however they had also considered the historical and social context of the comparison the severity of the violation of prof dr bs personality rights and the fact that the applicant could have made an equally important or noteworthy contribution to the debate without referring to the professor in question by name the government argued that the courts had therefore taken adequate account of the applicants right and that the decision had not fallen outside the margin of appreciation as granted by the court to domestic authorities the thirdpartys submissions the thirdparty intervener amcb submitted that the convention granted particular protection to statements that contributed to a public debate moreover since ngos had a similar function to the press in a democratic society as public watchdogs their statements required even further increased protection under article of the convention this held true also for unofficial associations which expressed unpopular or minority opinions article also protected ideas that offend shock or disturb and it was the right of the person who expressed her or his opinion to choose the most efficient way to do so amcb therefore argued that comparisons with the holocaust could be considered legitimate expressions of opinion even when taking the historical and social context into account the courts assessment at the outset the court considers and this is not in dispute between the parties that the criminal conviction interfered with the applicants right to freedom of expression that it was prescribed by law namely article of the criminal code and that it pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others it therefore remains to be determined whether the interferences were necessary in a democratic society the fundamental principles concerning the question of whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the courts caselaw and have recently been summarised as follows see delfi as v estonia gc no june with further referencesi freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society as set forth in article this freedom is subject to exceptions which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article iii the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts the court further reiterates that the right to protection of reputation is protected by article of the convention as part of the right to respect for private life see chauvy and others v france no echr vi pfeifer v austria no november and polanco torres and movilla polanco v spain no september in order for article to come into play however an attack on a persons reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be made in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see a v norway no april axel springer ag v germany gc no february and delfi as cited above when examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interests of the protection of the reputation or rights of others the court may be required to ascertain whether the domestic authorities have struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see hachette filipacchi associés v france no june mgn limited v the united kingdom no january axel springer ag cited above and delfi as cited above in cases that require the right to respect for private life to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression the court considers that the outcome of the application should not in theory vary according to whether it has been lodged with the court under article of the convention or under article indeed as a matter of principle these rights deserve equal respect see von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr the court has already found that regardless of the forcefulness of political struggles it is legitimate to try to ensure a minimum degree of moderation and propriety and that a clear distinction must be made between criticism and insult if the sole intent of a particular form of expression is to insult a person an appropriate sanction would not in principle constitute a violation of article of the convention see genner v austria no january the court has further differentiated between statements of fact and value judgments the classification of a statement as fact or as a valuejudgment is a matter which first and foremost falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities in particular the domestic courts see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no while the existence of facts can be demonstrated the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof however even where a statement amounts to a value judgment there must be a sufficient factual basis to support it failing which it will be excessive see jerusalem v austria no echr ii in addition when the court examined cases concerning value judgments which the domestic courts had found to be of a defamatory character it assessed whether the language used had been of an excessive or dispassionate nature and whether an intention of defaming or stigmatising the opponent had been disclosed see genner cited above turning to the circumstances of the present case the court notes that the mannheim regional court classified the press release in its entirety as a value judgment and will therefore proceed on the assumption that the statements are to be considered value judgments the court observes that the domestic courts understood the text of the press release as implying that the conduct of the scientists carrying out stemcell research and in particular of prof b was seen as equivalent to the atrocities committed by the nazis the applicant challenged this understanding of his press release the court notes however that the applicants press release contained a series of comparisons between modernday stemcell research and experiments carried out on humans during the nazi regime which culminated in the sentence the time has finally arrived to overcome the spirit of auschwitz given these statements the court sees no reason to call into question the domestic courts conclusion that the applicant did indeed directly link the work of the scientists and in particular of prof dr b to the atrocities during nazi times the court further notes that the allegations made by the applicant were particularly serious even if as in the instant case regarded as value judgment such serious and particularly offensive comparisons demand a particularly solid factual basis compare genner cited above while the court accepts that the moral responsibility of scientists was the issue discussed this alone does not provide a solid factual basis for targeting personally prof bs scientific work this all the more so as the comparison used was not only shocking and disturbing but went beyond the limits of any acceptable criticism the court also notes that the domestic courts concluded that the focus of the press release had been on the issue and had sought to contribute to a public debate rather than defaming the individual doctor it accepts this finding but would add that the applicant nonetheless made allegations against the scientists and doctors conducting stemcell research and in particular against prof dr b the court therefore finds that even though the intention behind the applicants press release was not mainly to defame the scientists by naming prof dr b it still had a stigmatising and defaming effect in regard to the seriousness of the personal attack on the scientists and prof dr b the court reiterates that the impact an expression of opinion has on another persons personality rights can not be detached from the historical and social context in which the statement was made see annen v germany no november and hoffer and annen v germany nos and january the comparison of modernday stemcell research to experiments carried out on humans in concentration camps must therefore be seen in the specific context of german history the court has previously accepted that in the light of their historical role and experience states which have experienced the nazi horrors may be regarded as having a special moral responsibility to distance themselves from the mass atrocities perpetrated by the nazis see perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extracts and nix v germany dec no march the court therefore concludes that the attack on prof dr bs reputation was serious and that the historical context is a weighty factor to be taken into account when assessing whether there existed a pressing social need for interfering with the applicants right to freedom of expression compare nix cited above the court also observes that prof dr b and the other scientists had by responding to the criticism voiced by bishop f entered the public debate concerning stemcell research before the publication of the applicants press release and therefore finds that they could not claim the same particular protection as individuals completely unknown to the public notwithstanding the facts that the applicants statements sought to contribute to a public debate and that prof dr b had entered the public stage to a certain degree the court concludes that the domestic courts provided relevant and sufficient reasons for the criminal conviction of the applicant the court recalls that where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see delfi as cited above with further references it finds that the decisions by the domestic courts were based on a reasonable assessment of the statements in question the rights of prof dr b and of the circumstances of the present case lastly the court observes that the sanction was criminal in nature which is in view of the existence of other means of intervention and rebuttal particularly through civil remedies one of the most serious forms of interference with the right to freedom of expression see perinçek cited above and frisk and jensen v denmark no december while the use of criminallaw sanctions in defamation cases is not in itself disproportionate the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are factors to be taken into account because they must not be such as to dissuade the press or others who engage in public debate from taking part in the discussion of matters of legitimate public concern ziembiński v poland no no july with further references in that regard it notes that the applicant was sentenced to a penalty of daily fines of eur each and thereby to a sentence at the lower end of the possible criminal sanctions for insult having regard to the seriousness of the violations of prof dr bs personality rights and the nature of the personalized attacks when seen in the historical context see paragraph above the court finds that the penalty appears moderate and did not fall outside of the domestic courts margin of appreciation there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the complaint concerning article of the convention admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on

42,application no the first applicant is a nongovernmental organisation established with the aim of conducting journalistic investigations into matters of public interest the second applicant is a journalist and one of its founding members on an unspecified date in the second applicant acting on behalf of the first applicant asked the registry of the khashuri district court to give her access to a case file concerning an unrelated criminal case brought against a certain te and in which he had been convicted she did not give any reasons for her request and briefly indicated that she intended to photocopy and photograph the criminal case material stored in the archives of the court registry by a decision of august the court registry stated that the second applicants request could not be granted in its current form more specifically it invited her to specify exactly which information andor documents she wished to consult and for what purpose stating that it would review its decision upon receipt of the requested information the registry advised the second applicant that the criminal case file in question contained certain classified investigative information public disclosure of which was strictly prohibited section and of the special investigative activities act of april it further advised her that the criminal case file contained personal data about te as well as other parties to the criminal proceedings in question and that public disclosure of that information was only possible with their explicit consent article of the general administrative code the second applicant never provided the further clarification sought by the court registry instead on september she lodged a court action concerning the registrys decision of august requesting its annulment as confirmed by a statement of claim dated september filed with the borjomi district court the second applicant acting on behalf of the first applicant did not explain the purpose of her request to access the criminal case file in question she merely claimed that the registrys decision of august had restricted her right of access to information of public interest which was enshrined in article of the general administrative code according to the transcript of a hearing before the borjomi district court on december attended by both parties the second applicant briefly mentioned that she needed to obtain access to the criminal case file for the purposes of a journalistic investigation project however she did not give any details about the project in question and relied exclusively on the general argument that her right of access to public information should not be limited she further provided extensive legal arguments as to why the respondents interpretation of the relevant provisions of the special investigative activities act and the general administrative code had been erroneous by a judgment of december the borjomi district court dismissed the second applicants action as illfounded it confirmed that the respondents decision to withhold the criminal case material from the second applicant had been legitimate and based on a correct interpretation of section and of the special investigative activities act and article of the general administrative code on january the second applicant appealed against the judgment of december complaining that the firstinstance court had incorrectly interpreted the relevant provisions of domestic law in her statement of appeal she focused exclusively on her right to have unfettered access to public information without giving any details as to why she had sought access to the criminal case material according to the transcript of a hearing before the tbilisi court of appeal on june attended by both parties the second applicant stated i as a journalist no longer need access to the criminal case material because the journalistic investigation has already been terminated and its results have already been published however she emphasised that what was important for her was the creation a legal precedent that would acknowledge the significance of the right to have unfettered access to information of public interest she considered that a criminal case file was public information within the meaning of article of the general administrative code and that anyone was entitled to have access to it by a judgment of june the tbilisi court of appeal dismissed the second applicants appeal as illfounded and upheld the judgment of the lower court on february the supreme court rejected an appeal on points of law lodged by the second applicant as inadmissible terminating the proceedings b application no the third applicant was a practising lawyer in georgia on march he was convicted of fraud for stealing money entrusted to him by a client for the purpose of securing bail in criminal proceedings he was sentenced to three years and six months in prison for further details see nozadze v georgia dec committee no may on october the third applicant while still in prison asked the registry of tbilisi city court to send him a copy of all the court orders concerning the imposition of pretrial preventive measures in six distinct and unrelated criminal cases he did not specify why he was interested in that particular information on october the registry of tbilisi city court sent the third applicant a copy of the operative parts of the relevant court orders stating that in accordance with article of the code of criminal procedure as in force at the material time only the operative parts of detention orders could be disclosed on november the third applicant brought a court action against the registry of the tbilisi city court complaining that its refusal to provide him with a full copy of the relevant court orders had infringed his right under article of the general administrative code to have unfettered access to public information by a judgment of december the tbilisi court of appeal dismissed the applicants action as illfounded the court stated that the relevant chapter of the general administrative code and more specifically article thereof which provided for the right to receive public information from the state and regulated the procedure for the exercise of that right did not apply pursuant to article and of the same code to the judiciary within the framework of the administration of justice in that connection the court attached significance to the fact that all six of the criminal cases about which the third applicant had tried to obtain information were still ongoing at that time on july the supreme court of georgia sitting in camera rejected an appeal on points of law lodged by the third applicant terminating the proceedings a copy of the final decision was served on the third applicant on october ii relevant domestic law and practicea special investigative activities act of april the relevant provisions of the special investigative activities act კანონი ოპერატიულსამძებრო საქმიანობის შესახებ as in force at the material time provided as follows section special investigative activities special investigative activities are a form of overt or covert activity carried out by special divisions of state agencies authorised by this act hereinafter special investigative agencies within the scope of their powers with a view to protecting the rights and freedoms of individuals and legal entities and public security against criminal offences and other types of wrongdoing section special investigative activities and public disclosure special investigative activities are strictly classified all documents data and sources of information relating to such activities shall be accessible only to people possessing special qualifications who are authorised to do so by the present act the public disclosure of documents or other material relating to special investigative activities shall result in criminal prosecution for disclosure of state secrets b general administrative code of june under article of the general administrative code not all types of information collected and stored by a public authority are considered to be public information more specifically under article m information collected or stored by a public authority is considered classified if it contains either personal data about third parties or relates to a commercial or state secret under article and only chapter iii of the code is to apply with respect to the judiciary and only in connection with purely administrative or organisational functions article further specifies that the whole of the code does not apply to bodies of the executive branch of state power concerned with conducting criminal investigations and prosecutions articles and of the code further specify that everyone has a right to obtain access to public information stored by a public authority unless this information relates to a state professional or commercial secret or contains personal data about third parties chapter iii of the code of which article forms part is dedicated to governing the procedure for the exercise of the right of access to public information the relevant part of that provision reads as follows article request to access public information everybody has the right to access public information regardless of the form in which it has been stored an application to access public information shall be submitted in writing if such an application may result in the disclosure of classified information it shall be accompanied by a certified consent from the third party concerned the lawi joinder of the applications having regard to the similar subject matter of the applications the court finds it appropriate to examine them jointly in a single judgment in accordance with rule of the rules of court ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicants complained that the domestic judicial authorities had denied them access to information of general public interest they relied on article of the convention the relevant parts of which read as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the government objected that application no should be rejected as inadmissible under article b of the convention as the first and second applicants had not suffered a significant disadvantage in connection with their complaints under article of the convention thus even in the absence of access to the relevant court decisions the two applicants had been able to conduct their journalistic investigation and publish its results see paragraph above the government did not make any objection to the admissibility of application no the first and second applicants disagreed with the governments objection relating to the admissibility of their complaints under article of the convention reiterating that the subject matter of the application was not whether or not they had been able to conduct their journalistic investigation but rather the matter of principle that they had been unlawfully denied access to information of public interest while the government have not raised an objection as regards the applicability of article of the convention the court considers that it has to address this issue of its own motion it recalls in this connection that questions relating to the applicability of article and the existence of interferences the latter forming part of the merits of the relevant complaints are often inextricably linked see magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no and november and also as regards the applicability of article of the convention see denisov v ukraine gc no september as it has previously explained in the latter case concerning article since the question of applicability is an issue of the courts jurisdiction ratione materiae as a general rule the relevant analysis should be carried out at the admissibility stage unless there is a particular reason to join this question to the merits ibid in the present case the court considers that the significance of the fact that the first and second applicants were able to finalise their journalistic investigation for the purposes of which they had requested access to certain court decisions is closely linked with the question of whether there has been an interference with their rights under article of the convention more importantly the present case raises a novel issue at domestic level and is one of the first cases following the judgment of the grand chamber in magyar helsinki bizottság to test the limits to the right of access to information recognized in that judgment in certain circumstances and the applicability of article of the convention in that regard accordingly the court decides to join the governments objection to the merits of application no furthermore it decides to examine the question of applicability of article of the convention together with that pertaining to the existence of interference under this provision on the merits of the present cases that decision however does not detract from the general rule referenced above according to which issues relating to the applicability of article will normally fall to be examined in most cases at the admissibility stage the court further observes that all three applicants complaints under article of the convention are neither manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention nor inadmissible on any other grounds these complaints must therefore be declared admissible b merits the applicants submissions the first and second applicants application no relying on the relevant criteria developed by the court in its judgment of magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no november first argued that their inability to have access to the relevant court decisions had constituted an interference with the exercise of their right to freedom of expression they explained that they had sought access to the criminal case material because they believed that the person who had come forward as the victim in those criminal proceedings had in actual fact been an agent provocateur and they had at the material time been working on a documentary exposing police misconduct acknowledging the fact that they had been able to finalise their journalistic investigation even in the absence of the solicited information see paragraph above and paragraph below the two applicants argued that the disclosure of that information would have allowed them to deliver an even better journalistic product the first and second applicants argued that the relevant judicial authoritys refusal to grant them access to information of interest to them had been unlawful because the criminal case material had related not to an ongoing criminal case but one which had already been terminated they claimed that since the special investigative activities act did not apply to closed criminal cases section should not have been relied on as the legal basis for withholding public information from them the two applicants further argued that the interference with their right to receive information had not pursued any legitimate aim and had been disproportionate thus with respect to those elements the applicants argued among other things that since the criminal case material had already been examined openly and publicly in court its nondisclosure could not possibly serve the interests of protecting either a state secret or personal data about the parties to the proceedings the third applicant no although not referring directly to the principles laid down in the case of magyar helsinki bizottság cited above in substance provided arguments in line with the first two applicants submissions he stated that he had not deemed it necessary to indicate to the domestic judicial authority the purpose of his request for access to the relevant court decisions because it was his understanding that the right enshrined in article of the general administrative code meant that public authorities were under an absolute obligation to divulge information held in their possession he further stated that since all six of the criminal cases about which he had requested information had been directed against former highranking state officials who had all been wellknown public figures prosecuted for various corruption offences the public had had the right to know all the details about those highprofile criminal proceedings the third applicant further claimed that generally speaking full access to decisions issued by domestic courts promoted the general principles of transparency and accountability lastly he claimed in line with the first and second applicants submissions that the interference with his right to receive information under article of the convection had been unlawful and disproportionate the governments arguments as regards application no the government submitted that there had not been an interference with the first and second applicants right to receive information as even in the absence of access to the court decisions of interest to them they had been able to finalise their journalistic investigation and had published its results in the form of a video uploaded onto the first applicants official you tube channel referring the court to the web address of the video in question the government noted that it had already had more than thirtyseven thousand views which could be taken as proof that the applicants had been successful in their investigation and that consequently there could be no room for suspecting that the state had interfered with their freedom of expression furthermore the government emphasised that the reply of the khashuri district courts registry had not been absolute but conditional the judicial authority had simply asked the applicants to provide further clarification upon receipt of which it would review its position concerning the public disclosure of the relevant documents alternatively assuming that there had been an interference with the first and second applicants rights under article of the convention the government submitted extensive arguments to show by reference to various examples of relevant domestic legal practice that the interference had been lawful and had pursued in a proportionate manner the legitimate aim of protecting from public disclosure information classified as state secrets and personal data with respect to application no the government submitted that the third applicant had requested access to the court decision in his capacity as an ordinary citizen he was neither a journalist nor associated with any other social watchdog and hence his freedomofexpression rights had been more prone to restriction the third applicant could not be said to have requested access to the relevant information in order to contribute to an informed public debate assuming that there had been an interference with the third applicants right to freedom of expression the government submitted extensive arguments to show that it had been lawful and proportionate the courts assessmenta general principles regarding the applicability of article and the existence of interference the court reiterates that article of the convention does not confer on the individual a right of access to information held by a public authority nor oblige the government to impart such information to the individual however such a right or obligation may arise firstly where disclosure of the information has been imposed by a judicial order which has gained legal force and secondly in circumstances where access to the information is instrumental for the individuals exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression whether and to what extent the denial of access to information constitutes an interference with an applicants freedomofexpression rights must be assessed in each individual case and in the light of its particular circumstances see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above in order to determine whether article can be said to apply to a public authoritys refusal to disclose information the situation must be assessed in the light of the following criteria a the purpose of the information request b the nature of the information sought c the particular role of the seeker of the information in receiving and imparting it to the public and d whether the information was ready and available ibid b application of these principles to the circumstances of the present case turning to the circumstances of application no the court notes that whilst the journalistic role of the first and second applicants was undeniably compatible with the scope of the right to solicit access to stateheld information compare for instance roşiianu v romania no june the purpose of their information request can not be said to have satisfied the relevant criterion under article of the convention see the preceding paragraph in fine this is because they failed to specify in the relevant domestic proceedings the purpose of their request for permission to consult the criminal case file they never explained to the relevant court registry why the documents were necessary for the exercise of their freedom to receive and impart information to others see paragraph above and contrast cangı v turkey no january noting that omission the domestic authority explicitly invited the applicants to address that gap by clarifying the purpose of their request what is more the authority expressed its readiness to reconsider its initial refusal upon receipt of the requisite information from the applicants the latter however ignored that opportunity and instead decided to sue the authority for breaching their alleged right to have unrestricted access to stateheld information of public interest see paragraphs and above and compare sioutis v greece dec no august and also mutatis mutandis bubon v russia no february however it should be restated in this connection that article of the convention does not confer on individuals an absolute right to access stateheld information see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above the court further observes that even in the absence of the information sought the first and second applicants were able to proceed with their journalistic investigation thus even without waiting for the outcome of the relevant proceedings which they themselves had initiated against the domestic judicial authority they finalised the investigation and made its results accessible to the public see paragraphs and above in other words it can be inferred from the particular circumstances of the case at hand that the access sought by the first and second applicants to the relevant criminal case material was not instrumental for the effective exercise of their freedomofexpression rights see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above and contrast cangı cited above indeed the second applicant acknowledged herself before the domestic court that she as a journalist had not needed the information for the purposes of her journalistic activities and that it had been merely a matter of principle for her to obtain judicial acknowledgement of what she considered to be her unfettered right to have access to stateheld public information see again paragraph above as regards the first and second applicants argument regarding the correlation between the disclosure of the information of interest to them and the quality of their ultimate journalistic product see paragraph above the court observes that they have never voiced any similar argument before the domestic courts as regards application no it should be noted that the third applicant like the first and second applicants did not take the trouble to explain to the relevant court registry the purpose of his request to obtain a full copy of the relevant court decisions see paragraph above which makes it impossible for the court to accept that the information sought was instrumental for the exercise of his freedomofexpression rights contrast cangı cited above and most importantly it is unclear how the third applicants role in society was supposed to satisfy the relevant criterion under article of the convention thus the court observes that the third applicant was neither a journalist nor a representative of a public watchdog ibid he did not clarify in the proceedings before the court how he could enhance by receiving a copy of detention orders in six criminal cases totally unrelated to him the publics access to news or facilitate the dissemination of information in the interest of public governance compare magyar helsinki bizottság cited above and sioutis cited above nor is the court persuaded that the information solicited from the domestic judicial authority by the third applicant met the relevant publicinterest test under article of the convention see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above while acknowledging the significance of the principle that court decisions are to be pronounced publicly and should be in some form made accessible to the public in the interest of the good administration of justice and transparency see for instance fazliyski v bulgaria no april the court restates that the requirement that the information sought meet a publicinterest test in order to prompt a need for disclosure under article of the convention is different as it refers to the specific subjectmatter of the document in this case of the judicial orders compare sioutis the decision cited above and österreichische vereinigung zur erhaltung stärkung und schaffung v austria no and november in that connection that is as regards the question of whether or not the specific subjectmatter of the solicited documents involved publicinterest considerations the applicant limited his arguments to mentioning that the solicited judicial decisions concerned highprofile criminal cases instituted against former highranking state officials for corruption offences see paragraph above however the court considers that the fact that the accused in those cases were wellknown public figures was not in itself sufficient to justify under article disclosure of a full copy of the relevant judicial orders concerning the ongoing criminal proceedings including the parts which did not constitute public information according to the domestic law applicable at the material time see paragraphs and above to a third party acting in a purely private capacity compare mutatis mutandis with sioutis the decision cited above and indeed the public interest is hardly the same as an audiences curiosity compare mutatis mutandis magyar helsinki bizottság cited above the foregoing considerations concerning the questions of applicability of article of the convention and the existence of interference under this provision are sufficient to enable the court to conclude that there has been no violation of the said article with respect to either of the two applications at hand accordingly there is no need to rule on the governments objection regarding the lack of significant disadvantage in relation to application no iii other alleged violations of the convention lastly as regards application no the third applicant complained under article of the convention about the length of the relevant domestic proceedings the court having regard to the fact that the domestic proceedings lasted approximately two years and three months overall at three levels of jurisdiction finds that the complaint is manifestly illfounded and must be rejected in accordance with article a and of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously decides to join the applications joins to the merits the governments objection regarding the lack of significant disadvantage as regards application no decides to examine on the merits the questions of applicability of article of the convention and the existence of interference with the applicants rights under this provision declares the applicants complaints under article of the convention admissible and the remainder of application no inadmissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention decides that there is no need to rule on the governments objection regarding the lack of significant disadvantage in relation to

43,in and lives in kassel he was represented by mr b hopmann a lawyer practising in berlin the government were represented by ms g marok wachter director of the office of justice of the principality of liechtenstein the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows the events leading to the applicants dismissal the applicant is a doctor specialised in general and internal medicine from june he was employed as deputy chief physician of the department for internal medicine at the liechtenstein national hospital liechtensteinisches landesspital a registered liechtenstein public law foundation he worked under a contract of indefinite duration which could be terminated with six months notice his direct superior was dr h chief physician of the said department on september the applicant did some research in the electronic medical files of the hospital he found information showing that four patients had died in the hospital following the administration of morphine he concluded from notes made in these files that dr h who had treated these patients had practised active euthanasia on the same day the applicant met with the president of the control committee of the liechtenstein parliament the parliamentary control committee mr m on the latters initiative following several anonymous complaints about deficiencies in quality in the liechtenstein national hospital on that occasion the applicant voiced suspicions that dr h had practised active euthanasia on september the applicant on mr ms advice lodged a criminal complaint against dr h with the public prosecutors office which instituted proceedings against dr h on suspicion inter alia of killing on request and participation in another persons suicide on september the police seized the paper medical files of the four patients concerned at the liechtenstein national hospital and questioned dr h on september the applicant following further research in the hospitals electronic medical files informed the public prosecutors office that he suspected that dr h had practised active euthanasia on six additional patients he was questioned by the police on the same day he supported his suspicions by the fact that according to the electronic files the death of these patients had occurred shortly after the start of the treatment with morphine that morphine had been given even without an indication that the patients suffered from pain that the treatment had been called supportive therapy or supportive measures and having regard to the medication administered he stressed that the aim of his statement was to avert damage to patients of the hospital at the time of the events the liechtenstein national hospital had a body to which irregularities could be reported anonymously via an online form the critical incident reporting system cirs while initially dr h alone had been the person examining and acting upon such reports this task had been entrusted to a group of three persons not including dr h since summer at the latest it is unclear when this change in responsibilities was communicated within the hospital the applicant did not contact this body on and september the vicepresident of the hospitals foundation board drew up three reports on the request of the foundation board regarding the treatment of the ten patients in question having examined the patients paper files and having questioned dr h he concluded that all patients had been in a palliative situation under the whos standards and that there had not been any mistake regarding the morphine administered he considered that the applicant had failed to take into account the pain or difficulty in breathing of the patients concerned which had made necessary the treatment in question if the applicant had read the patients paper files which alone as had been known at the time had contained complete information regarding the patients condition and treatment and to which he had had access he would have realised immediately that his suspicions of active euthanasia were clearly unfounded on september the applicant was suspended from office on october the applicant made a written statement setting out his position to the national hospital on the latters request he explained that he had done some research in the electronic files of several patients who had died in the past weeks following an indication by a doctor working in the hospital that recently there had been an unusual rise in deaths of patients in the hospital in his view the ten patients concerned had clearly not been treated lege artis after thorough reflection he had decided to inform the public prosecutors office in order to protect the patients and the hospital and to comply with his own ethical convictions and the provisions of the physicians act ärztegesetz see paragraph below as he was convinced that there had been criminal offences as he had not expected the matter to be investigated properly within the hospital and in view of the urgency of the situation he had not contacted an internal body of the hospital prior to lodging a criminal complaint with the public prosecutors office in a report received by the national hospital on october a swiss external medical expert in palliative medicine commissioned by the hospital n having studied the medical paper files of the patients concerned and having heard dr h concluded that no active euthanasia had been practised on the ten patients in question the expert considered that the patients palliative treatment had been necessary and justified as they had been at the end of their lives they had died as a result of their illnesses and not as a result of their treatment they had been given morphine in order to treat their pain and difficulty in breathing and not to end their lives the expert noted that some of the morphine doses prescribed especially those without upper limit may not have been necessary but such doses had never been administered in practice on october the director of the national hospital dismissed the applicant without notice he considered that owing to the applicants severe fault the relationship of trust with him had been destroyed irretrievably he argued that the applicant had failed to raise his allegations of active euthanasia and quality flaws with the hospitals competent internal bodies prior to raising them externally with the president of the parliamentary control committee and with the public prosecutors office the applicant had been obliged to inform dr h or at least the director of the hospital or a member of the foundation board with whom he had a normal relationship of his allegations furthermore the applicants allegations of euthanasia had been considered as clearly unfounded by the external expert commissioned by the hospital the liechtenstein newspapers and radio repeatedly reported on the suspicions of active euthanasia at the liechtenstein national hospital and the criminal investigations against dr h in this respect the outcome of the criminal investigation proceedings against dr h and against the applicant the investigating judge in the criminal proceedings against dr h had also commissioned an external expert practising in austria l in his report dated october received by the investigating judge on december the expert having regard to the medical paper files of the patients in question came to the conclusion that dr h had not practised active euthanasia the patients had been given morphine only as necessitated by their palliative situation and this treatment had not caused the patients death doubts regarding such palliative medical treatment and ethical decisions taken in that context could be excluded by a better documentation of the treatment in the future on december the criminal proceedings against dr h were discontinued on december criminal proceedings instituted against the applicant for having deliberately cast wrong suspicions of a criminal offence on another person by his allegations that dr h had practised active euthanasia were equally discontinued the proceedings before the domestic courts proceedings before the regional court on november the applicant brought an action against the liechtenstein national hospital for payment of some swiss francs chf in compensation for the loss of salary and further pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage he claimed that his dismissal without notice had been unlawful there had been no important reason for his dismissal as lodging a criminal complaint against dr h had been justified in view of the concrete suspicions of active euthanasia and the gravity of the offence concerned on august the regional court dismissed the applicants action it found that the applicants dismissal without notice had been justified under article a and of the civil code see paragraph below the court considered in essence that there had been an important reason for the employing hospital to terminate the employment contract as the applicant had failed to sufficiently verify his unfounded suspicions of active euthanasia in the patients medical paper files and to signal his suspicions within the hospital prior to informing external bodies thereof the continuation of the employment relationship by the hospital could no longer be expected in good faith proceedings before the court of appeal on january the court of appeal allowing an appeal lodged by the applicant quashed the regional courts judgment it ordered the defendant hospital to pay the applicant chf in salary arrears and remitted the remainder of the case to the regional court for a fresh consideration of the applicants compensation claims the court of appeal found that the applicants dismissal without notice had not been justified the disclosure of irregularities to third persons was covered by the right to freedom of expression and could justify a dismissal only if it was coupled with a serious breach of the duty of loyalty however there was no such serious breach in the present case the court of appeal argued that the institution of proceedings against dr h by the public prosecutors office confirmed that the applicants suspicions had not been unfounded in view of the severity of the offence at issue contacting external bodies such as the parliamentary control committee or the public prosecutors office which were both under a duty of confidentiality had not been disproportionate the fact that the applicant had reported directly to the public prosecutors office did not raise an issue in this respect the court further agreed with the applicant that in the circumstances of the case reporting the issue to dr h in the context of the internal mechanism to report irregularities had not been a suitable approach proceedings before the supreme court on may the supreme court allowing the defendant hospitals appeal on points of law quashed the court of appeals judgment it dismissed the applicants claim for payment of chf in salary arrears in a partial judgment and remitted the remainder of the case to the court of appeal in a partial decision for it to dismiss the applicants action in that regard the supreme court considered that the applicants dismissal without notice had been lawful it stressed that the applicant a senior employee had only consulted the electronic medical files which he had known to be incomplete although he could have consulted the paper files at any moment if he had done so he would have recognised immediately that his suspicions were clearly unfounded he had thus failed to verify his serious and unjustified allegations before disclosing them to third persons and before lodging a criminal complaint this conduct amounted to a serious breach of trust in relation to his employer which justified his dismissal without notice proceedings before the constitutional court on june the applicant lodged a complaint with the constitutional court against the partial judgment and partial decision of the supreme court he argued that his dismissal had breached in particular his right to freedom of expression under the constitution and article of the convention reporting his suspicions of active euthanasia to external bodies had been justified whistleblowing on september the constitutional court found that the applicants constitutional complaint was admissible as the supreme court had taken a final stance on the applicants action but dismissed the complaint on the merits file no st gh the right to freedom of expression applied in the relationship between the applicant and the liechtenstein national hospital while the hospital was a state institution the applicants dismissal was not an act of public authority but was governed by private law the right to freedom of expression nevertheless applied indirectly in their relationship indirekte drittwirkung the constitutional court accepted that the applicant regarded himself as a whistleblower having regard to the criteria developed inter alia by the european court of human rights in the case of heinisch v germany no echr extracts on freedom of expression in the context of whistleblowing the constitutional court found that the applicants right to freedom of expression had not been violated by his dismissal without notice it recognised that there was a considerable public interest in medical treatment which was in accordance with the state of the art in a public hospital moreover the civil courts had not found that the applicant had acted out of personal motives the constitutional court noted however that the applicant had failed to test his suspicions regarding the practice of active euthanasia arising from the electronic medical files by verifying the paper files of the patients concerned had he done so he would have realised immediately that his suspicions which could be considered comprehensible having regard to the electronic files alone were clearly unfounded in the light of the gravity of the allegations and the consequences for all concerned by them in the event that these allegations became public the applicant had been obliged to proceed to such verification even more as he had known that the electronic files had been incomplete the applicant had therefore acted irresponsibly therefore his right to freedom of expression had not been breached the constitutional court just as the supreme court could thus leave open whether the applicant prior to raising his allegations externally should have attempted to raise them internally notably with the director of the hospital the judgment was served on the applicants counsel on november relevant legal framework and practicerelevant domestic law provisions of the civil code article a of the civil code allgemeines bürgerliches gesetzbuch lays down rules on employment contracts paragraph of that article in so far as relevant provides the employee must carry out the work entrusted to him diligently and must respect the employers legitimate interests loyally article a of the civil code contains rules on the termination of employment contracts without notice for important reasons in so far as relevant it provides for important reasons both the employer and the employee may terminate an employment relationship at any time without notice an important reason exists in particular where in the circumstances a continuation of the employment relationship can not be expected any longer in good faith from the party terminating the relationship provision of the physicians act the physicians act ärztegesetz of october lays down rules on physicians exercise of their profession article of that act on notification duties in so far as relevant provides physicians are obliged to notify the office of public health amt für gesundheit or directly the public health service amtsärztlicher dienst of findings made in the exercise of their profession which give rise to suspicions that a criminal offence resulted in a persons death or serious bodily injury relevant international law and practice resolution of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on the protection of whistleblowers in its resolution on the protection of whistleblowers adopted on april the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe pace stressed the importance of whistleblowing concerned individuals sounding an alarm in order to stop wrongdoings that place fellow human beings at risk notably as an opportunity to strengthen accountability in both the public and private sectors see point of the resolution it invited all member states to review their legislation concerning the protection of whistleblowers keeping in mind the following guiding principles the definition of protected disclosures shall include all bona fide warnings against various types of unlawful acts including all serious human rights violations which affect or threaten the life health liberty and any other legitimate interests of individuals as subjects of public administration or taxpayers or as shareholders employees or customers of private companies the legislation should therefore cover both public and private sector whistleblowers and it should codify relevant issues in the following areas of law employment law in particular protection against unfair dismissals and other forms of employmentrelated retaliation this legislation should protect anyone who in good faith makes use of existing internal whistleblowing channels from any form of retaliation unfair dismissal harassment or any other punitive or discriminatory treatment where internal channels either do not exist have not functioned properly or could reasonably be expected not to function properly given the nature of the problem raised by the whistleblower external whistleblowing including through the media should likewise be protected any whistleblower shall be considered as having acted in good faith provided he or she had reasonable grounds to believe that the information disclosed was true even if it later turns out that this was not the case and provided he or she did not pursue any unlawful or unethical objectives the above guidelines were also referred to in the parliamentary assemblys related recommendation adopted on the same day recommending inter alia that the committee of ministers draw up a set of guidelines for the protection of whistleblowers point recommendation cmrec of the committee of ministers of the council of europe on the protection of whistleblowers on april at the th meeting of the ministers deputies the committee of ministers of the council of europe adopted recommendation cmrec to member states on the protection of whistleblowers the committee of ministers took note in particular of resolution of the parliamentary assembly see paragraph above it recommended that member states have in place a normative institutional and judicial framework to protect individuals who in the context of their workbased relationship report or disclose information on threats or harm to the public interest the appendix to the recommendation sets out a series of principles to guide member states in the protection of such whistleblowers the appendix to recommendation cmrec provides in particular iv channels for reporting and disclosures clear channels should be put in place for public interest reporting and disclosures and recourse to them should be facilitated through appropriate measures the channels for reporting and disclosures comprise reports within an organisation or enterprise including to persons designated to receive reports in confidence reports to relevant public regulatory bodies law enforcement agencies and supervisory bodies disclosures to the public for example to a journalist or a member of parliament the individual circumstances of each case will determine the most appropriate channel vii protection against retaliation whistleblowers should be protected against retaliation of any form whether directly or indirectly by their employer and by persons working for or acting on behalf of the employer forms of such retaliation might include dismissal suspension demotion loss of promotion opportunities punitive transfers and reductions in or deductions of wages harassment or other punitive or discriminatory treatment protection should not be lost solely on the basis that the individual making the report or disclosure was mistaken as to its import or that the perceived threat to the public interest has not materialised provided he or she had reasonable grounds to believe in its accuracy where an employer has put in place an internal reporting system and the whistleblower has made a disclosure to the public without resorting to the system this may be taken into consideration when deciding on the remedies or level of protection to afford to the whistleblower further council of europe texts and other international instruments the parliamentary assembly recalled its resolution in subsequent texts on whistleblowing notably in resolution and recommendation on improving the protection of whistleblowers both adopted by the parliamentary assembly on june and in resolution and recommendation on improving the protection of whistleblowers all over europe both adopted on october further council of europe and other international instruments relevant in this field are referred to in heinisch cited above the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that his dismissal without notice from the national hospital on account of the fact that he had lodged a criminal complaint for active euthanasia had breached his right to freedom of expression as provided in article of the convention which in so far as relevant reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that view admissibility the court notes that the application is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merits whether there was an interference in the applicants submission his dismissal without notice after he had raised suspicions externally that active euthanasia had been practised in the national hospital constituted an interference with his right to freedom of expression under article of the convention the government agreed that the dismissal had interfered with article the court reiterates that the protection of article extends to the workplace in general see heinisch v germany no echr extracts with further references matúz v hungary no october and langner v germany no september in cases concerning freedom of expression of employees in stateowned or statecontrolled companies or bodies it recalled that article applied not only to employment relationships governed by public law but also to those under private law in addition in certain cases the state had a positive obligation to protect the right to freedom of expression even in the sphere of relations between individuals see fuentes bobo v spain no february heinisch cited above and matúz cited above the court notes that on account of his statements regarding active euthanasia the applicant was dismissed as a physician by the liechtenstein national hospital a public law foundation his employment relationship was governed by private law the dismissal was subsequently endorsed in particular by the liechtenstein constitutional court the court considers that in these circumstances the measure in question constituted an interference by a state authority with the applicants right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the convention compare also fuentes bobo cited above heinisch cited above and matúz cited above in all of which the dismissal of an employee in a stateowned or controlled company whose employment relationship was governed by private law was addressed from the standpoint of an interference with the respective employees rights whether the interference was justified such interference will constitute a breach of article unless it is prescribed by law pursues a legitimate aim under its paragraph and is necessary in a democratic society for the achievement of such aima interference prescribed by law the court observes that the applicants dismissal was based on article a of the civil code see paragraphs and above which authorises the termination of employment contracts without notice for important reasons it was thus prescribed by law for the purposes of article this is indeed uncontested by the partiesb legitimate aim the court notes that there was no dispute between the parties and the court agrees that the interference pursued the legitimate aims of protecting the reputation and rights of others it served to protect both the business reputation and interests of the employing national hospital including its interest in a professional work relationship based on mutual trust and the reputation of the hospitals chief physician who was concerned by the applicants allegations of euthanasia compare also steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii heinisch cited above and langner cited above c necessity of the interference in a democratic societyi the parties submissionsα the applicant in the applicants submission his dismissal without notice had been disproportionate and thus not justified he stressed first that the information given by him to the public prosecutors office regarding suspicions of active euthanasia on seriously ill and defenceless patients had undoubtedly been of considerable public interest the applicant further took the view that he had verified sufficiently that the information he disclosed was accurate and reliable he contested in particular that it would clearly have resulted from the paper version of the medical files of the patients concerned that his suspicions had been unfounded both the hospital and the investigating judge considered it necessary to consult an external expert on the question of whether there had been active euthanasia and one of the experts had found that there had been an insufficient documentation of the treatment in these files moreover his employer would have noticed research in the paper files the public interest in a democratic society to be informed of potential irregularities in the treatment in a public hospital outweighed the hospitals business interests the allegations contained in the criminal complaint lodged by him with the public prosecutors office had been detrimental to the national hospital but it had been the hospital itself which had informed the media and public thereof moreover the applicant argued that there had not been any effective internal channels for making the disclosure he had not been obliged to report his suspicions to his superior dr h who was directly concerned by them as this would have resulted in his immediate dismissal the director of the hospital was part of the hospitals management together with dr h the hospitals foundation board for its part had not been responsible for employees complaints of this kind likewise he had not been obliged to turn to the hospitals internal complaint mechanism cirs as he had not been informed that at the relevant time it was no longer dr h himself who was responsible for dealing with the complaints received therefore the only way to ensure effective investigations in the present case had been to contact an external body the public prosecutors office which had been independent of internal personal links and just like the parliamentary control committee under a duty of confidentiality moreover owing to the gravity of the suspicions the fact that several patients had died shortly after the start of their morphine treatment and his position of deputy head of department potentially exposing him to criminal liability himself it had been urgent to act the applicant stressed that he had been fully convinced that having regard to the information contained in the electronic files which he considered to contain sufficient information that there had been active euthanasia he had therefore disclosed the information in good faith the applicant finally submitted that his dismissal without notice being the harshest sanction under labour law had also had the consequence that he had had to leave liechtenstein with his family as he was to lose his residence permit as a result furthermore he had had serious difficulties in finding new employment afterwards this had a chilling effect on other hospital employees discouraging them from disclosing irregularitiesβ the government in the governments view the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression had been justified as it had been necessary to protect the reputation and the rights of the employing hospital and of the accused chief physician the government accepted that there was in principle an interest of the hospitals patients in the protection of their life and limb and also generally a public interest in information on whether the treatment in a public hospital was in accordance with the rules of the medical profession however it had to be taken into account in the present case that the applicants allegations had been frivolous and unfounded the government further submitted that as had been confirmed by the domestic courts the applicant had failed to verify in the paper medical files of the patients concerned that the information he had disclosed on the basis of elements discovered in the electronic files which he knew to be incomplete was accurate and reliable the applicant had been able to do so at any time and would then have realised that his suspicions of active euthanasia were unfounded the public interest in having the information in question revealed did not outweigh the interest of the applicants employer and of the chief physician concerned in the protection of their business and personal reputation damaged as a result of the applicants serious and unjustified allegations several effective alternative channels for making the disclosure obtaining an internal clarification of the allegations rapidly and remedying the alleged wrongdoing would have been available to the applicant he could have informed the director or a member of the foundation board of the hospital as had been demonstrated by the investigations done following the disclosure of the allegations by the applicant there was nothing to indicate that they would not have investigated the allegations properly alternatively the applicant could have complained anonymously via the hospitals critical incident reporting system cirs the filing of the criminal complaint against dr h had disregarded the internal official channel of reporting irregularities the fact that the applicant had neither verified his suspicions nor contacted an internal body first also showed that he had not acted in good faith the dismissal without notice of the applicant in these circumstances did not have a chilling effect on other employees of the hospital or in the health sector more generally the employers immediate investigations following the disclosure of the information by the applicant rather encouraged these persons to contact internal bodies regarding suspicions of irregularities firstii the courts assessmentα relevant principles the general principles for the assessment of whether an interference with the right to freedom of expression was necessary in a democratic society have been set out in numerous judgments see inter alia steel and morris cited above guja v moldova gc no echr and heinisch cited above in essence the courts task is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation it has to determine whether the interference complained of was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts as regards the application of article of the convention to the workplace the court has held that the signalling by an employee in the public sector of illegal conduct or wrongdoing in the workplace should in certain circumstances enjoy protection this may be called for in particular where the employee concerned is the only person or part of a small category of persons aware of what is happening at work and is thus best placed to act in the public interest by alerting the employer or the public at large see guja cited above marchenko v ukraine no february and langner cited above the court is at the same time mindful that employees owe to their employer a duty of loyalty reserve and discretion see for example guja cited above marchenko cited above heinisch cited above and matúz cited above when assessing in this context the proportionality of the interference with an employees right to freedom of expression in relation to the legitimate aim pursued the court in its caselaw see in particular guja cited above heinisch cited above bucur and toma v romania no january and matúz cited above has had regard to the following six criteria in the first place particular attention shall be paid to the public interest involved in the disclosed information there is little scope under article of the convention for restrictions on debate on questions of public interest see among other authorities sürek v turkey no gc no echr iv and stoll v switzerland gc no echr v the second factor relevant in this balancing exercise is the authenticity of the information disclosed the court reiterates in this context that freedom of expression carries with it duties and responsibilities and any person who chooses to disclose information must carefully verify to the extent permitted by the circumstances that it is accurate and reliable in particular if the person concerned owes a duty of discretion and loyalty to his or her employer and there is question of attacking the reputation of private individuals see handyside v the united kingdom december series a no and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii third on the other side of the scales the court must weigh the damage if any suffered by the employer as a result of the disclosure in question and assess whether such damage outweighed the interest of the public in having the information revealed see guja cited above fourth the court needs to determine whether in the light of the duty of discretion owed by an employee towards his or her employer the information was made public as a last resort following disclosure to a superior or other competent body see matúz cited above unless it is clearly impracticable to disclose the information to a superior or other competent authority see marchenko cited above the court must take into account in this context whether any other effective means of remedying the wrongdoing which the employee intended to uncover were available to him or her see marchenko cited above fifth the motive behind the actions of the reporting employee is another determining factor in deciding whether a particular disclosure should be protected or not for instance an act motivated by a personal grievance or personal antagonism or the expectation of personal advantage including pecuniary gain would not justify a particularly strong level of protection see kudeshkina v russia no february it is important to establish that in making the disclosure the individual acted in good faith and in the belief that the information was true that it was in the public interest to disclose it and that no other more discreet means of remedying the wrongdoing was available to him or her see guja cited above lastly in connection with the review of the proportionality of the interference in relation to the legitimate aim pursued a careful analysis of the severity of the sanction in particular the penalty imposed on the employee and its consequences is required see fuentes bobo cited above β application of these principles to the present case public interest in the disclosed information in determining whether in the light of the above principles the dismissal without notice of the applicant was necessary in a democratic society in the circumstances of the present case the court notes at the outset that the constitutional court in its assessment of the applicants complaint had regard to the abovementioned criteria developed in the courts caselaw see paragraphs above in reviewing under article the domestic courts decision the court observes that the constitutional court recognised that there was considerable public interest in medical treatment in a public hospital which was in accordance with the state of the art the court considers that the information disclosed by the applicant namely the suspicion that a chief physician currently working at the liechtenstein national hospital had repeatedly practised active euthanasia concerned suspicions of the commission of serious offences namely the killing of several vulnerable and defenceless patients in a public hospital as well as a risk of repetition of such offences it agrees that this information was as such of considerable public interest authenticity veracity of the information disclosed as regards the authenticity in the sense of veracity of the information disclosed by the applicant the court can not but note however that the supreme court and the constitutional court in particular found that the suspicions of active euthanasia which the applicant had reported to the public prosecutors office had been clearly unfounded the court observes that the assessment that no active euthanasia had been practised was shared in particular by the two external medical experts n and l who had been asked by the liechtenstein national hospital and the public prosecutors office respectively to examine this question on the basis of the medical paper files see paragraphs and above while the court does not overlook that the applicant contested that his suspicions were clearly unfounded it can not but note that he did not consult all patients paper files despite the fact that expert l saw some room for improvement in the documentation in these files both external experts concluded without any reservations that the patients in question had received necessary and justified palliative treatment the domestic courts in finding on the basis of these reports that the information disclosed by the applicant was clearly wrong and thus did not have a sufficient factual basis therefore relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts the court would stress that information disclosed by whistleblowers may also be covered by the right to freedom of expression under certain circumstances where the information in question subsequently proved wrong or could not be proven correct it recalls in particular that it can not reasonably be expected of a person having lodged a criminal complaint in good faith to anticipate whether the investigations will lead to an indictment or will be discontinued see heinisch cited above however in these circumstances the person concerned must have complied with the duty to carefully verify to the extent permitted by the circumstances that the information is accurate and reliable compare guja cited above and heinisch cited above the court observes that the guiding principles developed by the pace in its resolution on the protection of whistleblowers reflect the same approach stating that any whistleblower shall be considered as having acted in good faith provided he or she had reasonable grounds to believe that the information disclosed was true even if it later turns out that this was not the case see point cited in paragraph above and compare mutatis mutandis heinisch ibid and bucur and toma cited above likewise the guiding principles in the appendix to recommendation cmrec on the protection of whistleblowers provide that protection should not be lost solely on the basis that the individual making the report or disclosure was mistaken as to its import or that the perceived threat to the public interest has not materialised provided he or she had reasonable grounds to believe in its accuracy principle no cited in paragraph above in the present case the applicant as stressed also by the supreme court and the constitutional court see paragraphs and above based his allegations of active euthanasia only on the information available in the electronic medical files which as he had known as a doctor practising in the national hospital did not contain complete information on the patients state of health comprehensive information in this respect was only available in the paper medical files which the applicant however did not consult as the supreme court and the constitutional court determined had he done so he would have recognised immediately that his suspicions were clearly unfounded and he had therefore acted irresponsibly see paragraphs and above by reason of the duties and responsibilities inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression see paragraph above the safeguard afforded by article to whistleblowers is subject to the proviso that they acted in order to disclose information that is accurate and reliable and in accordance with professional ethics compare mutatis mutandis medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no and june this applies in particular if the person concerned like the applicant in the present case as deputy chief physician and thus a highranking and highly qualified employee owes a duty of loyalty and discretion to his or her employer the court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant in the light of the interpretation he had made of the information in the electronic files namely that active euthanasia had repeatedly been practised in the hospital and might continue being practised must have concluded that it was very urgent to act in order to stop that practice however given that as had been found by the domestic courts see in particular paragraph above the applicant as a deputy chief physician could have consulted the paper files at any moment the court considers that this verification would not have been very timeconsuming having regard to the gravity of an allegation of active euthanasia the court therefore agrees with the domestic courts finding that the applicant was obliged to but failed to proceed to such a verification compare also mutatis mutandis medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above he did not therefore carefully verify to the extent permitted by the circumstances that the information he disclosed was accurate and reliable detriment to the employer as for the damage suffered notably by the employer as a result of the disclosure in question the court considers that the allegation of active euthanasia having been practised at a staterun hospital was certainly prejudicial to the employing hospitals business reputation and interests and to the public confidence in the provision of medical treatment in accordance with the state of the art in the only public hospital in liechtenstein it was further prejudicial to the personal and professional reputation of another staff member of that hospital namely the chief physician concerned by the allegations the court observes in this context that the applicant initially did not voice his allegations in public but disclosed them by lodging a criminal complaint in particular to the public prosecutors office which was under a duty of confidentiality see paragraph above however following the ensuing investigations including the seizure of the medical files at the national hospital the applicants allegations became known to a larger public and were quite predictably given the gravity of the allegations repeatedly discussed in the liechtenstein media which risked increasing their prejudicial effect as shown above there was as such a public interest in the revelation of information on suspicions of repeatedly practised active euthanasia in a public hospital however in the present case in which the wellfoundedness of that suspicion had not been sufficiently verified prior to its disclosure the public interest in receiving such information can not outweigh the employers and chief physicians interest in the protection of their reputation existence of alternative channels for making the disclosure as for the question whether the information in question was revealed to an external body as a last resort the court observes that both the supreme court and the constitutional court left open the question whether the applicant prior to raising his suspicions externally should have attempted to raise them internally see paragraph above the court having regard to the circumstances of the case the gravity of the acts at issue and its caselaw compare in particular bucur and toma cited above finds that the applicant could not be expected to first raise his suspicions with his superior dr h who was directly concerned by them as for the internal reporting channel the cirs the court notes that it has not been shown that it had been communicated within the hospital that anonymous reports of irregularities via that system were no longer handled by dr h alone see paragraph above therefore the applicant could legitimately proceed on the assumption that redress could not be obtained in this way either it remains to be determined whether the applicant should have raised his suspicions either with a member of the hospitals foundation board or with the hospitals director prior to lodging a criminal complaint the court notes that in view of the normal professional relationship between the applicant and these bodies and the availability of medical expertise within the hospital these instances appear to be effective alternative channels for disclosure with the potential to remedy any irregularities rapidly however the court does not overlook either that the offences which the applicant suspected his direct superior of were serious and that there was a possibility that he might himself be held liable in case of a failure to report such offences it further takes note of the fact that the guiding principles in the appendix to the committee of ministers recommendation cmrec on the protection of whistleblowers do not establish an order of priority between the different channels of reporting and disclosure stating that the individual circumstances of each case will determine the most appropriate channel see principle no at paragraph above the court considers however that in the circumstances of the case it can leave open the question whether the applicant was obliged to raise his suspicions with the said internal instances of the hospital applicants motives for the disclosure as to the applicants motive for reporting his suspicions of active euthanasia the court observes that the domestic courts did not find that the applicant had acted out of personal motives see paragraph above having regard to the material before it the court does not have reasons to doubt that the applicant in making the disclosure acted in the belief that the information was true and that it was in the public interest to disclose it severity of the sanction finally as regards the severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant the court observes that the applicants dismissal without notice constituted the heaviest sanction possible under labour law compare also guja cited above heinisch cited above and langner cited above this sanction not only had negative repercussions on his professional career it also led to the applicant and his family having to leave liechtenstein as he was to lose his residence permit as a foreign national without employment having regard also to the media coverage regarding the suspicions of euthanasia in liechtenstein the sanction therefore must have had a certain chilling effect on other employees in the hospital and the health sector in general at least as regards the direct disclosure to external bodies of suspicions of irregularitiesiii conclusion having regard to the foregoing considerations the court concludes that the applicant did not act with improper motives however he raised suspicions of a serious offence with an external body without having carefully verified that the information he disclosed which was as such of public interest was accurate and reliable the court further observes that the domestic courts having regard to the criteria developed in the courts caselaw adduced relevant and sufficient reasons for their finding that in these circumstances the applicants dismissal without notice having regard to the prejudicial effect of the disclosure on the employers and the other staff members reputation was justified they struck a fair balance between the need to protect the employers and the staff members reputation and rights on the one hand and the need to protect the applicants right to freedom of expression on the other the court therefore concludes that the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression in particular his right to impart information was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and thus necessary in a democratic society there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimouslydeclares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on february pursuant to rule and of the rules of court stanley naismith jon fridrik kjølbro registrar

44,born in and lives in sochi at the material time the applicant was leader of the local branch of the democratic party of russia and founder of sochi drugoy vzglyad a local newspaper with a circulation of he also occasionally published articles in other local newspapers apparently as a freelancer on march lazarevskaya panorama a local newspaper with a circulation of published an article by the applicant headlined why i will not vote in these elections in which the applicant stated why he would abstain in the presidential election that was due to take place on march the article was placed on the front page of the newspaper that had a headline in large red type saying time to vote there were two subheadings yes in red and no in black the text was divided into two columns the left side gave the statements of five people who were going to vote while the right side contained the applicants article the applicants article read in its relevant parts as follows we are going to have a presidential election soon it is difficult to grasp the game between good and evil this time so here is my decision first of all i am not a puppet in the hands of political gangs who are making a farce out of the presidential election they only need our participation in the election for the sake of giving it an impression of a legal process one which will result in the dislocation of russia this might explain the sad results of government by the two recent rulers of the state as a result we have what we have widespread corruption on a broad platform of lies created by the press under the control of the state and oligarchs platitudes depravity and aggressive propaganda in favour of violence flow out at us from our television screens that is how it all goes however it is all depicted as the reconstruction of the state the strengthening of the economy and the rule of law on the background of growing wealth for the people which people i suddenly thought does it really matter was the answer from the television screen it would not be politically correct to give a specific answer to that to avoid complaints secondly in fifteen years of new style democracy no russian person русский человек has seen anything good he has been pushed down to the level of a simpleton who is to serve various small ethnic groupings that call themselves republics within russia or elsewhere in the russia destroyed by the bolsheviks they were called non russians or the non russian population and no one took offence at the time everyone stayed within his own locality doing his best to make it wealthy no one was irritated by that so what happened where do we stand today those who on account of their ethnic национальные characteristics had engaged in criminal activities or tended their sheep or goats or prayed to their god abandoned their motherland and came here they now call themselves builders entrepreneurs cultural workers or whatever is needed to get their hands into others pockets just look around and you will see crowds of them staring at you greedily at every corner we will be victorious over you all we hold all these kuban people they say during their closed meetings in their own language that of russians do not understand but they will speak russian later when they have totally paralysed our will that is when they will start to burn slaughter rape rob and enslave in line with their barbaric ideas as it was in chechnya but for the time being it is all friendship and solidarity between nations for the time being that is and the president of russia is handing out hero of russia decorations to slave traffickers they participate in the destruction of the country various processes of destruction dominate our society today that is why i will not take part in the election however i express my hope that when taking his decisions the new president will take into account the views i have expressed for myself and for those who are not going to vote on march the article was accompanied by the applicants photograph and indicated that he was leader of the local branch of the democratic party of russia the same text was reprinted in sochi drugoy vzglyad on december the front page of the newspaper had an article titled a campaign of criminal prosecutions on political motives has started in sochi about the criminal proceedings against the applicant for that text see below the article was repeated in small print at the bottom of the same page this issue of sochi drugoy vzglyad also contained a separate page with varying opinions expressed by various people in relation to the applicants text and his ongoing criminal prosecution one comment was made by a lawyer who considered that the main thread of the article concerned various destructive processes in the country arising for instance from inefficient migration policies adversely affected by widespread corruption at the same time the article contained no calls to action in particular violent actions and could not be classified as extremist activity the article also contained a statement by the leader of the lazarevskoye district branch of the armenian union of russia it also contained the applicants open letter in reply to that statement it was specified in the article that on december the applicant had had a meeting with the lazarevskoye district branch it appears that both newspapers were distributed for free by being put into peoples letter boxes within several streets in the sochi area including lazarevskoye village for the second publication in the meantime a criminal preinvestigation inquiry was opened on suspicion of inciting hatred and enmity and at debasing the human dignity of a person or group of people on account of their ethnicity in this connection in august an investigator sought an opinion from professionals in language and psychology ms b and ms r professionals in language and psychology issued their joint report on november the report concluded as follows the text contained statements disclosing a negative attitude toward a social group on the basis of its ethnicity language and religion some phrases extended certain negative characteristics of some members of a non slavic group to the entire group as such the text contained no phrases calling for violence against them on november and then in january the applicant was accused of an offence under article of the criminal code in relation to each publication that offence was punishable by inter alia a fine from to russian roubles rub a court could also prohibit a person from exercising a certain activity for a period up to three years the applicant was charged with committing actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity and at debasing the human dignity of a person or group of people on account of their ethnicity национальность language origin and religious beliefs during the preliminary investigation mr f a specialist in philology also issued a

concluded as follows the article contained phrases disclosing a negative attitude toward a social group on the basis of its ethnicity language and religion those phrases could be perceived as inciting readers to feel hatred and enmity the text did not contain phrases calling for violent actions against a person or a group of people on account of hishertheir social status race ethnicity language gender or religion the criminal case against the applicant was sent for trial before the lazarevskiy district court of sochi the applicant pleaded not guilty and affirmed that the text represented his own personal views and opinions after some minor stylistic changes on the part of the newspapers editor the applicant had approved the publication by way of his signature of the newspaper issues layout the applicant also argued that he had not had anything to do with the publication of his text on december see paragraph above the court examined the documentary evidence including the expert opinions and heard several witnesses for the defence the court dismissed an application by the applicant to summon f for questioning in court about his report apparently neither the prosecution nor the defence deemed it necessary to obtain oral submissions from the other experts whose reports had been admitted in evidence by a judgment of july the district court convicted the applicant of inciting hatred and enmity debasing the human dignity of a person or group of people on account of their ethnicity language origin and religious beliefs the trial court phrased the accusation against the applicant as follows in an intentional and premediated manner the applicant worded the main part of his text by way of an opposition between the people of russian ethnicity русский народ and members of other ethnicities национальности residing in russia while making statements that would be insulting and degrading to the dignity of any ethnicity he indicated that the troubles of the russian population lay in the non russian groups ethnic characteristics thus creating an image of enemies moreover the applicants assessment of the situation of the people of the russian origin is intentionally provocative being aimed at inciting hatred within the people of russian ethnicity toward other ethnicities giving a negative assessment of any group on account of its origin non russian ethnicity or on account of their language or religious beliefs the applicant made statements about criminal propensity of those groups and affirmed the existence of their conspiracy against the kubans that is to say residents of krasnodar region he attributed to the non russian residents bad intentions toward the russian population thereby creating a negative image of people prone to commit crimes in kuban moreover in his article the applicant characterised people of non russian origin as inherently ignorant rude cruel inhuman aggressive and prone to crime against the russian population having secrets plans and conspiracies against people of russian ethnicity the applicants statements about future violent actions on the part of non russian ethnicities toward the russian people are phrased as statements that can not be verified as to their veracity because they have no factual basis and do not go beyond his own speculations clearly being aware that krasnodar region is a multiethnic region and that newspaper articles have an active influence on many people the applicant disseminated his strong views thereby undermining the confidence and respect toward a certain ethnicity a certain religion and inciting hatred and enmity toward a certain way of life culture traditions and religious cults of the non russian population reproducing the concluding remarks from the expert opinions fs report and listing other evidence for each count of the accusation the court concluded that the applicant was guilty as charged as to the publication of the applicants article in sochi drugoy vzglyad on december the court noted that the applicant was the founder of that newspaper that he had signed a contract for printing the relevant issue and paid for it and had then received the whole issue and had distributed it the trial court sentenced the applicant to a fine of rub euros eur at the time for each time the article had been published it also imposed an additional sentence prohibiting the applicant from exercising any journalistic or publishing activities for two years noting the expiry of the prosecution period in respect of the first article the court ordered that the related sentences were not to be enforced as regards the first article the court also held as follows the author made manifestly provocative statements when assessing the situation of the russian people thus inciting his readers of russian origin to feel hatred towards other ethnicities nationalities the author made a negative statement about various groups on account of their origin being different from that of russians thereby the author made intentional statements concerning the criminal propensities of certain groups asserted that there was a plot by non russians against the population of the kuban area that is to say russians living in krasnodar region he said non russians had plans to harm russians thus creating a negative image of non russians he described non russians as ignorant rude cruel or inhuman those are conjectures that are aimed at instilling fear as regards the type of sentence and its severity the court takes into account the nature and degree of dangerousness of the relevant offences the information about the defendants personality the circumstances that plead for mitigating or aggravating the sentence and the sentences potential for correcting the defendants behaviour pursuant to article of the criminal code the two offences committed by the defendant are offences of minor gravity the defendant has been given average reviews from his neighbours no mitigating or aggravating circumstances have been established in view of the foregoing and bearing in mind the aim of restoring the justice and the principle of proportionality the following elements are taken into account the influence of the sentence in terms of correcting the defendants behaviour and noting that it was the first time he had committed those offences of minor gravity that he has been taking care of an elderly mother that he is selfemployed as an entrepreneur thus the court imposes the sentence in the form of a fine given that all the offences concerned a journalistic activity the court finds it necessary to impose an additional sentence consisting in prohibiting him from carrying out a certain type of activity the applicant appealed stating inter alia that the trial courts refusal to summon defence witness f had undermined the defences rights the applicant indicated that f had been interviewed during the preliminary investigation as a specialist and had then submitted a report see paragraph above on september the krasnodar regional court upheld the judgment relying on the expert reports it made no findings relating to the lack of opportunity to put questions to f during the trial for unspecified reasons the applicant did not pay the fine on august the lazarevskiy district court of sochi examined a bailiffs request found that the applicant had manifestly evaded payment of the fine and replaced the fine with two hundred hours of community work other relevant material on december the council of europes european commission against racism and intolerance ecri adopted general policy recommendation no on combating hate speech in its relevant part the recommendation reads as follows the european commission against racism and intolerance ecrirecommends that the governments of member states take appropriate and effective action against the use in a public context of hate speech which is intended or can reasonably be expected to incite acts of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those targeted by it through the use of the criminal law provided that no other less restrictive measure would be effective and the right to freedom of expression and opinion is respected and accordinglya ensure that the offences are clearly defined and take due account of the need for a criminal sanction to be appliedb ensure that the scope of these offences is defined in a manner that permits their application to keep pace with technological developmentsc ensure that prosecutions for these offences are brought on a nondiscriminatory basis and are not used in order to suppress criticism of official policies political opposition or religious beliefsd ensure the effective participation of those targeted by hate speech in the relevant proceedingse provide penalties for these offences that take account both of the serious consequences of hate speech and the need for a proportionate responsef monitor the effectiveness of the investigation of complaints and the prosecution of offenders with a view to enhancing both of theseg ensure effective cooperationcoordination between police and prosecution authorities the explanatory memorandum to the recommendation in its relevant part provides as follows the assessment as to whether or not there is a risk of the relevant acts occurring requires account to be taken of the specific circumstances in which the hate speech is used in particular there will be a need to consider a the context in which the hate speech concerned is being used notably whether or not there are already serious tensions within society to which this hate speech is linked b the capacity of the person using the hate speech to exercise influence over others such as by virtue of being a political religious or community leaders c the nature and strength of the language used such as whether it is provocative and direct involves the use of misinformation negative stereotyping and stigmatisation or otherwise capable of inciting acts of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination d the context of the specific remarks whether or not they are an isolated occurrence or are reaffirmed several times and whether or not they can be regarded as being counterbalanced either through others made by the same speaker or by someone else especially in the course of a debate e the medium used whether or not it is capable of immediately bringing about a response from the audience such as at a live event and f the nature of the audience whether or not this had the means and inclination or susceptibility to engage in acts of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention of his criminal conviction for inciting hatred and enmity and debasing the human dignity of a person or group of people on account of their ethnicity language origin and religious beliefs article of the convention reads in its relevant parts as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others the parties submissions first of all citing the courts caselaw the government mentioned that the complaint had to be dismissed with reference to article of the convention the government argued that the interference in the present case the applicants criminal conviction had been aimed at protecting the rights of others preventing disorder and at solving a potential conflict by legal means there had been a pressing social need to put an end to the dissemination of provocative publications the applicants articles could have incited violence and could have adversely affected the russian legal order правопорядок the applicant had intended to use aggressive language by way of drawing an image of an enemy for inciting and deepening strong destructive feelings hate and anger within its readers should the court consider article of the convention inapplicable the government argued that the criminal sentence had been a proportionate measure in the circumstances of the case the applicant maintained his complaint the courts assessment admissibility the court considers that the governments reference to article of the convention and by implication considerations relating to the applicability of article are closely linked to the merits of the complaint under that article and thus should be joined to the merits see perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extracts and stern taulats and roura capellera v spain nos and march the court also notes that the complaint under article of the convention is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible merits to the extent that the applicant can rely on article of the convention the court reiterates that an interference infringes article of the convention unless it satisfies the requirements of paragraph of that provision it thus remains to be determined whether the interference was prescribed by law sought to pursue one or more legitimate aims as defined in that paragraph and was necessary in a democratic society to achieve those aimsa prescribed by law the court notes that the applicants prosecution was based on article of the russian criminal code he has not raised any specific argument pertaining to whether that interference was prescribed by law the court considers that this criterion has been complied with in the present caseb legitimate aims the government mentioned the aim of protecting the rights of others preventing disorder and solving a potential conflict by legal means in their view the applicants articles could have incited violence and could have adversely affected the russian legal order правопорядок the applicant was convicted for inciting hatred and enmity and debasing the dignity of a group of people on account of their ethnicity language origin and religion as noted in at least one of the expert reports the applicant did not target any specific group by naming it in his article except for an indirect reference to the armenian ethnic group the domestic court found it established that in his article the applicant talked about people residing in krasnodar region and being non russian in that they had a non russian ethnicity andor had arrived in russia from another country andor spoke a language other than russian andor had religious beliefs apparently different from the majority of the population in the region it does not appear that the applicant contested that interpretation the court finds it established and will thus take it into account indeed the applicant affirmed with reference to ethnic characteristics that members of those groups had engaged in criminal activities and that while residing in russia they continued to behave in a criminal manner on the other hand the applicant opposed those groups to the russian population in the sense of an ethnicity at the same time the content of the article reveals that it also focused on the fact that those groups or their individual members had migrated to russia this aspect is also pertinent while being secondary in view of the foregoing considerations the court accepts that the interference in the present case was aimed at protecting the rights of others specifically the dignity of people of a non russian ethnicity residing in the krasnodar region in russia in aksu v turkey gc nos and and echr the court observed that discrimination on account of inter alia a persons ethnicity is a form of racial discrimination racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and in view of its perilous consequences requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction the court also held inter alia that negative stereotyping of an ethnic group was capable when reaching a certain level of having an impact on the groups sense of identity and on its members feelings of selfworth and selfconfidence ibid see also lewit v austria no and october in the courts view there is no basis in the domestic assessment for the governments allegation relating to prosecuting the applicant on account of a risk of violence or more generally any risk of disorder to substantiate that legitimate aim it must be demonstrated that an applicants statements were capable of leading or actually led to disorder for instance in the form of public disturbances such as riots and that the domestic authorities had that in mind when acting to penalise him or her see perinçek cited above and it is uncontested that the applicants article contained no direct or indirect calls to violence indeed the court did not appear to follow the finding made in fs report that the applicants statements contained an indirect call to violent actions against a group of people see paragraphs and above furthermore in the absence of sufficient detail the court does not discern whether the governments reference to adverse consequences for the russian legal order or solving a potential conflict by legal means amounted to legitimate aims in terms of article of the convention the court will now turn to the issue of whether the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression was convincingly demonstrated to be necessary in a democratic society in the pursuance of the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of others as they have been described above see also perinçek cited above and balsytėlideikienė v lithuania no november c necessary in a democratic societyi general principles freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article freedom of expression is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society see bédat v switzerland gc no march offensive language may fall outside the protection of freedom of expression if it amounts to wanton denigration but the use of vulgar phrases in itself is not decisive in the assessment of an offensive expression as it may well serve merely stylistic purposes style constitutes part of communication as the form of expression and is as such protected together with the substance of the ideas and information expressed see gül and others v turkey no june and grebneva and alisimchik v russia no november and the cases cited therein as enshrined in article freedom of expression is subject to exceptions which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly see as a recent authority satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article of the convention the decisions they delivered in accordance with their power of appreciation this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify the interference are relevant and sufficient and whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see among other authorities perinçek cited above when assessing a specific instance of interference with freedom of expression in this type of case various factors should be taken into account including the context in which the impugned statements were made their nature and wording their potential to lead to harmful consequences and the reasons adduced by the national courts to justify the interference in question whether the statements were made against a tense political or social background whether the statements fairly construed and seen in their immediate or wider context could be seen as a direct or indirect call for violence or as a justification of violence hatred or intolerance the manner in which the statements were made and their capacity direct or indirect to lead to harmful consequences it is the interplay between the various factors rather than any of them taken in isolation that determines the outcome of a particular case see mariya alekhina and others v russia no july and ibragim ibragimov and others nos and august in assessing whether the statements could be seen as a direct or indirect call for violence or as a justification of violence hatred or intolerance the court has been particularly sensitive towards sweeping statements attacking or casting in a negative light entire ethnic religious or other groups see seurot v france dec no may soulas and others v france no and july and le pen v france dec no april all of which concerned generalised negative statements about non european and in particular muslim immigrants in france norwood v the united kingdom dec no echr xi which concerned statements linking all muslims in the united kingdom with the terrorist acts in the united states of america on september wp and others v poland dec no september and pavel ivanov v russia dec no february both of which concerned vehement anti semitic statements féret v belgium no july which concerned statements portraying non european immigrant communities in belgium as criminally minded hizb ut tahrir and others v germany dec no june and kasymakhunov and saybatalov v russia nos and march which concerned direct calls for violence against jews the state of israel and the west in general inciting hatred does not necessarily involve an explicit call for an act of violence or other criminal acts attacks on persons committed by insulting holding up to ridicule or slandering specific groups of the population can be sufficient for the authorities to favour combating xenophobic or otherwise discriminatory speech in the face of freedom of expression exercised in an irresponsible manner see féret cited above see also vejdeland and others v sweden no february dmitriyevskiy v russia no october and ibragim ibragimov and others cited above ii application of the principles in the present case in his article the applicant claimed to present his arguments for his decision not to vote in the coming election his reasoning led him to enquire about the notion of the people whose wealth had been growing according to some assessments his ensuing reasoning could be perceived as suggesting that the people of russian ethnicity suffered and non russian groups were to blame his article ended with an appeal to an incoming president of russia to tackle related issues the applicant affirmed with reference to ethnic characteristics that members of those groups had engaged in criminal activities and that while residing in russia they continued to behave in a criminal manner getting their hands into others pockets and conspiring against the kuban people the applicant affirmed that the members of those groups would slaughter rape rob and enslave in line with their barbaric ideas and that they participated in the destruction of russia the applicant was then convicted for his article that as adjudged by the domestic courts incited hatred and enmity and debased the dignity of a group of people on account of their ethnicity language origin and religion for each publication of the article the applicant was sentenced to a fine of rub some eur at the time and was also prohibited from exercising any journalistic or publishing activities for two years noting the expiry of the prosecution period in respect of the first article the court ordered that the related sentences were not to be enforced as regards the first publication of the article as regards the language used in the article the court considers that it was such as to offend shock or disturb having said this the court reiterates that it is the interplay between the various factors rather than any of them taken in isolation that leads it to the conclusion that a particular statement constitutes an expression which can not claim the protection of article or which may be punished by way of criminal proceedings for instance under the legislation pertaining to hate speech as in the present case it has not been contested and the court accepts that the reasons adduced by the domestic courts for convicting the applicant were relevant in the pursuance of a legitimate aim see paragraph above it remains to be ascertained whether those reasons were sufficient in the context of the present case in this connection the court notes that the impugned text was first published during and in relation to an ongoing election campaign in compare féret cited above the underlying intended message of the applicants article was to present his own views regarding nonparticipation in the upcoming election at the same time the court discerns no particular logic or substance in the applicants ensuing discourse pertaining to the negative role of non russian groups visàvis the initial topic being discussed his discourse could not be reasonably perceived as comments criticising any specific policy of the government for instance as regards migration even where a statement amounts to a value judgment the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there is a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement if there is not that value judgment may prove excessive see morice v france gc no echr and cases cited therein the court agrees with the domestic courts that the applicants article furnished no such sufficient factual basis there is nothing in the applicants submissions before the domestic courts or this court to supply any such basis for the sweeping remarks about residents of non russian ethnic groups in krasnodar region and negative stereotyping compare aksu cited above and in this context it is questionable whether the content of the applicants article was capable of contributing to the public debate on the relevant issue compare bédat cited above or that its principal purpose was to do so compare satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above in the present case on the matter of voting in the election or abstaining from it the court also notes that the applicants article was published in newspapers with distribution figures of and within the sochi area which as the trial court pointed out albeit in a cursory manner was situated in a multiethnic region the court agrees with the national courts that the wording of the impugned statements could be reasonably assessed as stirring up base emotions or embedded prejudices in relation to the local population of non russian ethnicity thus even though it was not considered that the article contained any explicit call for acts of violence or other criminal acts it was within the national authorities margin of appreciation to react in some manner see the cases cited in paragraph above lastly the court notes that the sentence in respect of the first publication of the impugned article was not enforced as to the second publication of the same article in the circumstances of the case the court considers that the sentences were proportionate to the aims sought to be achieved the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no echr xi the utmost caution must be exercised where the measures taken or sanctions imposed by the national authorities are such as to dissuade the press from taking part in the discussion of matters of legitimate public concern ibid although the contracting states are permitted or even obliged by their positive obligations under article of the convention to regulate the exercise of freedom of expression so as to ensure adequate protection by law of individuals reputation they must not do so in a manner that unduly deters the media from fulfilling their public watchdog role for instance by way of alerting the public to apparent or suspected misuse of public power as in cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre cited above investigative journalists are liable to be inhibited from reporting on matters of general public interest for instance such as suspected irregularities in the award of public contracts to commercial entities if they run the risk as one of the standard sanctions imposable for unjustified attacks on the reputation of private individuals of being sentenced to imprisonment or to a prohibition on the exercise of their profession ibid the chilling effect that the fear of such sanctions has on the exercise of journalistic freedom of expression works to the detriment of society as a whole is likewise a factor which goes to the proportionality and thus the justification of the sanctions imposed on an applicant who was entitled to bring to the attention of the public an important matter of general interest ibid although sentencing is in principle a matter for the national courts the imposition of a custodial sentence even a suspended one for a mediarelated offence will be compatible with journalists freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the convention only in exceptional circumstances notably where other fundamental rights have been seriously impaired as for example in the case of hate speech or incitement to violence see sallusti v italy no march and cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre cited above prior restraints on the activities of journalists call for the most careful scrutiny and are justified only in exceptional circumstances cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre the court considers however that the context of the present case is different from that in cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre cited above the applicant was sentenced to a nonnegligible fine the trial court also chose to impose an additional sentence consisting in prohibiting him from carrying out any journalistic or publishing activity importantly the sentences in the present case were imposed in the context of the legislation aimed at fighting hate speech in the specific context of the charges against the applicant the sentences were aimed at protecting the rights of others specifically the dignity of people of a non russian ethnicity residing in the krasnodar region in russia compare aksu cited above and the court reiterates in this connection that the contracting states are permitted or even obliged by their positive obligations under article of the convention to regulate the exercise of freedom of expression so as to ensure adequate protection by law in such circumstances andor where fundamental rights of others have been seriously impaired furthermore the court has already indicated its doubt as to whether the content of the applicants article was capable of contributing to the public debate on the relevant issue or that its principal purpose was to do so see paragraphs above the court further notes that article of the criminal code provided for a possibility to adjust the period for a prohibition to carry out a certain activity which could be up to three years as regards the applicant the court limited this additional sentence to two years on account of the circumstances of the case on the other hand it is noted that at the material time the applicant was founder of sochi drugoy vzglyad and only occasionally published articles in other local newspapers such as lazarevskaya panorama apparently as a freelancer apart from his main professional activity as an entrepreneur the court considers that it would not appear from the circumstances of the case that the prohibition to exercise journalistic or publishing activities for two years had any significant practical consequences for the applicant the applicant did not argue otherwise before the court in view of the foregoing the court accepts that the present case discloses exceptional circumstances justifying the sentences imposed on the applicant compare stomakhin v russia no may in particular the court considers that by prohibiting the applicant from carrying out a journalistic or publishing activity for two years the domestic courts did not contravene in the present case the principle that the press must be able to perform the role of a public watchdog in a democratic society see by contrast cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre cited above the court concludes that there has been no violation of article of the convention having reached this conclusion the court considers that it is not necessary to decide whether the present complaint should be dismissed with reference to article of the convention see stern taulats and roura capellera cited above compare perinçek cited above alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that he had had no opportunity to question f the philology specialist the relevant parts of article of the convention read as follows in the determination of any criminal charge against him everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rightsd to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him the parties submissions the government submitted that fs report had been commissioned by the defence the trial court had admitted it to the file alongside fs statement submitted by the defence fs findings had been in line with the expert evidence incriminating the applicant and supporting the charge against him the applicant had had ample opportunities to contest that evidence the applicant submitted no observations in reply within the prescribed timelimit in his application to the court he had merely mentioned with reference to his statement of appeal paragraph above that the trial court had not examined fthe courts assessment admissibility the court notes that the complaint under article of the convention is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible merits the applicable principles have been summarised by the court in matytsina v russia no march and constantinides v greece no october see also murtazaliyeva v russia gc no december as regards witnesses on behalf of the defence neither party has submitted to the court a copy of fs report or his written comments on it none were mentioned in the trial judgment the material before the court does not support the governments allegation that fs report was commissioned by the defence at the same time the applicant considered f as a defence witness apparently in so far as his report had been admitted in evidence upon the defences initiative even though it contained findings that were not favourable to the defence see paragraphs and above the trial and appeal courts provided no reasons for dismissing the applicants request to have f examined in the courts view irrespective of whether fs eventual oral testimony at the trial could be treated as that of a witness either for the prosecution or for the defence in the present case regard should be had to the overall fairness of the proceedings and on that account the complaint should be dismissed for the reasons stated below in so far as it can be deduced from the relevant summaries in the trial judgment fs major findings were consistent with a number of expert reports commissioned in the criminal case see paragraphs and above those findings were unfavourable to the applicant it is true that unlike the expert reports f concluded that the applicants article contained indirect calls to violent actions against the non russian population see paragraph above this finding was not however taken up by the trial court when convicting the applicant it appears that both the trial and appeal courts chose to rely primarily on the expert reports rather than fs report which however was mentioned among the evidence supporting the applicants guilt it has not been alleged and the court does not find that the applicant was restricted in challenging those expert reports during the trial in addition it appears that f had been interviewed during the pretrial investigation it remains unclear what questions the applicant wanted to put to f during the trial or on appeal the court thus considers that notwithstanding the courts omission to state reasons for dismissing the applicants request in the particular circumstances of the present case the refusal to summon f for examination in court in relation to the evidence produced by him that is to say his specialist report did not offend the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant under article of the convention see by contrast kuveydar v turkey no december the court concludes that there has been no violation of article of the convention in the present case for these reasons the courtjoins unanimously the question whether article of the convention is to be applied to the merits of the complaint under article of the convention declares unanimously the complaints under articles and of the convention admissible holds by six votes to one that there has been no violation of article of the convention holds by six votes to one that there has been no violation of article of the convention holds unanimously that it is not necessary to decide in the present case whether article of the convention is to be applied done in english and notified in writing on february pursuant to rule and of the rules of court stephen phillips paul lemmens registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the separate opinions of judges lemmens and serghides are annexed to this judgment pljspconcurring opinion of judge lemmens i voted with the majority in finding that there had been no violation of either article or article of the convention i also voted for holding that it was not necessary to decide whether article was to be applied in this opinion i would like briefly to comment on the relationship between articles and and on the scope of the latter article replying to the complaint based on article the government objected in the first place to the admissibility of this complaint on the ground that the articles written by the applicant fell within the scope of article and were therefore removed from the protection of article this is an objection based on the incompatibility ratione materiae of the article complaint with the convention following a strict logic the court would first have to examine the objection and depending on the outcome of that examination decide whether the complaint was admissible or not if the court found that the statements made by the applicant were covered by article then article would have to be declared inapplicable and the complaint incompatible ratione materiae with the convention without there being any need to examine whether the interference with the applicants freedom of expression was lawful pursued a legitimate aim and was proportionate to that aim see for example garaudy v france dec no echr ix extracts norwood v the united kingdom dec no echr xi hizb ut tahrir and others v germany dec no june and kasymakhunov v russia no november mbala mbala v france dec no echr extracts belkacem v belgium dec no june and roj tv as v denmark dec no april if by contrast the court were to find that the applicants statements were not such that they were covered by article then it would have to declare article applicable and unless the complaint had to be declared inadmissible on another ground proceed with an examination of the merits in the present case the court in effect leaves open the question whether the article complaint is admissible not only does it join the governments objection relating to the applicability of article to the merits see paragraph of the judgment but when it comes to the examination of the merits it arrives at its conclusion without having previously returned to the issue of the applicability of article see paragraph of the judgment indeed the court states that it is not necessary to consider the question of article and thus of the applicability of article see paragraph of the judgment what the court states is in fact as follows without it being necessary to decide whether article is applicable or not that article has in any event not been violated if article had been applied a straightforward conclusion could have been reached by leaving the question of article open the court opts to embark on a normal analysis of the article complaint including an assessment of the proportionality of the interference the latter approach is possible when under the normal analysis of article the conclusion is that the complaint is manifestly illfounded or that there has been no violation of that article see for example williamson v germany dec no january šimunić v croatia dec no january and implicitly pastörs v germany no october if the court had considered that the interference was not prescribed by law did not pursue a legitimate aim or was not necessary in a democratic society it could only have concluded that there had been a violation of article if it had rejected the governments objection based on article see for example vajnai v hungary no and echr fatullayev v azerbaijan no and april rubins v latvia no and january perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extracts stern taulats and roura capellera v spain nos and march and ibragim ibragimov and others v russia nos and august in my opinion it would have been possible for the court to find that the applicants statements were not covered by article and then to conclude that there had nevertheless not been a violation of article see for a similar approach féret v belgium no july indeed the court has made clear that article is only applicable on an exceptional basis and in extreme cases see paksas v lithuania gc no january in cases concerning article of the convention it should only be resorted to if it is immediately clear that the impugned statements sought to deflect this article from its real purpose by employing the right to freedom of expression for ends clearly contrary to the values of the convention see perinçek cited above roj tv as cited above ibragim ibragimov and others cited above and pastörs cited above the decisive point under article is whether the applicants statements sought to stir up hatred or violence and whether by making them he attempted to rely on the convention to engage in an activity or perform acts aimed at the destruction of the rights and freedoms laid down in it see perinçek cited above in the present case the court agrees with the national courts that the wording of the impugned statements could be reasonably assessed as stirring up base emotions or embedded prejudices in relation to the local population of non russian ethnicity see paragraph of the judgment the applicants statements were clearly xenophobic that does not mean however that the statements were totally unprotected under article in my opinion for article to apply and article not to apply there would have to be a call for hatred violence or intolerance see perinçek cited above and compare with the wording used in the judgments cited in paragraph of the present judgment i do not think that the applicants articles can be read as containing such a call the applicant merely vented his own frustration at the presence of non russians article is therefore not applicable and article is applicable for the reasons developed in the judgment i agree that the authorities had good reasons to react to the applicants statements see paragraph of the judgment and that there has been no violation of article dissenting opinion of judge serghides the present opinion is not a fullyfledged one but rather a statement of opinion regrettably i disagree with the courts finding that there has been no violation of articles and the applicant was convicted of inciting hatred and enmity and debasing the human dignity of a person or group of people on account of their ethnicity and was sentenced to a prohibition on exercising any journalistic or publishing activities for two years and in addition to a fine of russian roubles euros at the time for each time his article had been published it is to be noted that the article was published twice regarding article the court in the present case adhered in principle to its previous wellestablished caselaw on the interpretation of article according to which freedom of expression is subject to exceptions which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly see paragraph of the judgment this is rightly stated since it is a requirement or aspect of the principle of effectiveness that limitations or restrictions to rights should be construed strictly and narrowly however in my view the court followed only in theory and not in practice its previous approach regarding the interpretation and application of restrictions to freedom of expression although the court stated that it was applying that approach to the facts of the present case in my view it did not do so i contend that the restrictions imposed on the applicant were not necessary in a democratic society the interference complained of was based on reasons which in the light of the case as a whole were not relevant and sufficient to justify it furthermore in my opinion the sentence imposed on the applicant prohibiting him from exercising any journalistic or publishing activities for two years in addition to the penalty of a fine which was also high was disproportionate in the circumstances thus violating the applicants rights under article and the principle that the press must be able to perform the role of a public watchdog in a democratic society this principle was enunciated inter alia in cumpănă and mazăre v romania gc no echr xi where the court considered that by prohibiting the applicants from working as journalists as a preventive measure of general scope albeit subject to a timelimit the domestic courts contravened the principle that the press must be able to perform the role of a public watchdog in a democratic society as regards article with due respect to the majority i maintain that the fact that the applicant was not afforded the opportunity to question witness f a specialist in philology undermined his rights as a defendant and offended the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings in respect of his rights under article and d and the principle of effectiveness the right to examine witnesses under article d is a minimum right for everyone charged with a criminal offence not permitting the applicant to crossexamine witness f rendered the protection of his right to a fair trial under article neither practical nor effective any other interpretation of article would not reflect its purpose and the notion of fair trial that the evidence of this witness was not favourable to the applicant is clear from the judgment see paragraphs and the domestic courts provided no reasons for dismissing the applicants request to have witness f examined see paragraphs and of the judgment notwithstanding that witness fs report had been admitted in evidence ibid such that it was unavoidable that it had some influence on the domestic judges thinking since i am in the minority it would be a purely theoretical exercise to determine the amount of nonpecuniary damage i would award to the applicant for the above two violations hence i will abstain from dealing with this issue in his application before the court the applicant argued however that the text reflected his own views as a private person a voter a newspapers correspondent and leader of the local branch of the democratic party of russia the fine for the second offence was then converted into two hundred hours of community work on account of the applicants failure to pay the fine,,,
45,background the applicant editorial board of grivna newspaper is a ukrainian single shareholder company which has its registered offices in kherson grivna is a regional newspaper published in that city hereinafter the newspaper in the newspaper published two articles containing negative statements about mr i who from to was president of the kherson regional court of appeal the articles gave rise to defamation proceedings which are the subject of the present case the translation of the relevant parts of the articles is given below the passages which were the subject of the domestic proceedings are underlined and numbered for reference the parts of the articles rephrased and summarised by the court are presented in square brackets where initials are used the actual articles contained is full name his first name surname andor patronymic in various combinations in january the plenary verkhovna rada of ukraine hereinafter the parliament was to examine the question of is appointment to the position of judge on a permanent basis until retirement age the matter was to be examined because is previous tenyear appointment was expiring see the relevant constitutional and legislative rules concerning the appointment of judges at paragraph below prior to the parliaments session on january another regional newspaper vgoru published an article alerting the readers that the matter of is permanent appointment would be examined by parliament and urging readers to send comments on is candidature to the relevant parliamentary committee b article a application no publication on january parliament examined the question of is permanent appointment owing to concerns raised by some members of parliament about is candidature see the summary of the transcript of the debate at paragraph below parliament decided to adjourn the examination of the question an article published in the issue of the newspaper dated january was dedicated to the above event and entitled purgatory for judges чистилище для судей it spread over two full pages the first page of the article contained the following text we often criticise members of parliament and for good reason but this gathering of people with different views and business interests under the same roof sometimes produces unpredictable decisions perhaps it is too soon to call this democracy however the fact that the mps have rejected the advances of the president of the kherson court of appeal mr i получил от народных депутатов гарбуза a speaks volumes so let us talk about justice in the kherson region and first of all about its president mr i below we publish a transcript of the proceedings of parliament concerning appointment of judges for life on january many kherson residents watched live this sitting of parliament and our mr i was the main hero of that show a we have been writing about him much lately other publications have been writing even more we will provide our readers with a brief reminder about mr i based only on our own publications which by the way have not been challenged we are also in possession of a number of incontrovertible documents we give you this in lieu of a prologue in his eight years and counting at the head of the regional court i has found himself dozens of loyal people lawyers judges and important businessmen for whose personal and business interests he has successfully lobbied through favourable judicial decisions a обзавелся десятками преданных людей чей бизнес и личные интересы успешно лоббировал с помощью нужных решений в судахhere is the conclusion i is considered the person in charge and untouchable a in the kherson region where governors succeeded each other in years if one removes him successfully even if peacefully the people will believe in changes for the better in the pervasively corrupt judicial system this document arrived in our offices last autumn it was addressed to a very highranking and influential official in the capital in response to his request for information from kherson but the first official documents had appeared right after i took up his position and they corroborate the abovementioned reasoning here is just a short quote from the letter by members of the regional council to the president of the supreme court dated using his position i received us dollars from g who has been released from serving his sentence and confiscation of his assets he thus helped g avoid his liabilities visàvis his creditors they go on to describe is tricks проделки on two pages a and here is the response of the supreme courts president to the abovequoted episode there followed a quote from a letter of the president of the supreme court stating that in april i had been reprimanded for a breach of professional ethics by the qualifications commission of judges so i has been duly punished at the very dawn of his career it appears that the lesson did him good since our offices have no information about the highest judge of the region receiving any subsequent reprimands a new person became the supreme courts president soon afterwards and i could feel more confident perhaps his relative at the supreme court helped to make it so a a relative so influential that he is now awaiting his appointment to the constitutional court and now is year term as judge is coming to an end new laws provide for lifetime appointment by a majority vote in parliament and here our president has made himself famous nationwide прославился на всю страну a the article then mentioned judge o whose resignation was discussed at the same plenary sitting of parliament as is appointment but mr i is a hard nut to crack and is dreaming of keeping his post no matter what крепкий орешек и несмотря ни на что он мечтает сохранить пост a the first page of the article also contained extensive quotes from articles previously published in february april and may in the same newspaper in particular one dated april which discussed assets allegedly belonging to i and his relatives that article contained quotes from a letter of the chairman of the council of judges dated april the letter contained an acknowledgement that judge d president of the civil division of the supreme court was the fatherinlaw of is son almost the entire second page of the article was taken up by the verbatim reproduction of the transcript of parliaments plenary sitting of january at which parliament examined questions about the appointment and resignation of a number of judges according to the transcript several mps said that they had received complaints about the situation in the kherson regions courts i denied any wrongdoing and stated that all complaints had been checked by the appropriate authorities and found baseless the head of the relevant parliamentary committee stated that the committee had also conducted an inquiry into complaints raised about i and found them to be groundless he also implied that i might have been a victim of a slander campaign orchestrated by aggrieved litigants however in view of the concerns raised by several mps is candidature was withdrawn for additional checks a brief discussion followed concerning judge o from one of the district courts of the kherson region who had presented her resignation to parliament one of the mps made a speech to the effect that judge o had resigned to avoid responsibility for bribery the newspapers reproduction of the transcript was followed by the following conclusion as you can see dear readers representatives of the kherson justice system have distinguished themselves twice it was not only mr i who disgraced himself in front of the entire country a but also his subordinate from one of the district courts mr is photograph was displayed on the first page of the article covering approximately one sixth of the page he was shown in formal attire with a neutral facial expression apparently sitting at a desk under the photograph the following caption appeared i will recompense them according to their deeds old testament mr i is shown in the photo in the same issue of the newspaper another photograph of i was published with the caption parliament so far has not given a life sentence to the president of the kherson court of appeal the copy of the article provided to the court by the applicant company does not contain that second photograph within the next two weeks other newspapers published at least three articles commenting in critical terms on the parliamentary session dedicated to is appointment and his activities in general domestic proceedings i brought a claim in the kherson suvorovsky district court against the applicant company seeking retraction of statements aa and compensation for nonpecuniary damage he argued that the publication in the newspaper which had a circulation of had negatively influenced his professional reputation and public opinion of the judicial system at large triggering actions aimed at putting pressure on the courts namely numerous demonstrations outside the regions courthouses the case was tried by judge s trial judge according to the applicant company in the course of the trial it produced by way of proof of the factual grounds for the impugned statements twentyfive articles published in the local newspapers from to on april the applicant company lodged an application with the supreme court urging it to reassign the case in view of the plaintiffs position to a court in a different region see paragraph below for the relevant domestic legal provision it argued in particular that the trial judge had previously examined a claim lodged by is son himself a vice president of a district court in kherson and had allegedly breached the law in those proceedings it also argued that as a longterm president of the kherson regional court of appeal i had supervisory functions in respect of all judges in the region on april the applicant company asked the firstinstance court to postpone hearings in the case until the supreme court had ruled on its reassignment application i objected the court decided not to postpone the hearings on may the applicant company asked the court to suspend proceedings in the case under article of the code of civil procedure see paragraph below pending examination by the supreme court of its application for case reassignment the court refused the applicant company challenged the trial judge on the grounds that he had rejected its request to suspend the proceedings the judge rejected the challenge on may the firstinstance court delivered its judgment allowing the claimi the court declared a the photographs and captions to them and statements aa and aa baseless insulting and damaging to is reputation and b statement a untrue and damaging to is reputationii the court ordered the applicant company to publish its judgment and awarded i ukrainian hryvnyas uah in compensation for nonpecuniary damage and uah in court fees about euros and euros eur respectively at the timeiii by way of reasoning the court stated that statements aa and aa could not be protected as value judgments since they were deliberately insulting article of the convention permitted restrictions on freedom of expression for the protection of the reputation of others neither the transcript of parliaments plenary sitting nor other documents before the court provided a factual basis for those statementsiv the defendant had failed to prove the truth of the factual statement a or to point to the source of that informationv as to the photographs the court considered that the applicant company had failed to prove that is photographs had been taken either with his consent or at a public event while it was established that the photograph with the biblical quote see paragraph above had been taken at an official meeting on may it presented only i and not the event in general and so was unrelated to the event the defendant had thus exercised the choice of which fragments of the photographs to publish selecting those where only the plaintiff was shown in a certain light combined with the captions added this demonstrated that publication of the photographs was intended as an attack on the plaintiffs honour and dignityvi the totality of the circumstances showed for the court that the applicant companys purpose in publishing the impugned statements and photographs was deliberately to damage is reputation on may the supreme court apparently unaware that the examination of the case at first instance had already been completed reassigned the case to a district court in the mykolaiv region on the grounds that a judge was a party to the proceedings the applicant company appealed against the firstinstance courts judgment arguing in particular that the court had not been impartial because it had refused without giving particular reasons to suspend proceedings while the reassignment application had been pending before the supreme court the applicant company also argued that the firstinstance courts judgment was contrary to article of the convention as to statement a the applicant company alleged that is daughterinlaw the wife of his son was the daughter of d who at the time was the president of the civil division of the supreme court the plaintiff was not contesting that fact the use of the term perhaps in statement a showed that it had been meant to communicate that the author was wondering whether a relatives presence on the supreme court was protecting i rather than being a positive affirmation that this was indeed the case it was thus a value judgment and was true on july the supreme court reassigned the case at is request to the zaporizhzhya regional court of appeal on august the zaporizhzhya regional court of appeal varied the judgment of the firstinstance court and reaffirmed the essential part of its reasoningi the court of appeal reduced the amounts awarded to uah for nonpecuniary damage and uah for court fees about eur and respectively at the time having regard to the applicant companys financial situation and upheld the remainder of the firstinstance courts judgmentii by way of reasoning the court of appeal stated that according to the caselaw of the european court of human rights the fact that the subjects of published information had public status made such persons more open to criticism but did not deprive them of the right to sue to defend their reputationiii the court of appeal found unconvincing the applicant companys argument that it had pursued the legitimate aim of informing the public as opposed to damaging is reputation as president of the regional court given that the impugned statements and captions to the photographs had been presented as a narrative about certain circumstances розповідь про певні обставини the firstinstance courts conclusion that they could not be seen as value judgments but rather as insults had been justified an insult was a statement made not with the purpose of communicating information but with the purpose of insulting a person in its appeal on points of law the applicant company reiterated essentially the same arguments as in its previous appeal see paragraph above as to statement a the applicant company added that a letter from the chairman of the council of judges of ukraine dated april and quoted in the impugned article see paragraph above was in the file the letter was addressed to a certain mr b and contained a detailed response to his complaints against i the council stated in particular that the fact that d was the father of is daughterinlaw did not mean that i had abused his position on march the odessa regional court of appeal acting as the court of cassation amended the lower courts decisions by rejecting is claim for damages retaining only the award of court fees see paragraph i above it held that the very fact of the decisions in his favour constituted sufficient redress for i it upheld the remainder of the lower courts decisions it held in particular that the trial judges failure to suspend proceedings pending examination of the reassignment application by the supreme court did not constitute grounds for quashing its judgment the court held that the aim of the impugned phrases had been solely to humiliate and disparage a representative of the judiciary and the phrases had made no contribution to the resolution of the problems in the administration of justice criticism of a judge was possible in the context of a public debate on problems related to inefficiencies in the judicial system or to a judges lack of independence or impartiality however the impugned article had not discussed those issues as concerns the matter of impartiality of the firstinstance courts judge the court of appel made no comment the court of cassation stated that the fact that that judge had refused to suspend the proceedings and had rejected the challenge against himself see paragraph above did not constitute grounds for quashing the lower courts decisions c article b application no publication the article published in the issue of the newspaper dated may was authored by ms k who was at the time the director of the applicant company and entitled excourt president is burying lady justice under his claims экспредседатель суда завалил фемиду исками its relevant parts read claims raining down on the independent media of the kherson region from mr i who until recently used to be president of the regional court of appeal can not be called anything other than a trend newspapers which take a consistent line in favour of a just and honest judicial system are being targeted it seems that i has had enough of a clear and consistent position of mr s the head of the kherson city committee of the union of retired officers of the armed forces and law enforcement following a defamation claim against the grivna newspaper mr i also sued the vik newspaper which had published ss open letter to the regional governor s had asked the governor to state his position concerning the events which became a topic for examination in the parliament and are constantly in the newspapers in his letter the author appealed to the governments representative in the hope that he would not remain an impartial observer but could influence the situation as regards justice in the region b claims of retired servicemen seeking increases in their pensions to which they are entitled by law have been pending before the courts of the region for two years while in other regions pensioners get the money to which they are entitled by law in our region only several dozen pensioners managed to get their money why do the courts work this way in our region b remarkably this publication in the vik newspaper was not the end of contacts between s and i literally days after the publication of that issue the letter writer and the judge had a conversation at the request of the latter s says that a dressingdown is the only term that can describe the tone of the conversation after this meeting the officers hope of establishing a dialogue with the judge and of clarifying the situation collapsed this was the subject of a new open letter he addressed directly to mr i and then something totally unexpected for the retired submarine officer happened he was attacked at night by strangers received a serious blow to the head obliging him to be hospitalised a coincidence the relevant authorities could answer this question but they initially refused to register ss complaint about the attack he has not been informed about the results of the investigation bthis is the short story of the contacts between s and i the final touch to the story will be a court judgment on the defamation claim the claim will be examined by the same judge st of the suvorovsky district court who surprisingly gets to examine is claims in contrast to the case against our newspaper where i is seeking damages for himself in the case against vik his claims are entirely selfless he is asking that damages be paid to an orphanage charity is of course a laudable enterprise but the editorial boards of both grivna and vik understand that the point of the operation is not to get some money затеяно все далеко не изза желания получить деньги bmost likely court decisions in his favour would come in handy for i when parliament again examines the question of his lifetime appointment claims granted at first instance and on appeal may serve as proof for the argument that journalists unjustified attacks this is how lady justices servants call our critical publications are made up and baseless b especially because judge st does not take into account a seemingly logical idea that if one of the parties is a court or a judge then the case should be examined by a higher court b domestic proceedings i brought a claim against the applicant company and k seeking retraction of statements bb and compensation for nonpecuniary damage as regards in particular statement b the plaintiff submitted that it was based entirely on ss account of the events and that the author of the article had made no attempt to obtain the version of the kherson regional courts staff as far as the attack on s was concerned the story was presented in such a way as to generate a cheap sensation by creating the impression that i was somehow implicated in the attack according to the applicant company in the course of the trial it produced as proof of the factual grounds for the impugned statements twentyfour articles published in the local newspapers from to the applicant company also produced the letter from s to the regional governor reference to which was made in statements b and b in the letter dated february s stated that i possessed property which could not be explained by his lawful income and that the parliament had refused to appoint i on a permanent basis the region was one of the last in ukraine in terms of delivering lawful just decisions in cases of retired military officers who sought to defend their right to a decent pension in the courts s asked the governor to explain why i was still allowed to remain in the position of the president of the regional court and why the governor did not intervene on august the zaporizhzhya shevchenkivsky district court allowed the claim in part ordering the author of the article to apologise by retracting statements bb and the applicant company to publish the retraction in the newspaper the court awarded uah about eur at the time in compensation for nonpecuniary damage from the defendants jointly and severally to be paid to an orphanage the following elements of the district courts reasoning are worthy of notei referring to article of the convention the court stated that the public status of the subjects of publications did not deprive them of the right to protection of their reputation even though the impugned statements constituted value judgments they were insultingii according to the caselaw of the european court of human rights the fact that subjects of the published information had public status made such persons more open to criticism but did not deprive them of the right to sue to defend their reputationiii the impugned statements were insulting the defendants had failed to provide evidence of grounds for such statements and the evidence they did provide did not contain incontrovertible facts which would allow assessment of the person of the plaintiff and the work of the court over which he presided не містять беззаперечних фактів які б дозволили оцінити особу і діяльність судуiv referring to article of the information act setting out objectivity as one of the principles of information relations see paragraph below the court said that the implementation of that principle in respect of value judgments meant that they had to have a basis freedom of the press and protection offered to elements of provocation in journalistic expression could not justify baseless criticism with insulting elements as had occurred in the casev that position was in accordance with the caselaw of the european court of human rights in lingens v austria july series a no it had stressed the need to distinguish between facts and value judgments the truth of which was not susceptible of proof at the same time the district court stressed the following quote from the same paragraph of lingens the court notes in this connection that the facts on which mr lingens founded his valuejudgment were undisputed as was also his good faithvi the district court went on to note that the defendants had failed to provide proof that the facts which the journalist evaluated in the impugned article were undisputedincontrovertible доказів незаперечності оцінених журналістом фактів у даній справі відповідачі суду не надали and therefore the court did not consider that they had acted in good faith in accordance with article of the information act the court concluded that the defendants intention was not to inform the public but rather to spread negative information about the plaintiffvii the court refused to declare statement b defamatory on november the zaporizhzhya regional court of appeal upheld the judgment but modified it to the effect that damages were to be paid to i and not the orphanage since domestic law did not allow for the possibility of directing the funds awarded to a plaintiff to a third party charitable institution the court of appeal agreed with the lower courts assessment of the amount of damages account being taken of the plaintiffs moral suffering and disruption of his social ties including as a public official the firstinstance court had not established that the journalist had acted in good faith and checked the information she disseminated and accordingly no exemption from liability under the state support of media act applied see paragraph below the court of appeal stated that an insult was a statement which was uttered not with the aim of disseminating information but with the aim of humiliating a person on december the odessa regional court of appeal acting as the court of cassation upheld the lower courts decisions it stated that the court of appeals decision was in accordance with the substantive and procedural law and there were no legal grounds to quash it d subsequent events on november i was appointed to the position of judge on a permanent basis and continued to hold the position of president of the kherson regional court of appeal until ii relevant domestic lawa code of civil procedure of the code was entirely restated by the law of october with effect from december from that date the content and the numbering of various provisions changed the provisions below are presented as they stood at the time when the domestic courts examined the applicant companys cases article provided that territorial jurisdiction over a case to which a judge or a court was a party would be determined by a higher court articles provided that the court had to suspend зупиняє proceedings in an exhaustive list of situations notably where it was not possible to examine the case until resolution of another case which was being examined in constitutional administrative civil commercial or criminal proceedings article of the code provided that the court of appeal was bound by the grounds of appeal unless they omitted to mention a flagrant illegality paragraph of the article allowed the court of appeal to examine the evidence if the firstinstance court had unjustifiably refused to examine it or had examined it in breach of established procedure the court of appeal could also examine new evidence if a good reason was shown for failure to produce it before the firstinstance court article provided that the court of appeal could quash the firstinstance courts judgment and deliver its own judgment or could amend the lower courts judgment where the firstinstance court had committed an error of fact or law article of the code provided that a court of appeal had to quash a firstinstance

powers of courts of cassation they provided that a court of cassation could modify a lower courts decision or deliver its own decision on the merits of the case where it established that the lower court had committed an error of substantive law the court of cassation could quash a lower courts decision and remit the case for reexamination in case of a number of serious procedural breaches the

judgments as follows value judgments excluding insults and libel are statements which do not contain factual data in particular criticism evaluation of actions and also statements which can not be

proven d state support of mass media act of article provides that journalists and mass media professionals are exempted from liability for the dissemination of untrue information if the court establishes that the journalist has acted in good faith and has checked the information e rules concerning the status of judges at the relevant time article of the constitution of ukraine provided that following initial appointment by the president for a fiveyear term judges could then be reappointed by parliament until they reached sixtyfive years of age permanent appointment the constitution came into force in prior to that under the status of judges act section and regional court judges were appointed by parliament for tenyear terms section of the judicial organisation act provided that presidents of courts of appeal had a number of representative functions and functions in the organisation of the courts work as far as lower courts were concerned the president of the court of appeal had to collect and analyse courts statistics and practice and for this purpose had the power to request files from the lower courts the presidents also recommended candidates for the positions of president and vicepresident of district courts the lawi joinder of the applications the court considers that pursuant to rule of the rules of court the applications should be joined given their common factual and legal background ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant company complained that the trial judge of the kherson suvorovsky district court who had examined the case concerning article a at first instance was not impartial and that that court had not been a tribunal established by law within the meaning of article of the convention of which the relevant part reads in the determination of his civil rights and obligations everyone is entitled to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law a admissibility tribunal established by law the applicant company submitted that the reassignment of its case by the supreme court had automatically and retrospectively removed jurisdiction from the court which had in fact examined the case prior to the reassignment with the result that the appeal court had been required to quash the judgment and remit the case the government submitted that the higher domestic courts had rejected the applicant companys arguments in that respect and it was primarily for them to interpret and apply domestic law the court notes that the applicant companys reading is not evident from the domestic legal provision invoked by it see paragraph above and it was implicitly rejected by the higher domestic courts moreover the applicant company has failed to present any examples from domestic caselaw which would support its interpretation see mutatis mutandis medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june therefore nothing indicates that the domestic courts interpretation of the domestic law was arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable accordingly this complaint should be rejected as being manifestly illfounded pursuant to article a and of the convention impartiality the court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions in its initial submissions to the court the applicant company submitted that it had challenged the trial judge in particular on the grounds that he had refused its request to suspend proceedings while the supreme court was examining the reassignment application see paragraph above but that same judge had rejected the challenge no reason had been given for the decision to reject the challenge beyond the conclusion that it had been unfounded the government stressed that at the time the firstinstance court examined the case the supreme court had not yet reassigned the case to another court in any case it was primarily for the domestic courts to interpret and apply domestic law domestic law did not require that where reassignment of jurisdiction was requested examination of the case be suspended see paragraph above there were no grounds to doubt the impartiality of the trial judge moreover the judgment delivered by that judge at first instance had then been upheld other than in respect of the amount of damages on appeal at two levels the applicant company did not submit observations in reply to the governments observations on the admissibility and merits the courts assessmenta relevant principles the relevant principles of the courts caselaw concerning the requirement of impartiality were restated in morice v france gc no echr with further references and summarised in mikhaylova v ukraine no march b application of the above principles to the present case the court notes at the outset that judge ss impartiality can not be called into question under the subjective test the court has already examined a situation similar to that which occurred in the present case in gazeta ukraina tsentr v ukraine no and july in that case the applicant company had been sued by a judge who held the post of president of another court in the same region and chaired the regional council of judges the defendants had asked the supreme court to reassign the case to a court in a different region nevertheless the firstinstance court had continued to examine the case while the supreme court was considering the reassignment application which it eventually granted after the firstinstance court had already delivered its judgment in that case the court observed that the supreme courts reassignment decision suggested that the applicant companys fear about a risk of bias of the courts in the region on account of an important position occupied by the plaintiff in the regions courts was not without substance there is no reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case the plaintiff occupied a position of importance in the regions judicial system see mutatis mutandis salov v ukraine no echr viii extracts the procedure for reassignment of cases invoked by the applicant company was intended to ensure the necessary safeguards in cases where parties could have doubts as to the impartiality of a regions courts in such situations the court in its caselaw has often stressed the importance of such safeguards see for example remli v france april reports of judgments and decisions ii the fact that the reassignment application was eventually granted suggests that the applicant companys fears were not seen by the supreme court as baseless because the trial judge failed to allow sufficient time for that procedure to be completed thus depriving it of practical effect the applicant companys fears that that judge lacked impartiality can be held to be objectively justified it is true that the applicant had access to the court of appeal which had full jurisdiction to assess matters of fact and law the impartiality of that court is not open to doubt this may have been sufficient to redress the breach of the impartiality requirement at the firstinstance level see for example helle v finland december reports of judgments and decisions viii however in dealing with the applicant companys appeals the court of appeal and subsequently the court of cassation disregarded its complaints in respect of alleged lack of impartiality see paragraph above therefore they did not remedy the defect in question see for example kyprianou v cyprus gc no echr xiii and henryk urban and ryszard urban v poland no november there has accordingly been a violation of article of the convention on account of the lack of objective impartiality on the part of the trial judge in the proceedings concerning article aiii alleged violations of article of the convention the applicant company complained that the domestic courts decisions holding it liable for the publication of the two impugned articles were in breach of article of the convention which reads everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court notes that the complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissionsa the applicant company in its initial submissions to the court the applicant company argued that the interference with its freedom of expression had not been prescribed by law since the exclusion of insults and libel from the protection afforded by article of the information act see paragraph above lacked foreseeability as those notions were not defined thus resulting in sanctions for value judgments such as the remark that i was a hard nut to crack a even though there was nothing explicitly insulting no profanities or even anything sharply negative in the impugned remarks the aim of the domestic courts decisions had not been legitimate as their real goal had been to punish the applicant company for the publication of information and value judgments on matters of public interest while i had been a judge the domestic courts had not invoked the aim of maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary as their aim as to necessity in a democratic society the applicant company submitted that the press in kherson had been criticising i for corrupt practices since he was in that sense a public figure in january a number of regional publications had alerted the public that i was to be considered by parliament for lifetime appointment see paragraph above i started suing the publications after his appointment had been delayed in parliament article a had been dedicated to the coverage of that parliamentary debate which was clearly of public interest the domestic courts decisions if upheld would mean that the press could only write about positive or neutral events and any dissemination of negative information would be subject to sanctions thus entailing selfcensorship as far as the publication of is photograph was concerned the domestic courts had failed to take into account that he had been photographed at a public event where he had sat on a panel and had thus knowingly exposed himself to the cameras article b had constituted a continuation of the same discussion in the context of the claims brought by i against the publications which covered the scandal involving his stalled permanent appointment that discussion had been of particular public interest as it had concerned the difficulties the top judge of the region had encountered in securing his reappointment a serious sanction had been imposed on the applicant company and there had been little reasoning in that decision in particular the domestic courts had failed to point to any specific circumstances showing that is reputation had been damaged notably after the publications he had continued to hold the post of president of the kherson regional court of appeal the amount awarded was particularly high considering the average level of income in ukraine and higher than what was usually awarded in defamation cases by the ukrainian courts according to the applicant company the awards usually did not exceed uah about eur at the time the fact that i was at the centre of a corruption scandal should rather have militated in favour of lowering the damages if any were to be awarded at all the applicant company did not submit observations in reply to the governments observations on the admissibility and meritsb the government the government did not contest that there had been an interference with the applicant companys freedom of expression they submitted however that it was prescribed by law namely under the provisions of the civil code see paragraph above it pursued the legitimate aim of protecting is reputation protection of the rights guaranteed by article as well as protection of public servants from offensive attacks which were calculated to affect them in the performance of their duties were legitimate interests recognised in the courts caselaw citing radio france and others v france no echr ii and janowski v poland gc no echr i respectively as to the necessity in a democratic society the government referred to the courts statement in perna v italy no echr v that merely to scrutinise each of the statements taken into consideration by the national authorities in reaching their decision that the offence of defamation had been committed would be to lose sight of the articles overall content and its very essence it was significant that i had been a civil servant and therefore the limits of acceptable criticism had been wider than for a private individual the allegations of illegal conduct on the part of a judge had been a matter of public concern and came within the scope of a public debate on a matter of general importance however the principle that freedom of expression carried with it duties and responsibilities applied to the media even with respect to such matters of serious public concern two different courts of first instance in different regions having carefully examined the casefile material the parties statements and the courts caselaw had concluded that the impugned statements could not be protected as value judgments as they had been published with the intention of spreading negative information about i the government stressed that the applicant company had not been ordered to pay any damages in respect of article a as far as article b was concerned the sanction imposed on the applicant company publication of a retraction and payment of damages had been moderate the amount of damages awarded was modest and in addition the applicant companys burden was shared with the codefendant the courts assessmenta existence of an interference prescribed by law legitimate aim the court finds that the decisions of the domestic courts in respect of both newspaper articles constituted an interference with the applicant companys freedom of expression indeed the government did not contest that point the interference was prescribed by law namely the relevant provisions of the civil code see paragraph above and pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation or rights of others see gazeta ukraina tsentr cited above b necessary in a democratic society it remains to be determined whether that interference was necessary in a democratic societyi relevant general principlesα general principles concerning the courts approach to the question of necessity of interferences with freedom of expression the general principles were restated in bédat v switzerland gc no march i freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society as set forth in article this freedom is subject to exceptions which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent courtiii the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts β the role of the press and responsible journalism the court has emphasised the essential function that the press fulfils in a democratic society although the press must not overstep certain bounds particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information its duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities information and ideas on all matters of public interest journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation see delfi as v estonia gc no echr with further references the protection afforded by article of the convention to journalists is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism the concept of responsible journalism as a professional activity which enjoys the protection of article of the convention is not confined to the content of information which is collected andor disseminated by journalistic means that concept also embraces inter alia the lawfulness of the conduct of a journalist including his or her public interaction with the authorities when exercising journalistic functions the fact that a journalist has breached the law in that connection is a most relevant albeit not decisive consideration when determining whether he or she has acted responsibly see pentikäinen v finland gc no echr furthermore article of the convention does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern under the terms of paragraph of this provision freedom of expression carries with it duties and responsibilities which also apply to the media even with respect to matters of serious public concern see for example dorota kania v poland no no october with further references moreover these duties and responsibilities are liable to assume significance when there is a question of an attack on the reputation of a named individual or an infringement of the rights of others thus special grounds are required before the media can be dispensed from their ordinary obligation to verify factual statements that are defamatory of private individuals whether such grounds exist depends in particular on the nature and degree of the defamation in question and the extent to which the media can reasonably regard their sources as reliable with respect to the allegations these factors in turn require consideration of other elements such as the authority of the source whether the newspaper had conducted a reasonable amount of research before publication whether the newspaper presented the story in a reasonably balanced manner and whether the newspaper gave the defamed persons the opportunity to defend themselves ibid γ civil servants and judges as subjects of publication and the limits of acceptable criticism civil servants acting in an official capacity are subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than ordinary individuals see medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above questions concerning the functioning of the justice system an institution that is essential for any democratic society fall within the public interest in this connection regard must be had to the special role of the judiciary in society as the guarantor of justice a fundamental value in a lawgoverned state it must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties it may therefore prove necessary to protect such confidence against gravely damaging attacks that are essentially unfounded especially in view of the fact that judges who have been criticised are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying see morice cited above nevertheless save in the case of gravely damaging attacks that are essentially unfounded bearing in mind that judges form part of a fundamental institution of the state they may as such be subject to personal criticism within the permissible limits and not only in a theoretical and general manner ibid δ the distinction between statements of fact value judgments and insults in its judgments in lingens v austria july series a no and oberschlick v austria no may series a no the court drew a distinction between statements of fact and value judgments the existence of facts can be demonstrated whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself however where a statement amounts to a value judgment the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement see morice cited above as regards value judgments which have been found by the national courts to be of a defamatory character the court assesses the national courts findings on the question whether the language used in the statement was of an excessive or dispassionate nature whether any intention of defaming or stigmatising the opponent was disclosed and whether the statement had a sufficient factual basis see do carmo de portugal e castro câmara v portugal no october with further references moreover a clear distinction must be made between criticism and insult and the latter may in principle justify sanctions see palomo sánchez and others v spain gc nos and others echr the causing of offence may fall outside the protection of freedom of expression if it amounts to wanton denigration for example where the sole intent of the offensive statement is to insult a person however the use of vulgar phrases in itself is not decisive in the assessment of an offensive expression as it may well merely serve stylistic purposes for the court style constitutes part of the communication as the form of expression and is as such protected together with the content of the expression see uj v hungary no july ε balancing of rights under articles and of the convention in order to fulfil its positive obligation to safeguard one persons rights under article the state may have to restrict to some extent the rights secured under article for another person when examining the necessity of that restriction in a democratic society in the interests of the protection of the reputation or rights of others the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases namely on the one hand freedom of expression as protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life as enshrined in article see bédat cited above in order for article to come into play however an attack on a persons reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see axel springer ag v germany gc no february in its caselaw the court has identified a number of relevant criteria whereby the right to freedom of expression is balanced against the right to respect for private life ibid includinga whether the impugned publication contributed to a debate of general interestb how well known is the person concerned and what is the subject of the reportc the prior conduct of the person concernedd the method of obtaining the information and its veracitye the content form and consequences of the publicationf the severity of the sanction imposed where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no echr extractsii application of the above principles to the present caseα whether article interests are in play the court notes at the outset that the applicant company did not contest the governments submissions that the domestic courts decisions pursued the legitimate aim of protecting is rights as guaranteed by article it did not argue that the publications had not reached the requisite threshold of seriousness capable of causing prejudice to is enjoyment of those rights the court sees no reason to find otherwiseβ the courts approach the domestic courts examined the impugned statements and photographs in their combination rather than separately such an approach is as such in line with the courts caselaw indeed the court has held that merely to scrutinise each of the statements taken into consideration by the national authorities in reaching their decisions concerning alleged defamation may lead one to lose sight of the articles overall content and its very essence see for example perna cited above still as in all cases of this type the court needs to ascertain whether the domestic courts gave relevant and sufficient reasons for their decisions and reached conclusions consistent with the convention in that respect the court notes that the two impugned articles contained many distinct elements of different nature and gravity thus in the particular circumstances of the present case an adequate analysis of the reasons given by the domestic courts can only be conducted by drawing a distinction between different elements of the articles see for a similar approach tara and poiata v moldova no october and stomakhin v russia no may the court will therefore proceed to examine the two impugned articles and the domestic courts decisions concerning them in the light of the criteria established in its caselaw and set out in paragraph above the court will first focus on the general criteria such as the subject of the publication which are common for the two articles then it will proceed to examine the content and form of the articles and the domestic courts assessment separately in respect of each of them while considering the articles as a whole the court will have particular regard to their disputed parts see for example tønsbergs blad as and haukom v norway no march the court will conclude by an overall assessment taking into account in particular the severity of the sanctions imposed on the applicant companyγ both articles contribution to a debate of general interest how wellknown was i his prior conduct and the consequences of the publications the domestic courts found that the impugned articles made no contribution to a debate of general interest in that they pursued the aim of insulting i rather than informing the public see in particular paragraphs iii and above the court observes that both of the impugned articles were published in the context of the parliamentary procedure concerning is permanent appointment to the post of judge this procedure had already been the subject of press comment prior to the publication of the first of the impugned articles see paragraph above in the course of the debate concerning is appointment mps discussed allegations of misconduct against him this procedure was public and had incidence on is role as president of the regional court of appeal for the court these factors argue in favour of the conclusion that the impugned articles made a certain contribution to a debate of general interest it is a different matter however whether all the impugned elements of the articles made a contribution to that debate in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism this is a matter which the court considers it appropriate to examine below separately in respect of each article the domestic courts implicitly acknowledged that i was a public figure see paragraphs ii and ii above but did not refer to the fact that he was a judge and was thus subject to a duty of discretion that precluded him from replying through the media see morice cited above moreover neither the domestic courts nor the parties before the court provided any specific information on is prior conduct as to the consequences of the published articles the court does not see any reason to disagree with the domestic courts assessment that is reputation was harmed by them however it also observes that they did not have any dramatic impact on is career since shortly after the publications he was reappointed to his judicial post on a permanent basis and continued to hold the position of president of the regional court of appeal for years afterwards see paragraph aboveδ article a the content and form of the impugned statements and the photographs the court considers that in terms of content and form article a contained five distinct elementsi comments on the failure of is candidature before parliament statements a a a and a and statement a to the effect that is misdeeds were reported as far back as ii statement a concerning is relative on the supreme courtiii is photograph with the biblical quotationiv is other photograph which has not been submitted to the courtv supposed quotes from a report to a highranking official about is alleged misconduct statements a and a the court will examine each of those elements and the domestic courts reasoning in their respect in turn comments on the failure of is candidature before parliament a a a and a and statement to the effect that is misdeeds were reported as far back as a the court considers that statements a a a and a constituted mere comments on the failure of is candidature before parliament in its plenary sitting and clearly had a sufficient factual basis namely the debate at that public meeting the impugned expressions though sarcastic remained within an acceptable degree of stylistic exaggeration employed to express the authors value judgment no profane vulgar or patently offensive language or imagery was used they were thus value judgments and had a sufficient factual basis the mere fact that they were expressed in a sarcastic form is not sufficient to classify them as insults essentially the same considerations apply to statement a which was a merely sarcastic description of the content of the document which had contained complaints about is supposed misdeeds there is no indication that the veracity of the document was ever in doubt and the fact that i had indeed been disciplined on that occasion was not questioned in summary the court considers that for an objective reader the above statements could not be read as insults statement concerning is relative on the supreme court a the domestic courts did not specifically comment on the applicant companys argument that the father of is daughterinlaw was indeed a supreme court judge see paragraphs and above this fact was never seriously in dispute accordingly the court also has difficulty understanding the reasons for the domestic courts finding that statement a was untrue it appears although this is not stated in the decisions that the courts took issue not with the existence or not of family relations between i and a supreme court judge but rather the part of the statement which suggested that that supreme court judge had helped i feel confident in his position however that part of the statement was quite vague and was qualified by the word perhaps whether it is seen as a statement of fact or a value judgment it had a sufficient basis in the fact that the plaintiffs relative did indeed sit on the supreme court and that that situation was at least not unfavourable to the applicant as he himself for a long time occupied a highranking position in the judiciary the impugned article merely stated that there was a possibility of a causal connection between those two facts and did not assert that there was in fact such a connection the domestic courts failed to give any reasons for their finding that the factual basis for that statement was insufficient is photograph with the biblical quotation the domestic courts limited their examination of that photograph to observing that the applicant company had failed to prove that it had been taken with is consent or was published as part of covering a public event and that the choice of the published fragment of the photograph and its combination with the caption had been intended to present i in a certain light see paragraph v above that was the extent of the courts reasoning on this issue the courts implicitly acknowledged that the photograph was taken at a public event they discarded this circumstance however considering that the publication of the photograph was unrelated to covering of the public event in question while this is a relevant consideration the analysis could not stop there and other criteria set out in paragraph above are relevant of those other criteria the domestic courts commented only on i being a public figure see paragraph above their comment on the content and form of the photograph is so succinct that it is difficult to understand they failed to explain what was precisely the certain light in which the photograph presented i thus the court finds that the domestic courts failed to give sufficient reasons for their ruling in respect of the photograph and its accompanying caption is other photograph which has not been submitted to the court since the applicant company has not submitted the other impugned photograph see paragraph above the court has no basis on which to question its assessment made by the domestic courts supposed quotes about is misconduct from a report to a highranking official statements a and a those statements pointed to misconduct on the part of the plaintiff presenting him as a person who had developed a network of connections with persons of influence they were presented as quotes from a document supposedly available to the applicant company that document was provided neither to the court nor to the domestic courts and the applicant company failed to explain this in any way for example by the need to protect its sources in fact the applicant company did not even assert before the courts that the document really existed the court therefore considers that it has not been shown that in making these statements the applicant company acted in good faithε article b the content and form of the impugned statements the court considers that in terms of content and form article b contained two distinct elementsi statements bb describing interactions between s an aggrieved litigant and i as the court presidentii statements b and b to the effect that is lawsuits against the applicant company and another newspaper were meant to improve is reputation before reexamination of his candidacy for permanent appointment by the parliament the domestic courts categorised those statements as value judgments see paragraph iii above the court does not need to take a definitive position on this point since even in case of value judgments proportionality of an interference depends on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for such a judgment the domestic courts concluded that there was no such basis the court will first examine the overall standards used by the domestic courts in reaching that conclusion and will then examine each of those two groups of statements in turn to see if the domestic courts conclusions in their respect were based on relevant and sufficient reasons and consistent with the convention requirements the standard employed by the domestic courts the court must stress the wellestablished principle of its caselaw that the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself see lingens cited above there is a fundamental difference between the legitimate requirement that journalists act in accordance with the precepts of responsible journalism notably by conducting a reasonable amount of research before publication and presenting the story in a reasonably balanced manner see dorota kania cited above and on the other hand a requirement antithetical to freedom of expression for the author of a value judgment to show that the factual basis for the statement is either uncontested or incontrovertible it was the latter impossibletofulfil standard that the firstinstance court used see paragraph iii above by contrast the domestic court of appeal did refer to the provision of the domestic law which exempted journalists from liability if they acted in good faith and checked the information they disseminated and concluded that the applicant company had failed to comply with that lower standard see paragraphs and above therefore the flaw in the firstinstance courts standard is not in itself decisive the court still needs to ascertain whether the domestic courts gave reasons and reached conclusions consistent with the convention in respect of each of the relevant groups of statements statements bb describing interactions between i and s an aggrieved litigant the applicant company has not shown either before the domestic courts or before this court that it conducted any good faith research to verify the veracity of the factual elements of statement b notably the innuendo that i had somehow been involved in the attack on s an aggrieved litigant who had criticised him the applicant company has not pointed to any evidence to support that innuendo or its efforts to obtain it it thus failed to comply with the tenets of responsible journalism therefore the court has no basis on which to question the assessment made by the domestic courts in respect of statement b statements b and b were closely linked to b as they all described the interactions between i as the court president and s therefore the court sees no reason to disagree with the domestic courts assessment in their respect either statements b and b to the effect that is court claims against the applicant company and another newspaper were meant to improve is reputation before reexamination of his candidacy for permanent appointment by the parliament these statements constituted comments on is motivation in bringing his claims little if any concrete proof could conceivably be cited for them the court considers that the fact that the claim was brought after the initial failure of the plaintiffs candidacy for permanent appointment in the parliament constituted sufficient factual basis for those statements the domestic courts failed to explain their reasons for finding otherwiseζ overall assessment of the necessity for the interference in view of the above the court finds that the interference was not based on sufficient reasons in respect ofi statements a a and a to a and is photograph with the biblical quotationii statements b and b as far as those elements of the impugned articles were concerned the domestic courts have failed to conduct the balancing exercise in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw in addition the court notes that the damages the domestic courts awarded to the plaintiff in the proceedings concerning article b can not be considered negligible taking into account the nature of the impugned statements and other circumstances analysed above as far as the remaining elements of the impugned articles are concerned the interference was based on sufficient reasons see paragraphs to and above even considering the damages awarded in respect of article b the applicant company has failed to show that the authorities overstepped their margin of appreciation and that the interference was not necessary in a democratic society there has accordingly beeni a violation of article of the convention on account of the domestic courts decisions in respect of statements a a a to a is photograph with the biblical quotation and in respect of statements b and bii no violation of article of the convention on account of the domestic courts decisions in respect of the remaining impugned elements of articles a and biv application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court finds that there has been a violation of the convention or the protocols thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party a damage the applicant company claimed eur corresponding to the amount which was allegedly levied from its bank account in execution of the domestic courts decisions in respect of pecuniary damage and eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage in support of the latter claim it alleged that owing to the impugned decisions of the domestic courts it had been in a state of stress from to the government contested those claims considering them unsubstantiated in respect of the pecuniary damage claimed they submitted that in the event of a finding of a violation the applicant company would be entitled to request review of the decision of the court of appeal concerning article b under which that amount had been levied on its account in respect of the nonpecuniary damage claim the government voiced their doubts as to whether the applicant company as a commercial entity could suffer stress and claim compensation for such damage the court notes that the government did not contest that the amount claimed in respect of pecuniary damage had been levied in execution of the domestic courts decisions concerning article b the court has found a violation of article on account of those decisions in respect of two statements in article b and no violation of that provision in respect of the majority of the statements in that article it is unclear from the domestic courts decisions which part of the award was to be attributed to each of the statements compare krone verlag gmb h co kg v austria no no december it appears that the statements in respect of which the court found no violation of article were actually the most damaging finally only a small part of the total amount awarded eur was actually collected therefore the court is unable to conclude that there is a causal link between the cost borne by the applicant company and the violation it has found the court accordingly dismisses its claim for pecuniary damage at the same time the court in view of the violations found considers that an award of compensation for nonpecuniary damage is justified in this case ruling on an equitable basis it awards the applicant company eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage b costs and expenses the applicant company made no claim for costs and expenses accordingly the court makes no award under this head c default interest the court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the european central bank to which should be added three percentage points for these reasons the

46,the applicants were born in and respectively and live in lecco the first applicant is the editor of a local online newspaper in the province of lecco the other two applicants are journalists working for the newspaper in the course of their activities the applicants used radio equipment to access frequencies used by the police or the carabinieri this enabled them to learn of any communications transmitted in that way so that they could arrive quickly on the scene when wishing to report on specific incidents on august the applicants listened in on a conversation during which the merate carabinieri operations centre decided to send a patrol to a location where according to anonymous sources weapons had been stored illegally the carabinieri accordingly went to the location mentioned and the second and third applicants arrived on the scene immediately afterwards having obtained a search warrant the carabinieri searched the applicants car finding two frequencymodulation transmitterreceivers that were capable of intercepting police radio communications the carabinieri then went to the two journalists editorial office and seized two fixed radio receivers which were tuned to the frequencies used by the carabinieri other frequencies used by police operations centres were stored in the devices memory a the criminal proceedings against the applicants at first instance criminal proceedings were instituted against the first and second applicants for illegally installing equipment designed to intercept communications between lawenforcement agencies operations centres and patrols articles bis and bis of the criminal code the third applicant was charged with accessing the aforementioned communications articles and bis of the criminal code on november the lecco district court acquitted the applicants it held that the relevant articles of the criminal code were to be interpreted in the light of article of the constitution which only protected communications of a confidential nature the district court observed that the radio device used by the lawenforcement agencies was unable to ensure the confidentiality of the information it transmitted accordingly the interception of the communications in question did not constitute an offence moreover the possession and use of radio receivers were not prohibited as such b proceedings on appeal the milan principal public prosecutor and the lecco public prosecutor appealed they argued that the lecco district courts interpretation was inconsistent with the court of cassations caselaw in such matters citing in particular judgment no of january and that the communications in issue were clearly confidential bearing in mind the aims of ensuring public safety and protecting public order in addition the communications concerned the initial investigations following the commission of an offence they were therefore subject to a confidentiality requirement pursuant to article of the code of criminal procedure the confidential nature of the communications was also obvious from the fact that the carabinieri used coded language for communications concerning the location and the type of intervention clearly seeking to ensure that no third parties had knowledge of the information being exchanged in addition the radiofrequencies involved had been exclusively assigned to operations centres by the ministry of defence furthermore in order to listen in on the conversations the applicants had had to purchase special radio equipment as ordinary equipment could not be used for this purpose on the other hand the fact that such devices were freely available on the market did not justify their use for intercepting conversations between lawenforcement officers in addition in accordance with presidential decree no as in force at the material time devices of this kind were intended to be purchased by amateur radio operators but could not be used to intercept police radiofrequencies lastly the ministry of communications decree of february had expressly prohibited amateur radio operators from intercepting communications which they were not entitled to receive c judgment of the milan court of appeal in a judgment of may the milan court of appeal found the first and second applicants guilty and sentenced them to one year and three months imprisonment the third applicant was sentenced to six months imprisonment the court of appeal suspended the applicants sentences it observed that article bis of the criminal code as amended by law no of november had extended the scope of criminal responsibility to cover all remote data transmission thus including the interception of conversations between the lawenforcement agencies operations centres and patrols such communications were moreover clearly confidential reiterating all the arguments put forward by the milan and lecco public prosecutors particularly regarding the aims of ensuring public safety and protecting public order the court of appeal held that article of the code of criminal procedure was also at issue in the present case d proceedings in the court of cassation the applicants appealed to the court of cassation they contended that the communications in question had been transmitted on unencrypted frequencies and thus could not be treated as confidential furthermore they had been acting in a professional capacity as journalists and their actions were therefore justified under article of the criminal code and in terms of freedom of the press in a judgment of october the court of cassation found against the applicants upholding the court of appeals position as to the confidential nature of the communications and reiterating that this interpretation was consistent with its own approach in similar cases particularly in judgments no of may and no of january addressing the applicants argument concerning freedom of the press the court of cassation stated that the right to impart information which they had relied on might have prevailed over the public interests protected by criminal law in a case of alleged defamation however that right could not take precedence in a case concerning the illegal interception of communications between lawenforcement officers the lawalleged violation of article of the convention relying on article of the convention the applicants complained about the search of their vehicle and their editorial office the seizure of their radio equipment and their conviction they submitted that these measures had constituted disproportionate interference with their freedom of expression particularly in relation to their access to information as journalists this article reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary b merits the parties submissions the applicants submitted that the measures taken against them had not been proportionate to the aims referred to by the respondent government and that the right to impart information should prevail in their case they further contended that the custodial sentences imposed on them had been excessive the government observed that even assuming that there had been interference with the right relied on by the applicants it had pursued legitimate aims namely the protection of national security and public safety and the prevention of disorder and crime and had been proportionate to those aims the courts assessmenta whether there has been an interference prescribed by law and the legitimate aims pursued the court reiterates its doubts as to whether there was an interference with the applicants freedom of expression in the present case even assuming that article was applicable it observes that the search and seizure operation and the custodial sentences imposed on the applicants were prescribed by law namely by article of the code of criminal procedure and articles bis and bis of the criminal code the court considers that the measures in question pursued legitimate aims for the purposes of article of the convention in particular the protection of the rights of others and concerning more specifically the interception of police communications the protection of national security and the prevention of disorder and crimeb whether the measures taken against the applicants were necessary in a democratic societyi general principles the general principles concerning the necessity of an interference with freedom of expression were summarised in pentikäinen v finland gc no echr in that judgment the court reiterated that the protection afforded by article of the convention to journalists was subject to the proviso that they acted in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism see mutatis mutandis bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i kasabova v bulgaria no and april and times newspapers ltd v the united kingdom nos and nos and echr furthermore the concept of responsible journalism is not confined to the contents of information which is collected andor disseminated by journalistic means it also embraces inter alia the lawfulness of journalists conduct including their public interaction with the authorities when exercising journalistic functions see pentikäinen cited above it should also be reiterated that notwithstanding the vital role played by the media in a democratic society journalists can not in principle be released from their duty to obey the ordinary criminal law on the basis that as journalists article affords them a castiron defence see among other authorities mutatis mutandis stoll v switzerland gc no echr v bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above and monnat v switzerland no echr x in other words a journalist can not claim an exclusive immunity from criminal liability for the sole reason that unlike other individuals exercising the right to freedom of expression the offence in question was committed during the performance of his or her journalistic functions see pentikäinen cited above furthermore all persons including journalists who exercise their freedom of expression undertake duties and responsibilities the scope of which depends on their situation and the technical means they use see for example handyside v the united kingdom december in fine series a no thus notwithstanding the vital role played by the press in a democratic society journalists can not in principle be released from their duty to obey the ordinary criminal law on the basis that article affords them protection paragraph of article does not moreover guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern see stoll cited above and pentikäinen cited above lastly the court reiterates that in assessing the necessity of a specific interference with the exercise of freedom of expression it has regard to several criteria namely the assessment of the competing interests the applicants conduct the review carried out by the domestic courts and the proportionality of the penalty imposed see stoll cited above pentikäinen cited above and boris erdtmann v germany dec no january ii application of these principles in the present case it should be noted at the outset that unlike other cases where journalists have applied to the court under article of the convention including among many other examples stoll cited above the present case does not concern the prohibition of a publication but the taking of measures against journalists for actions that according to the italian legal system contravened criminal law in order to assess the necessity of these measures the court observes that the interests to be weighed up in the present case are firstly the public interest in the proper functioning of the lawenforcement agencies and secondly the interest of readers in receiving information although both these interests may be regarded as public in nature see mutatis mutandis stoll cited above it should nevertheless be pointed out that the public interest in knowing about local news items can not carry the same weight as the public interest in obtaining information about a matter of general and historical concern or of considerable media interest subjects which the court has already had occasion to examine in this connection it notes that the stoll case cited above concerned the dissemination of information about the compensation due to holocaust victims for unclaimed assets deposited in swiss bank accounts the pentikäinen case cited above concerned the dissemination of information about a demonstration taking place on an exceptional scale in national terms in protest against an asia europe meeting in the present case the court observes that the applicants were not prohibited from bringing news items to the publics attention their conviction was based solely on the possession and use of radio equipment in order to obtain relevant information more rapidly by intercepting police communications which were confidential under domestic law the limits of the prohibition are an important consideration in the assessment of its proportionality in this context the court considers that the decisions of the milan court of appeal and the court of cassation to the effect that communications between lawenforcement officers were confidential and that the applicants actions were therefore to be classified as criminal conduct were properly reasoned the decisions relying on settled caselaw of the court of cassation accorded substantial weight to the protection of national security and the prevention of disorder and crime the court further notes that as it has previously held see stoll cited above and pentikäinen cited above the severity of the penalty imposed on the applicants is also a factor to be taken into consideration in assessing the proportionality of the interference complained of in the present case the penalty consisted of custodial sentences of one year and three months for the first two applicants and six months for the third together with the seizure of their radio equipment the court reiterates that the concept of responsible journalism requires that whenever a journalists conduct flouts the duty to abide by ordinary criminal law the journalist has to be aware that he or she is liable to face legal sanctions including of a criminal character see pentikäinen cited above in the present case while seeking to obtain information for publication in a local newspaper the applicants acted in a manner that according to domestic law and the settled approach of the court of cassation contravened criminal law which lays down a general prohibition on a persons interception of any conversations not intended for him or her including those between lawenforcement officers the applicants actions moreover involved a technique which they used routinely in the course of their activities as journalists see paragraph above lastly the court notes that in its judgment of may the milan court of appeal suspended the applicants sentences and that there is no evidence in the case file to show that they served them accordingly the penalties imposed on the applicants do not appear disproportionate the courts made an appropriate distinction between the applicants duty to abide by domestic law and their pursuit of their activities as journalists which was not otherwise restricted having regard to the above factors the court concludes that there has been no violation of article of the convention in the present case for these reasons the court unanimously holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in french and notified in writing on june pursuant to rule and of the rules of court abel campos mirjana lazarova trajkovska registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the separate opinion of judge spano is annexed to this judgment mltacconcurring opinion of judge spanoi the applicants the director of a local news portal and two of its journalists were convicted of illegally accessing radio channels used by the police during the latters activities as the information so obtained by the journalists was considered confidential under the italian criminal code the court finds no violation of article of the convention i concur in the judgment however i am writing separately as i consider the reasoning adopted by the court to be somewhat too broad in substance investigative journalism is an important feature of democratic societies as history has demonstrated responsible journalism can if pursued effectively uncover information of great value for the public interest and thus promote and strengthen the fundamental democratic values of accountability and transparency as the court has previously held the concept of responsible journalism as a professional activity which enjoys the protection of article of the convention is not confined to the content of information which is collected andor disseminated by journalistic means that concept also embraces inter alia the lawfulness of the conduct of a journalist including his or her public interaction with the authorities when exercising journalistic functions importantly the mere fact that a journalist has breached the law in his or her journalistic activity is a highly relevant albeit not decisive consideration when determining whether he or she has acted responsibly as the court held in its grand chamber judgment in stoll v switzerland gc no echr v although it may be undisputed that a journalist has violated the criminal law for example as in stoll by publishing information that was confidential the mere fact that a journalist has acted in breach of a criminallaw provision is not the end of the matter for the purposes of the necessity and proportionality assessment which must be carried out under article of the convention otherwise contracting states would be free to subject journalists to criminal sanctions whenever they came close to uncovering activities that cast those in power in an unfavourable light and would thereby subvert the vital role of the press in the functioning of a democratic society but it is clear that journalists can not claim exclusive immunity from criminal liability for the sole reason that unlike other individuals exercising the right to freedom of expression they committed the offence in question during the performance of their journalistic functions all persons including journalists who exercise their freedom of expression undertake duties and responsibilities the scope of which depends on their situation and the technical means they use see pentikäinen v finland gc no echr and stoll cited above ii the applicants complain that the seizure of their vehicle and radio equipment and their subsequent conviction constituted a disproportionate interference with their freedom of expression within the context of their attempts to access information as journalists the court begins its inquiry by leaving open the question whether the applicants suffered an interference within the meaning of article of the convention as the court finds in any event that even assuming that such an interference occurred it was justified on the facts see paragraph of the french version of the judgment this may be a prudent course of action as it can be difficult to determine whether prepublication activity as part of investigative journalism is conduct which in itself triggers the protections of article of the convention however on the particular facts of this case i would have been comfortable in finding that article was indeed applicable and that an interference occurred here i consider differently from my colleagues see paragraph of the french version of the judgment that such a finding would have been logically consistent with the recent findings of the grand chamber in pentikäinen cited above where the court considered that the applicant in the exercise of his journalistic functions had been adversely affected as he was present at the scene as a newspaper photographer in order to report on the events when he was apprehended by the police detained for hours and later charged and found guilty by the domestic courts of the crime of disobeying the police i agree with the findings of the court on the issues of lawfulness and whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim see paragraphs of the judgment at paragraph the court then correctly refers to the following stoll criteria as the framework for the analysis of the facts see my dissenting opinion in pentikäinen cited above the interests at stake the review of the measure by the domestic courts the conduct of the applicant and whether the penalty imposed was proportionate see stoll cited above however it is in the application of these criteria to the facts of the case that i find the reasoning problematic and overly broad in scope i would have applied a narrower more factsensitive analysis in the following manner firstly although i agree that the facts do not disclose the same kind of public interests as those at stake in stoll or pentikäinen the assessment should not have been limited to stating in abstract terms that the interest in the present case was limited to the publics right to be informed of trivial items of a general nature on a local news portal see paragraph of the judgment the publicinterest inquiry should rather have been directed more intensely at the nature of the confidential information that the journalists were actually seeking to obtain so as to be able to inform the public indeed and very importantly there are situations where journalists may be justified under article of the convention in deciding to pursue aggressive investigatory strategies in their work even accessing confidential information if the public interest in disseminating the information in question is strong for example in the case of efforts to uncover corruption or illegal activities by government officials or elected representatives also the fact that the newspaper is published for the benefit of a local community is irrelevant in my view also considering that the content of the news portal in question was published online having said that even analysing the case through this narrower more factsensitive prism it nonetheless transpires that the nature of the information obtained by the applicants was not paramount from the perspective of the public interest the applicants accessed the police radio channel and used the information so obtained in order to be present at the scene of an everyday lawenforcement operation the applicants have to bear the burden under article of the convention for having resorted to illegal means in obtaining confidential information without their actions being justified by the existence of a strong public interest the second issue i find problematic relates to the fact that the court considers correctly that the italian courts applied a rule of domestic criminal law which proscribes in a general manner the interception of confidential conversations including police communications see paragraph of the judgment in other words the domestic courts did not engage in a balancing of the conflicting interests at stake as is normally required in article cases of this nature under the second of the stoll criteria which concerns the review of the measure by the domestic courts in my view the court should have recognised this problematic nature of the domestic courts review having already rejected the governments nonexhaustion of domestic remedies argument that the applicants had not invoked their right to freedom of expression at domestic level see paragraph of the french version of the judgment however taking account of the applicants complaint viewed as a whole on the basis of the stoll criteria and in particular the relatively little weight that can be attached to the public interest at stake when balanced against the applicants criminal behaviour in obtaining the information in question i concur in the judgment,,,
47,the applicant was born in and lives in cluj napoca he is a university professor and contributor to various magazines and newspapers mainly of an economic and financial nature at the time of the relevant events he had already published more than articles in various local or national publications prior to parliamentary elections held at the end of november the applicant wrote an article about mii who was standing as a candidate for one of the national parties the article headlined attention he also wants to be in parliament was published on the front page of f a newspaper on november it read as follows after five rounds of free parliamentary elections ordinary people who are politically active only when they vote have come to an uncontroversial conclusion there is something wrong with people who become candidates for various political functions without even knowing exactly what is wrong most people of good moral and professional character often choose not to vote any more they make that choice especially when they learn that the person appearing on the electoral poster asking for votes has never done anything remarkable in his or her profession it is therefore no longer surprising that the romanian parliament is the institution that enjoys the least public confidence time has consolidated the publics belief that most candidates want to become parliamentarians so that they can for a couple of years take advantage of the privileges they grant themselves or of those informal benefits which come through the development of the system of relationships associated with their functions there are candidates who do everything to become parliamentarians in order to shield their criminal record from the criminal acts they committed before becoming senators or deputies among the many cases of that type i today present you one and if i do this it is not to help the voters because imposture by an individual reveals itself without reserve to the perceptive masses whereas one by a group or party does not especially when one can use all the presidential and municipal logistical powers impressive amounts of funds and an unsuspected power to persuade individuals with little training one such case is that of mr mii this gentleman is in good physical condition especially after living a comfortable life as a manager at r cluj a public company and now wants to use his skills in parliament and he does not intend to reach such a position only based on his wellknown lucidity but also with the help of some financial support for the intellectual efforts he wishes to make for the benefit of the many for that purpose he borrowed billion romanian lei for a period of months namely until october to invest on the stock market and earn a bit more than the creditor would request as interest based on perfectly legal documents it is just that at one point the moral profile of this representative of the democratic party of cluj showed itself clearly not having made as much profit as he hoped the candidate mii decided not to repay the loan thus contracted after imploring the creditor to have mercy to postpone and not enforce the contract even though he knows that the contract weighs against him he is relying on that defect of romanian justice of postponing the adjudication of cases in fact mr mii brought a case before a court which had no jurisdiction to assess the case but he hopes in the near future to be able to invoke his immunity as a member elected by the nation just like his spiritual guardian who left us without a maritime fleet that is why i say that we must be careful about what mr mii signs and promises for the following day he might no longer admit to anything he may switch to another political party if he is given more he may even sell part of the electoral district where he ran and if nobody wants it he can go to smirnov because it is warmer in tiraspol than in huedin on april mii brought a civil action against the applicant he sought euros eur for nonpecuniary damage as the article had allegedly seriously affected his reputation and made him lose the election by approximately one hundred votes mii also complained about the publication by the applicant of another defamatory article on january which was in a similar vein he also complained about the distribution of leaflets before the election which had reproduced the contents of the article of november he alleged that all the material had been meant to discredit him as a candidate the applicant confirmed that he was the author of the article in question and that everything he had written had been true as proved by documents from the arbitration tribunal of the cluj chamber of commerce which would become available to the court he further denied contributing in any way to the publication or distribution of other articles and leaflets concerning mii on july the cluj napoca court of first instance allowed the claims lodged by mii and held that the article of november had contained defamatory statements about him it further held the applicant liable to pay eur for nonpecuniary damage and romanian lei ron in legal costs the court held that the applicant had not proved that his statements were true the procedure before the arbitration tribunal invoked by the applicant in his defence had concerned a commercial dispute between mii and the applicants brokerage company in which the claims of mii had been partially granted on april as the repayment deadline had been set for april the court considered that even if true the applicants statements had been defamatory and should not have been made public in the media especially since they concerned matters of a private commercial nature the court further noted that the applicants statements had been reproduced in electoral leaflets which had been distributed in several public places in bus stations and private mailboxes the court held that even if it was not the applicant who had produced or distributed the leaflets there was a causal link between the publication of the article and the harm caused to miis reputation because if he had not produced his article in the first place there would have been no leaflets and no amplification of the negative effects on miis image the court then focused on the terms used by the applicant in his article in particular calling the defendant an impostor which was found to be insulting and lacking factual justification as there existed no criminal complaints of fraud against mii it concluded that the language used conveying the idea that mii would accept any compromise for money and would therefore betray the electorate his party and his country had exceeded the limits of admissible criticism and had disparaged him the applicant appealed arguing before the cluj county court that the publication of the article in question during a parliamentary election campaign had had the role of informing the public in good faith about a political figure in such a situation the limits of admissible criticism were wider he argued that during election campaigns the press had the essential role of informing the public about future members of the romanian parliament he argued that the amount of damages awarded by the firstinstance court had been disproportionate and had had an obvious punitive purpose in a final judgment of january the county court essentially upheld the reasoning of the lower court it considered that the manner in which the applicant had acted proved that he had not complied with the duties and responsibilities inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression the seriousness of his allegations and of the acts imputed to mii hold him the applicant responsible for showing the highest rigour and a special caution the lack of which would breach the rights of others the county court confirmed that the lower court had correctly estimated that it had been necessary to balance the right to private life on the one hand and freedom of expression which contributed to a debate of public interest on the other holding that to insult to defame a person can not be justified and legitimate when one party aims to unilaterally expose in the press private litigation of a commercial nature involving two private parties in assessing the existing conflict between the exercise of freedom of expression in the press and the necessity to protect the reputation and the rights of others the court estimates that even though the applicants allegations made in a press article during an electoral campaign concerned a potential member of the romanian parliament thus were of public interest there are limitations to freedom of expression the applicant having been bound to act within the limits given by the public interest in protecting the reputation and the rights of another person including his or her right to be presumed innocent undoubtedly when the article was published in the newspaper f the applicant did not comply with the minimum requirements of diligence prescribed by article of the convention in the sense of acting in good faith and in accordance with the journalistic ethics so as to ensure that the provided information be trustworthy notwithstanding the dose of exaggeration or provocation allowed in such situations nevertheless the county court allowed the applicants appeal in part and reduced the damages to eur considered to be more proportionate to the damage sustained by miiii relevant domestic law the relevant provisions of the romanian civil code in force at the time concerning tort liability are cited in ghiulfer predescu v romania no june the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the obligation imposed on him by the domestic courts to compensate mii for nonpecuniary damage had amounted to a breach of his right to freedom of expression guaranteed under article of the convention he relied in addition on article and article of the convention the court is of the view that it suffices to examine the complaint solely under article which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits arguments of the parties the applicant submitted that his publication of the article for which he had been found liable had pursued the aim of informing the public about mii a public person aspiring to become a parliament deputy he argued that the statements had not infringed any of the rights set down in the convention being purely a manifestation of his own right to freely impart public information he further stated that he was not challenging the proportionality of the measure but rather the sanction itself considering that the domestic courts had abused their powers after being influenced by the political nature of the case the government submitted that the interference had been provided for by law namely articles of the civil code in force at the time see paragraph above it had been legitimate aiming at protecting the rights of others and finally it had been proportionate as a fair balance had been struck between the right to reputation of a third party mii and the applicants rights in that respect they argued that the statements had concerned facts of a serious nature which however had been outside the limits of political debate moreover the applicant had been unable to establish the truthfulness of what he had written although he had been given the possibility to do so lastly the sanction had not been excessive or unreasonable in support of their arguments the government cited mihaiu v romania no november and ciuvică v romania dec no january the courts assessment the parties do not dispute the fact that the domestic courts judgments amounted to an interference with the applicants exercise of the right to freedom of expression the court also finds that the interference complained of was prescribed by law namely articles of the civil code in force at the time see paragraph above and pursued the legitimate aim referred to in article of the convention namely the protection of the reputation or rights of others what remains to be established is whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society when examining the necessity of an interference in a democratic society in the interests of the protection of the reputation or rights of others the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see hachette filipacchi associés v france no june and mgn limited v the united kingdom no january the court emphasises that in order for article of the convention to come into play an attack on a persons reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and its manner must cause prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see a v norway no april and axel springer ag v germany gc no february where the balancing exercise between those two rights has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see mgn limited cited above and and palomo sánchez and others v spain gc nos and others echr the relevant criteria in this regard are a the contribution made by the article to a debate of general interest b how well known is the person concerned and what is the subject of the report c the conduct of the person concerned prior to publication of the article d method of obtaining the information and its veracity e content form and consequences of the publication and f severity of the sanction imposed see axel springer ag cited above the court also reiterates that a distinction has to be made between private individuals and persons acting in a public context as political figures or public figures accordingly whilst a private individual unknown to the public may claim particular protection of his or her right to private life the same is not true of public figures see minelli v switzerland dec no june and petrenco v moldova no march in respect of whom limits of critical comment are wider as they are inevitably and knowingly exposed to public scrutiny and must therefore display a particularly high degree of tolerance see ayhan erdoğan v turkey no january and kuliś v poland no march see also milisavljević v serbia no april and von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr in the present case the court notes that the applicants criticism was directed at mii a candidate in parliamentary elections for a national political party he was thus a politician in respect of whom the limits of acceptable criticism are wider than in the case of a private individual see lingens v austria july series a no and satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no echr extracts by standing in the parliamentary elections mii entered the political scene and inevitably and knowingly laid himself open to close scrutiny scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large for these reasons he was required to display a greater degree of tolerance for similar reasoning see among the most recent authorities genner v austria no january nevertheless the court also notes that the applicant was sanctioned for his statements in particular his utterance of the idea that mii was an impostor a person who was ready to accept any compromise and betray his electors for financial advantage according to the cluj napoca court of first instance those insulting expressions harmed miis reputation and dignity and should not have been made public via the media especially because they referred to private matters see paragraph above furthermore the court took into consideration the harmful effect that the distribution by third parties of electoral leaflets reproducing the content of the applicants article had had on miis reputation see paragraph above it emphasised the necessity to balance the right to private life on the one hand and the freedom of expression on the other this reasoning was upheld by the county court which underlined the seriousness of the applicants allegations and of the acts imputed to mii and considered that these statements had not been trustworthy notwithstanding the dose of exaggeration or provocation allowed in such situations see paragraph above moreover in their assessment the domestic courts took into account the context in which the impugned allegations had been made namely during an electoral campaign and confirmed the fact that they had been of public interest in so far as they had concerned a public figure the court considers it relevant that in reaching the conclusion to allow in part the claim in the defamation proceedings against the applicant the domestic courts considered that the latter had not intended to criticise miis activity as a public figure but rather to publicly expose a unilateral view of private litigation of a commercial nature involving two private parties in this respect they also held that the applicant had not complied with the minimal requirements of diligence in the sense of acting in good faith see again paragraph above in the light of the above the court agrees with the domestic judicial authorities that the impugned statements were an attack on miis reputation reaching the requisite level of seriousness and causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of his right to respect for private life under article it also finds that the domestic courts did undertake a satisfactory balancing exercise between the rights at stake in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw furthermore they convincingly established the need for placing the protection of the defendants right to protection of reputation above the applicants freedom of expression in this context the court recalls that it would require strong reasons to substitute the courts view for that of the domestic courts see paragraph above such strong reasons are lacking in the present case lastly the court observes that the applicant was ordered to pay damages of eur see paragraph above and takes note of the fact that the applicant has not shown what his financial situation was at the time and whether or not he struggled to pay that amount furthermore it has not been argued let alone shown that the amount the applicant was obliged to pay had a disproportionate impact on his financial situation in fact the applicant did not in any manner rely on the severity of the sanction but rather contested the measure itself see paragraph above the court is therefore satisfied that in the particular circumstances of the present case the imposed sanction can not be found to have been disproportionately severe see mutatis mutandis dorota kania v poland no no october and genner v austria no january and can not be considered to have been capable of having a chilling dissuasive effect on the applicants exercise of his right to freedom of expression having regard to all the foregoing factors and the margin of appreciation afforded to the state in this area the court concludes that the domestic courts struck a fair balance between the applicants freedom of expression under article and miis right to have his reputation respected under article and that this assessment was made in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court declares unanimously the application admissible holds by five votes to two that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on january pursuant to rule and of the rules of court marialena tsirli ganna yudkivska registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the separate opinion of judges de gaetano and vehabović is annexed to this judgment gymtjoint dissenting opinion of judges de gaetano and vehabović we regret that we can not share the view of the majority in this case that that there has been no violation of article of the convention in the instant case the applicants criticism was directed at mii a candidate in parliamentary elections for a national political party mii was thus to all intents and purposes a politician in respect of whom the limits of acceptable criticism are wider than in the case of a private individual see lingens v austria july series a no and satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june by standing in the parliamentary elections mii entered the political arena and inevitably and knowingly laid himself open to close scrutiny scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large for these reasons he was required to display a greater degree of tolerance see among the most recent authorities genner v austria no january the applicant was punished for his statements in particular his utterance of the idea that mii was an impostor a person who was ready to accept any compromise and betray his electors for financial advantage according to the cluj napoca court of first instance those statements had harmed miis reputation and dignity and should not have been made public via the media especially because they referred to private matters see paragraph of the judgment furthermore the court took into consideration the harmful effect that the distribution by third parties of electoral leaflets reproducing the content of the applicants article had had on miis reputation see paragraph however and this is crucial for our dissent the domestic courts failed in our view to undertake a balancing exercise between m iis reputation and the applicants freedom of expression in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw they also attached no particular relevance to the overall context of the text the general aim of the applicants article was to draw voters attention to the question of miis suitability to be a candidate for national public office the statements in the article therefore concerned a matter of public interest for the local community even if some of them might appear harsh or farfetched as a general rule the court considers that opinions and information pertinent to elections which are disseminated during an electoral campaign should be considered as forming part of a debate on questions of public interest unless proof to the contrary is offered according to the courts caselaw in respect of matters of public interest restrictions on freedom of expression should be interpreted narrowly see by way of example kość v poland no june furthermore we are of the view that the domestic courts did not clearly assess whether the contested statements were value judgments and if they were whether there was a sufficient factual basis for them see for example morice v france gc no echr while it is true that some of the applicants statements such as those concerning miis alleged imposture and propensity to make immoral compromises could be considered statements which lacked a sufficient factual basis the thrust of the applicants article was to cast doubt on the suitability of a local politician for public office admittedly the applicants article and in particular the expressions used could be considered as polemical involving at least a certain degree of exaggeration the court however has stated that persons taking part in a public debate on a matter of general concern are allowed to have recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation or in other words to make somewhat immoderate statements see mutatis mutandis do carmo de portugal e castro câmara v portugal no october and the instant case is about exactly that we are of the view that the said expressions do not amount to a gratuitous personal attack because the author supported them with an objective explanation namely the existence at the time of the article of an actual commercial dispute before the arbitration tribunal concerning miis alleged refusal to repay a loan see paragraph of the judgment moreover the court has also held that in the field of political debate political invective often spills over into the personal sphere such are the hazards of politics and the free debate of ideas which are the guarantees of a democratic society see among the most recent authorities lykin v ukraine no january in the light of all this and in the absence of any pertinent reasoning provided by the domestic courts in line with the courts caselaw we can not consider that the applicant acted in bad faith the applicant was moreover ordered to pay damages to the tune of eur see paragraph of the judgment the court has repeatedly noted the chilling effect that a fear of sanction has on the exercise of freedom of expression although the applicant has not shown what his financial situation was at the time and whether or not he struggled to pay that amount we are of the view that in the circumstances the sanction imposed was capable of having a chilling dissuasive effect on the applicants exercise of his right to freedom of expression see for instance lombardo and others v malta no april and ghiulfer predescu v romania no june to sum up we are of the view that the domestic courts failed to strike a fair balance between the relevant interests and to establish a pressing social need for putting the protection of miis reputation protected by article of the convention above the applicants right to freedom of expression under article of the convention and this in the context of political repartee we therefore ineluctably conclude that the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression was not necessary in a democratic society and that there has accordingly been a violation of article of the convention,,,

content of the leaflets according to the applicant vg had merely taken hold of one of her friends and asked for assistance from other officers in order to carry out the arrest she noted that they had been attacked and arrested without being able to understand that vg was a police officer during the same hearing the applicants lawyer maintained that the applicants trial for distributing leaflets was in violation of her rights enshrined in the european convention of human rights and in particular her right to freedom of expression and demonstration on various dates the applicants coaccused gave evidence before the kars criminal court they all contended that they had not been asked to show the leaflets or their identity cards but had been arrested through the use of force although they had not resisted arrest on march the kars criminal court convicted the applicant of obstructing the police officers in the execution of their duties and insulting them under article of the criminal code and sentenced her to eleven months and twenty days imprisonment the firstinstance court noted that the police had gone to the scene of the incident as they had received information that members of tayad were distributing leaflets in the light of the statements of the officers who had signed the police report the medical reports and the arrest report the kars criminal court found it established that the accused had insulted the police officers shouted that they would neither show their identity cards nor give the leaflets and injured vg by way of hitting him with their bags taking into account the fact that the applicant did not have any criminal record her personality traits and her conduct during the hearings the firstinstance court considered that the applicant would not commit any further offence it therefore decided to suspend the pronouncement of the judgment against her hükmün açıklanmasının geri bırakılması for a period of five years pursuant to article of the code of criminal procedure law no on may the decision of march became final meanwhile the kars public prosecutor initiated an investigation against vg and hö on the charge of abuse of office upon the complaints lodged against them by the applicant and her friends on august the kars public prosecutor decided that no proceedings should be brought against the police officers in the public prosecutors opinion the applicants injuries had possibly been caused when she and her friends had resisted the police officers who had been performing their duties the public prosecutor noted in his decision that some of the police officers had also been injured during the incident on december the applicants lawyer filed an objection against the public prosecutors aforementioned decision in his petition the lawyer noted that the decision in question had not been served on him or his client and that they had become aware of it when the lawyer went to the courthouse to read the documents in the case file on the same day the applicants lawyer also noted that the applicant had been subjected to violence by the police and that she had not hit the police officers on december the ardahan assize court dismissed the applicants objection against the kars public prosecutors decision following an examination on the merits the assize court considered that the force used by the police officers had been no more than necessary to counter the applicants resistance the applicant claimed that this decision was not communicated to her or her lawyer and was put in the investigation file her lawyer became aware of it when he consulted that file on january there is no document in the investigation file submitted by the government demonstrating the notification of the decisions of august and december to the applicant or her lawyer ii relevant domestic law section of the law on the duties and powers of the police law no read as follows at the material time in order to protect national security public order public health and morals or the rights of others to prevent crime and to detect all kinds of weapons explosive materials or other prohibited items the police can conduct

placese public spaces or places open to the public the police shall search individuals clothes vehicles private documents and items with a view to prevention of crime and send any crimerelated items

on criminal and preemptive searches regulation no entered into force on june section of law no a police officer can ask individuals to present their identity documents after presenting a document demonstrating that he or she is a police officer for the prevention of crime or in order to apprehend perpetrators of crime everyone is under the obligation to present a national identity card a passport or any other official document proving his or her identity when asked by the police section e of regulation no security forces are operationally independent in carrying out the following controls where the conditions are fulfillede asking individuals to present their identity documents in order to prevent commission of crime according to section of the former law on associations law no of a copy of leaflets to be distributed by associations had to be filed for information purposes with the head of the local administrative authority and the public prosecutors office for the area and no leaflet written statement or similar publication could be distributed until twentyfour hours after it was filed on november the new law on associations law no came into force the new law does not impose any obligation of informing the state authorities of the content or the distribution of associations leaflets article of the criminal code reads as follows resistance with a view to obstructing the execution of duties article anyone who uses methods of violence or threats against a public officer with a view to obstructing him or her in the execution of his or her duties shall be liable to imprisonment of between six months and three years the lawi alleged violations of article of the convention the applicant complained under articles and of the convention that her suffering at the hands of the police officers had amounted to illtreatment and that her allegations of illtreatment had not been effectively investigated by the national authorities the court considers that these complaints should be examined from the standpoint of article of the convention which reads as follows no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment the government contested those arguments a admissibility the government asked the court to dismiss these complaints for failure to comply with the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies under article of the convention in this regard they stated that the kars public prosecutors decision of august had been served on the applicant and that she should have lodged an objection against that decision the government submitted in the alternative that the applicant should have lodged her application with the court within six months of the date of the kars public prosecutors decision as regards the governments objection that the applicant failed to exhaust the domestic remedies available to her the court observes that the applicant lodged an objection against the decision of august which was dismissed by the ardahan assize court following an examination on the merits had the kars public prosecutors decision been officially served on the applicant or her lawyer at an earlier date as claimed by the government the assize court would have dismissed the applicants objection on procedural grounds for noncompliance with the timelimits the court further notes that the government failed to submit any information or documents to show that the applicant had learned about the decision of august prior to december the date on which the applicants lawyer claimed to have become aware of the decision in question the court therefore dismisses the governments objection under this head as to the governments submission concerning the sixmonth rule the court reiterates that in turkey an appeal against decisions of public prosecutors not to prosecute constitutes in principle an effective and accessible domestic remedy within the meaning of article of the convention see epözdemir v turkey dec no january saraç v turkey dec no september hıdır durmaz v turkey no december pad and others v turkey dec no june nurettin aldemir and others v turkey nos and december and i̇nan and others v turkey nos and october in this connection the court observes that the applicant availed herself of this remedy by lodging an appeal against the kars public prosecutors decision thus the final decision regarding the applicants allegations under article of the convention is the decision of the ardahan assize court dated december the court further notes that according to the applicants submissions the decision of the ardahan assize court was never served on her or her lawyer she claimed that her lawyer had found out about the content of this decision when he consulted the investigation file on january the government on the other hand did not seek to challenge the veracity of the submissions of the applicant nor did they submit to the court any explanation or documents demonstrating that the decision in question had been served on the applicant or her lawyer having regard to the governments failure to challenge and refute the applicants claims and given that the applicant lodged her application with the court on july that is to say within six months of january the court concludes that with regard to her complaints under article the applicant complied with the sixmonth rule the court therefore rejects the governments submission that the applicant should have introduced her allegations of illtreatment to the court within six months of the date of the kars public prosecutors decision the court notes that this part of the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the responsibility of the respondent state in the light of the substantive aspect of article of the convention the applicant submitted that she had been subjected to physical and psychological violence both during her arrest and when she was detained in police custody in particular she and her friends had been beaten by thirty police officers and threatened and sexually abused by the arresting officers the government argued that the police had been obliged to use force as the applicant and her friends had resisted arrest and that the force employed had not been excessive they further noted that the contents of the medical reports of am and pm issued on october had been exactly the same demonstrating that the applicant had not been subjected to illtreatment while in police custody the court observes at the outset that it is not disputed between the parties that the applicant sustained the injuries noted in the medical report issued at am on october during her arrest effected on the same day in this connection the court reiterates that article does not prohibit the use of force for effecting an arrest however such force may be used only if indispensable and must not be excessive ivan vasilev v bulgaria no april and the cases cited therein the court is faced with two conflicting versions as to how the applicant sustained these injuries the applicant alleged that she had been beaten subjected to sexual assault threatened and insulted by the police whereas the government claimed that the applicant had resisted arrest and sustained injuries as a result of her own conduct the court notes in this connection that according to the medical reports issued after the arrest of the applicant and her friends the arrestees as well as one of the arresting police officers were injured the doctor who examined the applicant and the police officer considered that the injuries sustained by both of them had no lasting consequences see paragraphs and above the court considers that the treatment described by the applicant would have left more serious marks on her body see tüzün v turkey no november besides given that the applicant was held in police custody only for a few hours she could have sought to obtain a further medical report in support of her allegations after her release from custody on the other hand the court observes that the applicant raised allegations of battery sexual assault and threats both before the national authorities and the court and that the medical reports submitted to the court lack detail and fall short of both the standards recommended by the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cpt and the guidelines set out in the istanbul protocol which are regularly taken into account by the court in its examination of cases concerning illtreatment see inter alia akkoç v turkey nos and echr x and the guidelines set out in the istanbul protocol see batı and others v turkey nos and echr iv extracts as such the court considers that the medical reports in question can not be relied on as evidence for proving or disproving the applicants allegations of illtreatment see mehmet eren v turkey no october gülbahar and others v turkey no october and ballıktaş v turkey no october having regard to the above and in the absence of any other proof the court considers that there is no evidence to corroborate or refute the applicants allegation that she was illtreated by the police during her arrest and detention hence the court can not conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the injuries sustained by the applicant were the result of illtreatment or of the use of disproportionate force by the police or that she was sexually assaulted or threatened as alleged there has therefore been no violation of article of the convention under its substantive limb the responsibility of the respondent state in the light of the procedural aspect of article of the convention the applicant complained that her allegations of illtreatment had not been effectively investigated by the national authorities the government contested the applicants submissions submitting that an investigation had promptly been initiated into the applicants allegations of illtreatment with a view to establishing whether the applicant had been illtreated and identifying and punishing those responsible had there been illtreatment the court reiterates that article of the convention requires the authorities to investigate allegations of illtreatment when they are arguable and raise a reasonable suspicion see in particular ay v turkey no march in the present case the court has not found it proved on account of a lack of evidence that the applicant was illtreated nevertheless as it has held in previous cases that does not preclude her complaint in relation to article from being arguable for the purposes of the obligation to investigate see among many other authorities yaşa v turkey september reports of judgments and decisions vi ay cited above gülbahar and others cited above böke and kandemir v turkey nos and march gök and güler v turkey no july and aysu v turkey no march the court considers that the injuries sustained by the applicant and the applicants complaints submitted to the competent domestic authorities created a reasonable suspicion that at least those physical injuries might have been caused by an excessive use of force or illtreatment as such her complaints constituted an arguable claim in respect of which the national authorities were under an obligation to conduct an effective investigation in this connection the court notes that the kars public prosecutor initiated an investigation against two police officers vg and hö following a request for an investigation into their allegations of illtreatment lodged by the applicant and her friends see paragraphs and above the court however considers that the applicants allegations were not effectively investigated by the domestic authorities for the following reasons firstly the kars public prosecutor failed to take statements from the suspected police officers in particular the officers who had arrived at the scene of the incident in order to support vg and hö were not at all heard by the public prosecutor besides vg and hö were not questioned as suspects in the investigation but made statements to the public prosecutor in their capacity as the complainants in the other investigation brought against the applicant and her friends see paragraph above secondly as the court has noted above the medical reports issued in respect of the applicant lack detail and fall short of both the standards recommended by the cpt and the guidelines set out in the istanbul protocol in particular only the physical injuries on the applicants body were noted in the medical reports of october the doctors who examined the applicant neither noted her account of events in the sections entitled information regarding the incident and the complaints of the person examined in the reports nor carried out any psychiatric examination and completed the section entitled psychiatric examination the court considers that had the applicant failed to state any of the complaints that she subsequently raised before the national authorities and the court the medical practitioners should have noted that she did not make any comments relevant to these sections they also failed to include their observations concerning the cause of the applicants injuries in the courts view the kars public prosecutor should have questioned the quality of those reports before basing his decision on them or requested a further medical examination what is more the kars public prosecutor took no steps on his own initiative to identify possible witnesses in the courts view given that the events in question occurred in a residential area in kars and that the applicants were distributing leaflets to the residents of that area the public prosecutor could have taken statements from those who lived in the neighbourhood in question in sum the court concludes that the applicants allegations of illtreatment were not subject to an adequate and effective investigation as required by article of the convention there has accordingly been a violation of article of the convention under its procedural limb ii alleged violation of article of the convention relying on article of the convention the applicant complained that she had been prevented by force from exercising her right to freedom of expression the court notes that regarding the applicants allegations under this head the government were asked to respond to a question put under both articles and of the convention however given that the applicant did not claim to be a member of tayad and stated that she had distributed the leaflets as they reflected her opinions the court considers that this part of the application should be examined from the standpoint of article of the convention alone article of the convention reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested the applicants argument a admissibility the court notes that this part of the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions the applicant complained that the police intervention while she was distributing leaflets reflecting her opinions had constituted a breach of her right to freedom of expression the government replied that the police had approached the applicant and her friends in order to learn about the content of the leaflets and check their identities as they had resisted the security officers had had to arrest them according to the government neither the applicants arrest nor the case brought against her was on account of the distribution of leaflets they therefore concluded that there had not been a violation of article the courts assessmenta whether there was interference the court notes at the outset that it is disputed between the parties whether there was an interference with the applicants freedom of expression the applicant alleged that the police intervention in the distribution of the leaflets had constituted an interference with her right to freedom of expression whereas according to the government the applicant and her friends were arrested as they failed to comply with the police officers request to show them the content of the leaflets and their identity cards the government noted that the applicant had not been put on trial on account of the content of the leaflets the court reiterates that it has previously held that the arrest and detention of protesters may constitute an interference with the right to freedom of expression see chorherr v austria august series a no b lucas v the united kingdom dec no march and açık and others v turkey no january the court further recalls that in its judgment in the case of fatma akaltun fırat v turkey no and september it held that the police intervention in the distribution of leaflets published by a trade union and the detention of the applicant who was a member of the trade union in question had prevented her from imparting information published by her trade union and thus constituted an interference with her rights under article of the convention in the present case the court observes that although the applicant was not the author of the leaflets in question she participated in their dissemination by distributing them and thereby exercised her right to impart information and opinions see andrushko v russia no october regarding the question as to whether the police intervention constituted an interference with the applicants right under article the court sees no reason to depart from its considerations in the aforementioned judgments and decision whatever the reason given for the intervention of the police and the applicants arrest both measures prevented her from expressing her opinions and disseminating information and therefore constituted interference with her rights guaranteed under article of the convention in the courts view the absence of criminal proceedings against the applicant on account of the content of the leaflets does not alter the fact that there was an interference with her right to freedom of expressionb whether the interference was justified the court reiterates that any interference will constitute a breach of article of the convention unless it is prescribed by law pursues one or more legitimate aims under paragraph of that provision and is necessary in a democratic society for the achievement of those aims see among many other authorities ahmet yıldırım v turkey no echr the court further reiterates that the expression prescribed by law within the meaning of article requires firstly that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law however it also refers to the quality of the law in question requiring that it should be accessible to the person concerned who must moreover be able to foresee its consequences and that it should be compatible with the rule of law see among many other authorities dink v turkey nos and september according to the courts established caselaw a rule is foreseeable if it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable any individual if need be with appropriate advice to regulate his conduct see among many other authorities ahmet yıldırım v turkey cited above turning to the circumstance of the case the court notes that the government contended that the police officers had intended to obtain information regarding the content of the leaflets when they approached the applicant and her friends having regard to sections and of law no and section e of regulation no in force at the material time authorising the police to search individuals and to require them to present their identity documents in order to prevent commission of crimes or to apprehend perpetrators of crime subject to certain conditions see paragraphs and above and in the absence of a finding of unlawfulness of the police intervention and the applicants subsequent arrest in the domestic proceedings see paragraphs and above the court is prepared to accept that the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression was prescribed by law the court is further of the opinion that the national authorities may be considered to have pursued the legitimate aim of preventing disorder or crime in the present case what is in issue is whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society the court reiterates that in carrying out its scrutiny of the impugned interference the court must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see morice v france gc no april in the present case it is clear from the documents in the case file that as soon as the police received information according to which tayad members were distributing leaflets in a residential area a number of police officers arrived at the scene of incident the subsequent sequence of events was disputed between the arrestees including the applicant and the police officers before the judicial authorities in their decisions the kars criminal court the kars public prosecutor and the ardahan assize court considered the police officers version of the facts to be accurate and held that the applicant and her friends had resisted and insulted the police officers had refused to show their identity cards and the leaflets and had injured a police officer by way of hitting him with their bags see paragraphs and above at the end of the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant the kars criminal court convicted the applicant of obstructing the police officers in the execution of their duties and insulting them the court notes that the police have a general obligation to protect public order and to prevent crime and are also authorised to carry out identity checks pursuant to the domestic legislation see paragraphs and above in this connection the court observes that the judicial authorities in particular the kars criminal court considered that the applicant and her friends had been required to present their identity cards and the leaflets to the police when asked and their failure to do so had led to a legitimate intervention by the security forces the court reiterates that the domestic authorities are better placed to examine and interpret the facts see florian goldstein and sc ring press srl v romania dec no april and to apply the national legislation given that the judicial authorities in the present case provided an acceptable assessment of the facts the court does not see any reason to depart from their findings thus it finds that by not having complied with the lawful instructions of the police officers and having resisted the security forces the applicant and her friends were themselves responsible for their arrest in other words the applicant was not arrested for having distributed leaflets or because of the content of the leaflets distributed but she was arrested as a consequence of her behaviour towards the police officers as a result the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression should be regarded as an incidental effect of the police operation and thus as a measure proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued in sum the court finds that both the grounds for the police intervention noted in the arrest report of october and the content of the decisions of the judicial authorities which had the opportunity to review the acts and decisions of the security forces provided relevant and sufficient reasons to justify the interference with the applicants freedom of expression the interference in question was therefore necessary in a democratic society there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention iii alleged violations of article of the convention the applicant complained that she had been deprived of her liberty unlawfully and in breach of article of the convention she further complained under article of the convention that she had not been informed of the reasons for her arrest the government contested those arguments the court reiterates that according to its established caselaw where no remedies are available or if they are judged to be ineffective the sixmonth timelimit in principle runs from the date of the act alleged to constitute a violation of the convention however where it concerns a continuing situation the period of six months runs from the end of the situation concerned see ege v turkey dec no february and narin v turkey no december in this connection the court observes that the applicant did not submit these claims to the national authorities in particular in their submissions to the kars public prosecutor of november and those to the kars assize court the applicant and her lawyer complained about the alleged illtreatment of the applicant and the alleged infringement of her right to freedom of expression they did not make any submissions as to the alleged unlawfulness of the applicants detention nor did the applicant lodge an action for compensation for the alleged unlawfulness pursuant to article of the code on criminal procedure in the circumstances of the case the court is led to conclude that the applicants passivity in bringing her complaints under article to the attention of the domestic authorities was due to her consideration that these domestic remedies were ineffective in these circumstances and in the light of the aforementioned caselaw the court considers that the applicant should have lodged these complaints within six months following the end of her detention in police custody as the applicants detention ended on october and the application was lodged on july the court finds that these complaints were introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with article and of the convention iv application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court finds that there has been a violation of the convention or the protocols thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party the applicant did not submit a claim for just satisfaction accordingly the court considers that there is no call to award her any sum on that account for these reasons the court declares unanimously the complaints under articles and of the convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible holds unanimously that there has been no violation of article of the convention under its substantive aspect holds unanimously that there has been a violation of article of the convention under its procedural aspect holds by four votes to three that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on october pursuant to rule and of the rules of court stanley naismith andrás sajóregistrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgmenta concurring opinion of judge kjølbrob partly dissenting opinion of judges sajo keller and kuris asshnconcurring opinion of judge kjølbro i do not share the views expressed in paragraph and of the judgment in which the court is criticizing the medical report issued in respect of the applicant medical reports are very important in cases concerning alleged illtreatment in violation of article of the convention medical examination of persons held in police custody serves as a guarantee against illtreatment and an effective means to secure evidence and thereby secure accountability for illtreatment it is also important that medical examinations are performed by independent doctors and that the examination is thorough and in conformity with good practice for doctors in this context the standards recommended by the cpt and the guidelines set out in the istanbul protocol as also recognized in the courts caselaw are very important see the cases cited in paragraphs and of the judgment however it does not follow from this that any medical examination that does not fully meet all the standards recommended by the cpt and the istanbul protocol may be criticized by the court in cases concerning an alleged violation of article of the convention in other words the fact that a medical report does not mentioning explanations given by the patient as to how the injuries occurred and the opinion of the doctor as to whether the injuries are consistent with those explanations akkoç v turkey nos and echr x does not in itself justify criticizing the medical report in my view it must depend on the specific circumstances of the case whether the medical report can be criticized by the court either in the context of assessing whether the illtreatment has been proven beyond reasonable doubt the substantive limb of article or in the context of an assessment of the effectiveness of the investigation performed at domestic level the procedural limb of article on october shortly after am the applicant was arrested by police officers less than minutes later at am the applicant was examined by a doctor who described injuries observed paragraph of the judgment the sections in the medical report entitled conditions of examination information regarding the incident the complaints of the person examined and findings of the psychiatric examination were not completed paragraph of the judgment there is no information in the case to suggest that the applicant made any kind of complaints about illtreatment when she was examined by the doctor nor has the applicant in her complaint to the court alleged that she informed the doctor about the alleged illtreatment during her arrest furthermore when the applicant was questioned by the police at pm that is approximately ½ hours after the arrest she refused to make statements to the police paragraph of the judgment it was not until november more than a month after the arrest when the applicant was questioned by the public prosecutor as a suspect that she described the illtreatment and asked the public prosecutor to prosecute the police officers responsible see paragraph of the judgment under those circumstances i do not find any basis for criticizing the medical reports issued in my view it amounts to an excessive burden to require medical examinations to include without exception explanations given by the patient as to how the injuries occurred and the opinion of the doctor as to whether the injuries are consistent with those explanations this must in my view depend on the specific circumstances of the case including explanations given by or allegations made by the person arrested or the circumstances of the arrest therefore i respectfully distance myself from the criticism expressed by the court in paragraphs and of the judgment but apart from that i fully agree with the judgment of the court joint partly dissenting opinion of judges sajó keller and kūris to our regret we can not follow the majority in its finding that there has been no violation of article of the convention in the present case the government provided the following version of the facts the police received information according to which tayad members were distributing leaflets one of the officers approached the applicant and her friends told them that he was a police officer and requested to see the content of the leaflets and their identity cards as the applicant and her friends refused to comply and began using offensive language and hitting him a second police officer intervened this version of the facts is contradicted by the applicant the applicant was convicted of obstructing the police officers in the execution of their duties and insulting them the court found that the allegations of illtreatment had not been effectively investigated by the national authorities for this reason alone it is already questionable whether the intervention in the distribution was lawful but our disagreement raises a more fundamental issue we agree with the majority the interference with the applicants article right consists in the intervention of the police in the distribution and the applicants arrest nevertheless the majority is of the view that the applicant was punished for not showing her identity card and resisting the police order this matter is however immaterial with regard to the police interference with the distribution of the leaflets as the reasons for the arrest remain contested we will consider the first interference the fact that the police acting upon information received went to inquire about the distribution of the leaflets and asked for the identity cards of those distributing the leaflets in the absence of any information in the case file or detailed submissions by the respondent government demonstrating the legal basis for the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression we have serious doubts as to whether the police intervention and the applicants arrest were based on any statutory provisions we start from the assumption that this case originated in a targeted police action against the distribution of the leaflets see paragraph of the judgment it is of decisive importance that the police found it to be a matter of police concern that tayad members were distributing leaflets although neither the organisation on whose behalf the leaflets were distributed nor the leaflets themselves were illegal this court has already dealt with action by the turkish authorities directed against tayad members distributing leaflets and has found such interference to be in violation of article of the convention see kara v turkey no september for police action at a demonstration involving tayad which resulted in a violation of article under both its procedural and its substantive aspects as well as a violation of article see özalp ulusoy v turkey no june true in many legal systems there is a requirement to show identity cards at the request of the police and the police are entitled to ask for such identification in situations determined by the law it goes without saying that these provisions must be applied in a reasonable manner if the police could disperse any demonstration by means of systematic identity checks of the demonstrators this would amount to the end of freedom of expression in public space the majority following the governments argument considered the interest in public order and the prevention of crime to constitute sufficient grounds for the police intervention this approach is in our view too broad because it gives the police carte blanche when it comes to identity checks we start from the selfevident maxim that under the rule of law the police are also required to respect fundamental human rights including freedom of expression according to the caselaw of this court interference with the exercise of a fundamental human right in the abstract name of public order without consideration of the necessity of such interference in a democratic society amounts to a violation of article of the convention we are concerned that in the present case this standard requirement of the courts caselaw was put aside having regard to the lessons of history we are particularly concerned about the chilling effect of similar police practices state authorities may compile lists of people participating in demonstrations andor distributing leaflets or other materials which are officially not considered prohibited and use this personal information in different contexts against these people or those allegedly associated with them thus it is understandable that people exercising their freedom of expression by distributing leaflets especially where these criticise the government are afraid of disclosing their identity the above is a fundamental consideration for the effective protection of freedom of expression especially in the given circumstances see kara cited above it is unfortunate that the crucial restriction which the targeted police action entailed was obfuscated by legal formalities and the alleged disobedience of police orders a situation that emerged because of the disregard by the police of the applicants freedom to distribute leaflets the only reason why the police requested the identity cards of the applicant and her friends was the fact that the leaflets were being distributed by persons whom the police suspected to be tayad members or supporters in our opinion this seemingly minor incident disguised as the neutral application of a neutral law in a simple situation deserves the utmost attention by the court because the exercise of a fundamental freedom can not exist without the authorities showing the necessary respect and tolerance compare and contrast éva molnár v hungary no october the court must always be vigilant in ensuring that states not only safeguard the right to distribute leaflets as a manifestation of the freedom of expression protected by article of the convention but also refrain from imposing unreasonable indirect restrictions on that right the essential aim of article and article of the convention is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the exercise of the rights protected see mutatis mutandis oya ataman v turkey no december with this judgment that aim has been dismissed,,,
49,in and lives in kværndrup he was represented by mr jonas christoffersen a lawyer practising in copenhagen the danish government the government were represented by their agent mr michael braad from the ministry of foreign affairs and their co agent ms nina holst christensen from the ministry of justice the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows the applicant worked as a physician until around he founded an association called physicians in favour of euthanasia læger for aktiv dødshjælp for physicians aiming to have euthanasia made lawful in denmark in pursuance of this aim the applicant prepared a guide medicines suited for suicide lægemidler der er velegnede til selvmord available on the internet the guide combined a detailed procedure for how to commit suicide including a list of about common pharmaceuticals suited to committing suicide and a description of the dose required to go through with the suicide possible combinations of pharmaceuticals and caveats about the various pharmaceuticals the guide also provided advice on how a person could be assured of death by taking the recommended doses of medicines including by combining different pharmaceuticals or by taking a full dose of a pharmaceutical in combination with a plastic bag over the head and a rubber band around the neck it was lawful under danish law to publish such a guide on the internet or elsewhere on the basis of a radio interview with the applicant in february in which he stated inter alia that he had assisted a patient with a terminal pulmonary condition in dying by administering the pharmaceutical fenemal the patient safety authority styrelsen for patientsikkerhed reported the applicant to the police for violation of section of the penal code prohibiting assisted suicide moreover on march it withdrew the applicants doctors licence to practise with the consequence among other things that the applicant could no longer prescribe medications for himself or others subsequently the applicant was charged with two counts of assisted suicide and one count of attempt by a judgment of september the district court of svendborg retten i svendborg convicted the applicant of one count of assisted suicide and one count of attempt he was sentenced to days imprisonment suspended on appeal to the high court of eastern denmark østre landsret by a judgment of january the applicant was convicted of all three counts and sentenced to days imprisonment suspended on appeal to the supreme court højesteret on september the high court judgment was upheld more concretely in respect of count the applicant was convicted of attempted assisted suicide committed on march having together with a codefendant prescribed medications for a who wanted to commit suicide the suicide attempt had failed the applicant stated that a had contacted him and told him that he suffered from neurological diseases the applicant had spoken to a several times on the telephone and they had also communicated by email the applicant had asked the codefendant to prescribe fenemal for a the applicant had known that a would use the medication to commit suicide the codefendant confirmed the correctness of this statement and explained that he had been contacted by the applicant who had asked him to prescribe fenemal for a as the applicant could not prescribe any medications himself because his doctors licence to practise had been withdrawn a confirmed that he had been in contact with the applicant who had helped him obtain the required medication since his attempted suicide a had received medications for his physical pain and his anxiety and his condition had therefore improved in respect of count the applicant was convicted of assisted suicide committed in the spring of having prior to bs death dispensed a dose of fenemal to him knowing full well that it was intended for his suicide b had become paralysed in most of his body following a stroke he no longer found life worth living and wanted to die the applicant stated that he had visited b and advised him how to commit suicide in accordance with the guide that he had uploaded to the internet subsequently he had discussed with another person whether it was possible to procure pills for b but he did not know whether that person had ever supplied the pills the applicant had not himself provided any medication for b according to the statement given by bs former wife b had tried to be allowed to go to switzerland for euthanasia however no psychiatrists would issue a medical certificate saying that b was mentally prepared as required by the swiss authorities bs former wife had then contacted the applicant asking him to help b they had met with the applicant who had indicated that he could establish contact with someone who could procure the medication subsequently bs former wife had received a supply for b which she handed over to b who had later stated that he now had what he needed in may the family had had a farewell dinner with b and the next day bs former wife had received a telephone call from the nursing home and been told that b was fast asleep and that it was not possible to waken him up b had passed away a couple of days later in respect of count the applicant was convicted of assisted suicide committed between july and august c was years old she suffered from many infirmities but was not seriously ill she wished to end her life and had procured the necessary pills herself on july she had contacted the applicant by email and asked for his assistance the applicant and c had exchanged at least nine emails between july and august on july the applicant had asked c which medication she had procured on july the applicant had confirmed that the medications at her disposal were excellent and also recommended that she look at the general guide on how to commit suicide which was available on the website of the network on july he was helping her finding the general guide on august he confirmed that it was a good idea to combine the medication with a plastic bag over her head in which connection he had written if you are able to go through with it you will be certain remember in that case that it is necessary to put a rubber band around the neck on august c had been found dead in her bed with a plastic bag over her head in its judgment of september the supreme court stated liability for assisted suicide or attempts at assisted suicide by the high court judgment the applicant was found guilty on two counts of violation of section of the penal code for assisted suicide and one count of an attempt at assisted suicide this case concerns whether according to the findings of fact of the high court the acts performed by the applicant as described in the three counts are punishable because they are considered assistance as set out in the provision and whether the conditions for imposing a sentence for the attempt have been met in that case there is also the issue of the length of the sentence it is a punishable offence under section of the penal code to assist another person in ending his or her life but it is not a punishable offence to attempt to take ones own life accordingly this provision independently criminalises assisted suicide the supreme court finds that it will be determined based on an interpretation of this provision what kinds of assistance fall within the scope of the liability for which reason it is not possible simply to use as a basis those kinds of complicity that are punishable under the general rule of law set out in section of the penal code as complicity in offences minor assistance may fall outside the scope of criminal offences under section as regards count the applicant has been found guilty of violation of section of the penal code because he procured medications for b prior to bs death on may knowing full well that the medications were intended for his suicide as regards count the applicant has been found guilty of attempted violation of section because he procured medications for a knowing full well that the medications were intended for as suicide which suicide failed however the supreme court concurs in the finding that the applicants acts as described in count and count are punishable as assisted suicide as set out in section of the penal code as regards count the supreme court concurs in the finding that the conditions for sentencing someone for an attempt have been met as the maximum penalty under section of a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years makes it possible to sanction attempts see section of the penal code the applicants submission concerning the legislative history of section can not lead to a different conclusion as regards count the applicant has been found guilty of having in emails exchanged with c advised her about suicide methods including by confirming the choice of medications and by confirming that it was a good idea to combine them with a plastic bag and by writing if you are able to go through with it you will be certain remember in that case that it is necessary to put a rubber band around the neck thereby he assisted her in committing suicide by taking medicines and putting a plastic bag over her head and closing it with a rubber band opinion of three judges concerning count we concur in the finding that by giving advice in his email exchange with c the applicant assisted her in a specific and significant way in committing suicide and that the advice is not exempt from punishment due to the circumstance that his advice was based on a general guide that had lawfully been uploaded to the website of physicians in favour of euthanasia in this context we have also taken into account that the specific advice offered by the applicant to c was suited to a greater extent than the general guide to intensifying her desire to commit suicide in our opinion there is no basis for finding that it would be contrary to article of the european convention on human rights to convict the defendant on this count opinion of two judges concerning count it appears from the case file that c contacted the applicant in july and indicated in her emails that she was years old and suffered from many infirmities that she wished to end soon and that things had been clarified with her close family she had procured the necessary pills and her intention was also to combine them with a plastic bag she was very frightened of the potential risk that she would fail and she was nervous as to whether she would be able to go through with it on her own the applicant then passed on information from the lawful guide on the website but he did not pass on any information not already available from the website he neither advocated nor encouraged her to commit suicide in these circumstances we find that the information given by the applicant to c was not of such a nature that the information can independently be considered to constitute a punishable act of assistance in her ending her life accordingly we find that the applicant must be acquitted on this count of violation of section of the penal code which must also be considered to accord best with article of the european convention on human rights on the right to receive and give information see in this respect the judgment delivered on october by the european court of human rights in cases and open door and dublin well woman v ireland the supreme court by a majority of three judges sentenced the applicant to days imprisonment suspended it was taken into account as an aggravating circumstance that to a certain extent the acts were committed in a systematic manner and that the applicant had been charged on three counts the last act being committed after he had been provisionally charged by the police for violation of section of the penal code it was considered a mitigating circumstance that the applicant was almost years old the minority of two judges found that the applicant should have a suspended sentence of imprisonment for a term of days since count was merely an attempt and under count he had not assisted to a significant extent moreover the minority of the judges found that the acts had not been committed in a systematic manner relevant legal framework and practice the relevant provisions of the penal code straffeloven read as follows section acts aimed at inciting or assisting the commission of an offence are punishable as attempts if the offence is not completed the penalty prescribed for an offence may be reduced for attempts especially where an attempt reflects little strength or persistence of criminal intent unless otherwise provided attempts will only be punished if the offence is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding four months section the penalty provided for an offence applies to everybody who is complicit in the act by incitement aiding or abetting the punishment may be reduced where a person intended only to provide minor assistance or support an intent already formed and where the offence has not been completed or intentional complicity failed the punishment may also be reduced where a person is complicit in the breach of a special duty to which he is not subject unless otherwise provided the punishment for complicity in offences that do not carry a sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding four months may be remitted where the accomplice intended only to provide minor assistance or support an intent already formed and where his complicity was due to negligence section any person who kills another at such other persons explicit request is sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years section any person who assists someone in deliberately ending his life is sentenced to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years assisted suicide has been criminalised since section of the penal code was given its current wording by act no of march in november the ministry of justice requested the standing committee on the criminal code straffelovrådet which is an advisory body tasked with making recommendations on legislative issues related to criminal law issues of principle relating to the stipulation of administrative criminal law provisions and the implementation in practice of crime policy measures to consider the issue of whether to criminalise also general encouragement of suicide or suicide recipes not aimed at specific persons in its report no the said committee did not recommend the criminalisation of general encouragement to suicide in respect of the scope of section of the penal code it stated as follows it is not a punishable offence to attempt to take ones own life but it is a punishable offence under section of the penal code to assist another person in ending his or her life the maximum sentence is a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years the offence is consummated when the victim dies depending on the circumstances it is possible to sentence a person for an attempt at assisting another person in ending his or her life see section read with section of the penal code attempts comprise any act aimed at inciting or assisting in the commission of an offence see pp ff of the annotated criminal code den kommenterede straffelov on general rules the question is whether section only applies to physical and mental assistance of a qualified nature or whether in accordance with the general danish law rule on complicity set out in section of the penal code the provision also applies if the offender by incitement aiding or abetting deliberately assists a particular person in committing suicide see pp ff on general rules and p on special rules of the annotated criminal code for an act to be punishable under section it is required in any circumstances that the offender must have performed a specific act of assistance with the intent that one or more specific persons commit suicide encouragement of suicide and descriptions of methods to commit suicide do not fall within the scope of section if not directed at specific persons therefore the presentation or dissemination of suicide recipes through internet websites or the like can not normally be punished under section as mentioned above a person can be sentenced for assistance under section of the criminal code only if the purpose of the offence of assistance is a specific act of assistance the issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide has regularly been the subject of public and political debate in denmark but so far there has not been a political majority in parliament in favour of amending section of the penal code the issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide has also been considered by the council of ethics det etiske råd the council of ethics is an independent body established in to advise parliament ministers and public authorities on ethical issues in health care while respecting the integrity and dignity of humans and future generations in and the council of ethics published reports and recommendations on euthanasia and assisted suicide a large majority of the seventeen members of the council was against the legalisation of euthanasia and assisted suicide in all three reports the council has balanced the considerations on the one hand factors like the right to personal autonomy and on the other hand factors like the sanctity of human life as a fundamental ethical standard and the incompatibility of euthanasia with an ethically appropriate relationship between a physician and a patient the danish council of ethics discussed the subject again in on the basis of a judgment delivered by the german federal constitutional court in february which had ruled that the maintenance of a prohibition of assisted suicide was unconstitutional in parliament amended the danish health care act sundhedsloven enhancing patients right to refuse treatment including lifesustaining treatment which means that a patient who has come to terms with circumstances and does not want any lifesustaining treatment can refuse the treatment offered even though the consequence of withdrawing from lifesustaining treatment is that the patient will die right away moreover a system of living wills has been set up under which individuals can make binding advance decisions to refuse lifesustaining treatment in specific situations that may occur some time in the future if they become permanently incompetent and are no longer able to exercise their right to personal autonomy prior to the adoption of the amendment bill it was discussed at the readings in parliament what is a dignified death and what is the right to personal autonomy and it was discussed that it must be ensured that health care professionals can discontinue lifesustaining treatment without fearing being charged with homicide on request finally in december all parties in parliament concluded a political agreement to roll out an it system that was to support a future right of elderly feeble citizens to ask their physician to write a donotresuscitate order in the event that they suffer from heart failure it is expected that a bill granting this right will be introduced in relevant international and european materials recommendation of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe recommended inter alia as follows paragraph that the committee of ministers encourage the member states of the council of europe to respect and protect the dignity of terminally ill or dying persons in all respectsc by upholding the prohibition against intentionally taking the life of terminally ill or dying persons whilei recognising that the right to life especially with regard to a terminally ill or dying person is guaranteed by the member states in accordance with article of the european convention on human rights which states that no one shall be deprived of his life intentionallyii recognising that a terminally ill or dying persons wish to die never constitutes any legal claim to die at the hand of another personiii recognising that a terminally ill or dying persons wish to die can not of itself constitute a legal justification to carry out actions intended to bring about death comparative law in a comparative research in respect of fortytwo council of europe member states see koch v germany no july showed that in thirtysix countries albania andorra austria azerbaijan bosnia and herzegovina bulgaria croatia cyprus the czech republic denmark estonia france georgia greece hungary ireland latvia lithuania the former yugoslav republic of macedonia malta moldova monaco montenegro norway poland portugal romania russia san marino spain serbia slovakia slovenia turkey ukraine and the united kingdom any form of assistance to suicide was strictly prohibited and criminalised by law in sweden and estonia assistance to suicide was not a criminal offence however estonian medical practitioners were not entitled to prescribe a drug in order to facilitate suicide conversely only four member states switzerland belgium the netherlands and luxembourg allowed medical practitioners to prescribe lethal drugs subject to specific safeguards the government have submitted the following information about the current legislation in member states including denmark norway sweden france the united kingdom turkey bulgaria iceland ireland portugal spain luxembourg belgium switzerland germany italy austria estonia the netherlands and finland euthanasia is allowed in a number of countries under certain specified conditions including spain the netherlands luxembourg and belgium in spain following the recent adoption of an act to this effect it is now possible for patients suffering from a serious and incurable disease or a serious chronic and disabling disorder causing unbearable suffering to request that health care professionals administer euthanasia it is further required that an assessment must be performed by at least two external experts appointed by a regional evaluation commission other than the cases that have now been made lawful all active contributions to or coordination of actions necessary to cause another persons death are criminalised in spain the netherlands have criminalised euthanasia and assisted suicide physicians are however exempt from prosecution if six criteria have been met including that the patient endures unbearable suffering without any prospect of improvement that the patient has been examined by at least one external physician and that the euthanasia is performed in accordance with the existing health care guidelines in luxembourg and belgium euthanasia is also lawful under certain conditions including that the patients health problems are incurable and the patient suffers from unbearable physicalmental pain that the patient must have had a number of consultations with his or her physician on the subject and that the physician must have consulted another physician as well as a close relative of the patient appointed by the patient in portugal euthanasia continues to be criminalised but in january the portuguese parliament adopted a bill intended to make euthanasia and physicianassisted suicide lawful for terminally ill and wounded persons however the portuguese constitutional court quashed the bill because it found it too unspecific the ruling party has now introduced a revised bill which takes into account the criticism raised by the constitutional court if the bill is adopted by parliament the president may submit the bill to the constitutional court for review as part of the enactment process in a number of countries euthanasia is criminalised whereas assisted suicide is lawful in certain circumstances those countries are sweden switzerland germany italy austria estonia and finland assisted suicide is not criminalised in sweden but the swedish parliament recently adopted an amending act making it a punishable act in certain circumstances to encourage or otherwise exert influence on another person to take his or her own life in pursuance of this amending act any person who incites or otherwise exerts influence on another person to take his or her own life is punished for encouragement of suicide or negligent incitement to suicide this could be to introduce a suicidal person to a razor blade or to give detailed instructions to a person about a particular method of committing suicide for example by sending him or her a socalled suicide manual the exchange of general information on suicide issues has not been criminalised in switzerland assisted suicide is lawful and is offered by various organisations however assisted suicide is punished by imprisonment or a pecuniary penalty if the person assisting in the suicide is motivated by selfserving ends in germany assisted suicide has been decriminalised as a consequence of a judgment of the federal constitutional court similarly assisted suicide has been decriminalised in austria since december as a consequence of a decision made by the constitutional court of austria in italy both euthanasia and assisted suicide are criminalised however the case law of the italian constitutional court has opened up for an exception in connection with lifesustaining treatment of an incurable disease under certain specified conditions including if the person is kept alive by the treatment of vital functions while suffering from an incurable disease that causes unbearable physical or mental pain and if a public national health authority has granted an approval following consultation of the local committee on ethics both euthanasia and assisted suicide are criminalised in denmark norway france iceland bulgaria and turkey however in denmark and norway the distribution of general information on suicide methods is not criminalised in france the sanction for all kinds of propaganda for andor marketing of products or methods that are recommended as means to commit suicide is imprisonment for a term of three years and a fine in the amount of eur in the united kingdom a bill on assisted dying was examined by the house of lords on october allowing adults diagnosed with a terminal illness under certain circumstances to submit an application for assisted dying to the high court general information on suicide for example on a website may lead to the imposition of a sentence in ireland both euthanasia and assisted suicide are criminalised but a bill has been introduced in the lower house of the irish parliament to legalise voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide for terminally ill persons the bill is currently being considered by the irish committee on legal affairs which has recommended that a specific committee be set up to draft the bill considering the serious nature of the subject the distribution of general information on suicide methods is not criminalised in ireland the law the applicant complained that the supreme courts judgment of september breached his right to freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the court notes that the application is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merits parties arguments the applicant submitted inter alia that the case concerned on the one hand the general right to receive information on assisted suicide a matter in which the governments previous wide margin of appreciation should now be decreased due the growing legalisation of assisted suicide in europe and the increasing shift in public opinion on this subject on the other hand the case concerned the applicants right to freedom of expression in essence the applicant had been convicted for orally providing individuals with information which he could legally provide in writing to the general public in his guide on suicide he referred to the finding of the minority of the supreme court in respect of count such an interference with his right to freedom of expression which did not relate to the actual subject of the expression or information but rather to how and to whom it was provided could not be considered proportionate the government pointed out inter alia that encouragement of suicide and descriptions of methods to commit suicide fell outside the scope of section of the penal code if it was not directed at specific persons however it was punishable under the said provision if the offender performed a specific act of assistance with the intent that an individual commit suicide thus the guide to commit suicide prepared by the applicant was legal whereas it was illegal for him to provide specific advice to particular persons on how they could commit suicide in addition under counts and the supreme court had unanimously found that besides having given specific advice the applicant had also performed specific acts by prescribing or procuring via others the medication necessary for the relevant persons to commit suicide in the governments view the court should take into account that the case concerned difficult ethical and moral issues on which there was no consensus among the member states moreover the current state of the law expressed the legislatures deliberate choice after regular review most recently in furthermore the national courts had thoroughly reviewed the compatibility of the interference with the convention in accordance with the guidelines given by the court in its caselaw for which reason states parties should be allowed a wide margin of appreciation in determining whether assisted suicide should be allowed under national law ordo iuris institute for legal culture submitted observations on among other things assisted suicide laws in europe and international professional standards regarding physicianassisted suicide the courts assessmenta applicable principles the general principles regarding the right to freedom of expression within the meaning of article of the convention are wellsettled in the courts caselaw and summarised for example in perinçek v switzerland gc no and echr extracts moreover it is established caselaw that the national authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in matters of morals particularly in an area such as the present which touches on matters of belief concerning the nature of human life see among others open door and dublin well woman v ireland october series a no a in addition the quality of the parliamentary and judicial review of the necessity of a general measure such as in the present case the criminalisation of assisted suicide is of particular importance including to the operation of the relevant margin of appreciation see among others animal defenders international v the united kingdom gc no echr extracts correia de matos v portugal gc no and april and ma v denmark gc no july a further factor which has an impact on the scope of the margin of appreciation is the existence or not of common ground between the national laws of the contracting states see among others parrillo v italy gc no echr and ma v denmark cited above finally the courts fundamentally subsidiary role in the convention protection system has an impact on the scope of the margin of appreciation the contracting parties in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity have the primary responsibility to secure the rights and freedoms defined in the convention and the protocols thereto and in doing so they enjoy a margin of appreciation subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the court through their democratic legitimation the national authorities are as the court has held on many occasions in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions see inter alia lekić v slovenia gc no december see also protocol no which entered into force on august b application of these principles to the present casei prescribed by law and legitimate aim it is not in dispute between the parties that the applicants conviction constituted an interference prescribed by law namely section of the penal code which pursued the legitimate aims of the protection of health and morals and the rights of others the court notes that regarding counts and the applicant was convicted not only for having provided guidance but also for having by specific acts procured medications for the persons concerned see paragraphs and above the court therefore finds reason to doubt whether in respect of these counts there was indeed an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression within the meaning of article nevertheless in the following it will proceed on the assumption that there wasii necessity in a democratic society assisted suicide has been criminalised in the danish legislation since the current wording of section of the penal code is from for an act to be punishable under section it is required that the offender must have performed a specific act of assistance with the intent that one or more specific persons commit suicide encouragement of suicide and descriptions of methods of committing suicide do not fall within the scope of section if not directed at specific persons therefore the presentation or dissemination of suicide recipes through internet websites or the like can not normally be punished under section see paragraph above in the present case the court is not required to determine whether the criminalisation of assisted suicide is justified under the courts well established caselaw in proceedings originating in an individual application under article of the convention its task is not to review domestic law in abstracto instead it must determine whether the manner in which it was applied to or affected the applicant gave rise to a violation of the convention it can thus only review whether or not the application of section of the penal code in the case of the applicant was necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention see inter alia perinçek v switzerland cited above the answer to the question whether such a necessity exists depends on the need to protect the health and morals and the rights of others in issue by way of criminal law measures turning first to its caselaw the court found in haas v switzerland no echr that article of the convention which creates for the authorities a duty to protect vulnerable persons even against actions by which they endanger their own lives also obliges the national authorities to prevent an individual from taking his or her own life if the decision has not been taken freely and with full understanding of what is involved in koch v germany no july and the references cited therein the court acknowledged that an individuals right to decide in which way and at which time his or her life should end provided that he or she was in a position freely to form his or her own will and to act accordingly was one of the aspects of the right to respect for private life within the meaning of article of the convention moreover in gross v switzerland no may the court considered that the applicants wish to be provided with a dose of sodium pentobarbital allowing her to end her life fell within the scope of her right to respect for her private life under article of the convention it will be recalled that the case was referred to the grand chamber which on september declared it inadmissible for abuse of the right of application within the meaning of article a of the convention there is no support in the courts caselaw however for concluding that a right to assisted suicide exists under the convention including in the form of providing information about or assistance that goes beyond providing general information about suicide compare under article pretty v the united kingdom no echr iii accordingly as the applicant was not prosecuted for providing general information about suicide including the guide on suicide that had been made publicly available but was prosecuted for having assisted suicide through specific acts the court finds that the present case is not about the applicants right to provide information that others under the convention had a right to receive before the supreme court the applicant submitted that he had only assisted a b and c by providing guidance and information which was already legally accessible on the internet and which failed to reach the threshold under section of the penal code he relied specifically on article of the convention as regards counts and the supreme court found unanimously that the applicant had not only provided guidance but had also by specific acts procured medications for the persons concerned in the knowledge that it was intended for their suicide such acts were clearly covered by section of the penal code and implicitly did not give rise to an issue under article as regards count it was found established that the applicant in emails exchanged with c had advised her about suicide methods including by confirming the choice of medications and by confirming that it was a good idea to combine them with a plastic bag and by writing if you are able to go through with it you will be certain remember in that case that it is necessary to put a rubber band around the neck on the basis of an interpretation of section in the light notably of the preparatory works the legislative review including report no by the standing committee on the penal code see paragraph above and the convention the majority of the supreme court found the applicant guilty under the said provision in that he had assisted c in a specific and significant way in committing suicide that his advice was not exempted from punishment because it was based on his lawful general guide on the website of physicians in favour of euthanasia that his specific advice was suited to a greater extent than the general guide to intensifying cs desire to commit suicide and that his conviction would not be in breach of article of the convention the applicant was given a suspended sentence of days imprisonment it was taken into account as an aggravating circumstance that to a certain extent the acts had been committed in a systematic manner and that the applicant had been charged on three counts the last act being committed after he had been provisionally charged by the police for violation of section of the penal code it was considered a mitigating circumstance that the applicant was almost years old the court sees no reason to call into question the supreme courts conclusions it notes that a crucial question was the distinction to be drawn between the legal general guide available on the internet and the specific information provided by the applicant to c the majority found that the specific information provided by the applicant was based on the general guide see paragraphs and above and it does not appear that he added any information which did not follow from the general guide however the majority also found that the applicants specific advice was suited to a greater extent than the general guide to intensifying cs desire to commit suicide the court notes in this respect that c in her first email of july to the applicant had asked for his assistance although she had already procured the necessary medication herself and was aware of the existence of the general guide on the internet moreover the applicant and c exchanged at least nine emails in the period from july to august thus during a period of approximately three weeks in these circumstances the court considers that the reasons relied on by the supreme court when finding that the act fell within the scope of section of the penal code were relevant and sufficient the court also notes that the supreme court made a thorough judicial review of the applicable law in the light of the convention including the courts judgment in open door and dublin well woman v ireland cited above about a restriction of an absolute nature on the provision of information to pregnant women concerning abortion facilities abroad regardless of age or state of health or their reasons for seeking counselling on the termination of pregnancy the interference concerned services which were lawful in other countries and which could be crucial to a womans health and wellbeing ibid on that ground alone the court found that it appeared overbroad and disproportionate ibid in addition the counsellors neither advocated nor encouraged abortion but confined themselves to an explanation of available options in the present case it was undisputed that the applicant could legally publish his guide medicines suited for suicide on the internet and could encourage to suicide if not directed at specific persons the charges concerned the applicants concrete assistance or advice to three specific persons a b and c on how to commit suicide the restriction in section of the penal code was imposed in order to protect such persons health and wellbeing by preventing other persons from assisting in their suicide the case at hand thus differs significantly from open door and dublin well woman v ireland having regard to the above the court considers that the quality of the judicial review of the disputed general measure and its application in the present case militates in favour of a wide margin of appreciation the court notes that a criminal conviction is a serious sanction having regard to the existence of other means of intervention and rebuttal particularly through civil remedies see for example perinçek v switzerland cited above in the circumstances of the present case however the court does not find the conviction and the sentence excessive bearing also in mind that the sentence was suspended another element which speaks in favour of a wide margin of appreciation in the present case is the fact that the subject of assisted suicide concern matters of morals see paragraph above and that the comparative law research set out in paragraphs to above enables the court to conclude that the member states of the council of europe are far from having reached a consensus on this issue see paragraph above see also for example haas v switzerland cited above in the light of all the abovementioned considerations the court considers that the reasons relied upon by the domestic courts and most recently the supreme court in its judgment of september were both relevant and sufficient to establish that the interference complained of can be regarded as necessary in a democratic society proportionate to the aims pursued namely the protection of health and morals and the rights of others and that the authorities of the respondent state acted within their margin of appreciation having taken into account the criteria set out in the courts caselaw there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimouslydeclares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on april pursuant to rule and of the rules of court stanley naismith carlo ranzoni registrar president,,,
50,the applicant was born in and lives in toruń the applicant is a publicist and a professor of sociology a the statement in issue on january rzeczpospolita a national daily newspaper published an article titled zybertowicz so far to the third polish republic zybertowicz na razie dla iii rp the article contained information about three civil lawsuits against the applicant instituted by am the editorinchief of one of the biggest daily newspapers gazeta wyborcza and a certain ms and zs the article also included a comment by the applicant on the lawsuits in question in a way it is quite interesting to note who has lodged civil claims against me so far two agents and one their fierce defender swoją drogą to ciekawe kto mnie dotychczas pozwał do sądu dwóch agentów i jeden ich zaciekły obrońca b civil proceedings against the applicant on march am brought a civil action in the warsaw regional court sąd okręgowy requesting legal protection of his personal rights he asked that the applicant be ordered to publish an apology and to pay damages of polish zlotys pln approximately euros eur to a charity on april the warsaw regional court transferred the case to the toruń regional court on august the warsaw court of appeal sąd apelacyjny quashed this decision on june the warsaw regional court gave judgment and partly allowed the plaintiffs claim it ordered the applicant to publish an apology on the first second or third page of rzeczpospolita it further determined the exact size and wording of the apology the court also ordered the applicant to pay pln approximately eur to a charity and pln approximately eur in court fees during the proceedings the court questioned the applicant and the plaintiff the applicant argued that the phrase in question had represented his opinion about ams public statements referring to several published statements and excerpts from articles written by am the applicant claimed that he had had a good factual basis for giving this opinion of ams views about lustration the court also obtained an opinion from an expert on linguistics the expert was asked in particular to reply to the question of whether the phrase two agents and one their fierce defender in the context of the case constituted a statement of fact or an opinion in his opinion of may the expert stated that the phrase in question had been a statement of fact and not a hypothesis or supposition in addition taking into account the readers presumed general knowledge it was obvious that am had been identified in the article as having defended two agents the plaintiff submitted to the court a second expert report dated january in which another expert on language analysis confirmed that the applicants statement had been a statement of fact the warsaw regional court noted that the applicant when formulating the statement in question referred in particular to a number of published statements made by am in which he had criticised the lustration law the applicant also relied on an earlier warsaw court of appeal judgment confirming that zs had indeed collaborated under communism with the security service the court further held that everyone including those not following the news carefully was aware that ms and zs had been accused of collaborating with the security service in particular readers of rzeczpospolita should have been aware of that fact as the newspaper had published numerous articles on the issue the warsaw regional court also held that judging by both the applicants statement and the whole article it did not appear that am had been an agent while the applicant in his statement had not specified who in his opinion had been an agent and who their fierce defender from the nature of the publication and taking into account the readers general knowledge it was clear that it was the plaintiff who was considered to be the fierce defender of two agents at the same time the court accepted that had the applicant used a more general formulation and referred only to ams attitude towards the lustration law such words could have fallen within the limits of acceptable criticism and it would not have been necessary to protect ams personal rights lastly the court considered that from the published statements and quotes from ams public statements which the applicant had submitted during the proceedings it did not appear that am had ever actually defended those two particular persons in conclusion the court held that ams personal rights had been breached but only partially for this reason the court considered that the plaintiffs claim had been exaggerated therefore it lowered the sum to be paid to the charity both parties appealed on march the warsaw court of appeal modified the firstinstance judgment and ordered the applicant to pay pln approximately eur to the charity and pln approximately eur in court fees the applicant was also ordered to publish an apology in rzeczpospolita the court in principle agreed with the reasoning presented by the regional court it held that while the phrase fierce defender of two agents had breached ams personal rights it was not defamatory the court further agreed with the regional court that the applicant had named am as having defended two particular persons however he had failed to prove that his statement had been true consequently the court considered that the phrase used by the applicant had breached the plaintiffs personal rights in particular his good name and had conflicted with the values espoused by him the court referred to the ongoing public debate in poland about the necessity of lustration in order to explain and disclose the role of various special services after the world war ii it noted that in the context of that debate the phrase that someone was a fierce defender of agents suggested that that person had defended them justified their actions and searched for a way to absolve them from any responsibility in the eyes of the public consequently attributing to someone the role of fierce defender of agents was a breach of that persons good name and suggested that that persons behaviour had been contrary to the public good the court also held that the phrase in question had been a statement of fact however it considered that there had been no basis for concluding that am had defended any agents or more generally defended activities of the communist secret services that had been harmful to the public on the contrary he had firmly condemned such activities he had objected to lustration being understood as a tool to destroy people and being used as an argument in political games with reference to the sum to be paid to the charity the court noted that the applicant was a highly educated university professor holding numerous public offices a person in the applicants situation should have been aware of how his statement would have been understood by an average reader of rzeczpospolita and whether there was any basis for attributing to someone the role of fierce defender of agents the court further held that the sum of pln to be paid to charity was symbolic and that pln was a more appropriate sum given the circumstances of the case especially considering that it was not an excessive burden for the applicant the applicant lodged a cassation appeal in particular he referred to article of the convention on march the supreme court sąd najwyższy refused to entertain the applicants cassation appeal on account of the lack of important legal issues to be considered in the case the court relying on article of the convention noted that freedom of expression did not have an absolute character it further referred to its own caselaw according to which the necessity to prove that a statement of fact was true was not an excessive requirement and did not infringe the freedom of political debate c enforcement proceedings on april ams representative instituted enforcement proceedings in the warsaw district court aimed at compelling the applicant to comply with the obligations imposed by the warsaw court of appeals judgment of march on june the warsaw district court ordered the applicant to publish the apology ordered by the warsaw court of appeal in rzeczpospolita after the applicant failed to comply with that order on june the warsaw district court allowed am to publish the apology in rzeczpospolita in the applicants name and ordered him to cover the fee for its publication in the amount of pln approximately eur the applicant received a significant discount on that fee ii relevant domestic law and practice article of the civil code contains a nonexhaustive list of rights known as personal rights dobra osobiste this provision states the personal rights of an individual such as health liberty reputation cześć freedom of conscience name or pseudonym image secrecy of correspondence inviolability of the home scientific or artistic work and inventions and improvements shall be protected under civil law regardless of the degree of protection laid down in other legal provisions article of the civil code provides for ways of redressing infringements of personal rights under that provision a person faced with the threat of an infringement may demand that the prospective perpetrator refrain from the wrongful activity in question unless it is not unlawful where an infringement has taken place the person affected may inter alia request that the wrongdoer make an apology in an appropriate form or demand satisfaction from him or her if an infringement of personal rights causes financial loss the person concerned may seek damages under article of the civil code a person whose personal rights have been infringed may seek compensation that provision in its relevant part reads the court may grant a suitable sum as pecuniary compensation for nonpecuniary damage krzywda suffered by anyone whose personal rights have been infringed alternatively without prejudice to the right to seek any other relief that may be necessary to remove the consequences of the infringement the person concerned may ask the court to award a suitable sum for the benefit of a specific social interest the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention of a breach of his right to freedom of expression that article reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the applicants submissions the applicant submitted that the entire statement had been made in the course of a public debate and in connection with the discussion on lustration in his opinion the domestic courts had failed to make a distinction between factual statements and value judgments those of his statements that had allegedly infringed ams rights had been value judgments which had had a sufficient factual basis during the proceedings he had referred to numerous statements made by am and had insisted that his opinion had described ams position towards lustration in poland despite that the courts had relied on a very narrow reading of the phrase fierce defender of agents and had held that the impugned statement should have been understood as a factual statement in the applicants view this very formalistic approach on the part of the domestic courts had effectively deprived him of the protection afforded by article of the convention the applicant referred to the fact that the warsaw regional court had confirmed that some of ams statements might have constituted a sufficient basis for the applicant to use the expression fierce defender of agents nevertheless the court had refused to read the applicants statement in this way and had persisted with a narrow linguistic interpretation of the phrase taking all those elements into account the applicant considered that his statement had not overstepped the limits of the protection afforded to him by article of the convention the governments submissions the government submitted that the statement in question had concerned legal cases against the applicant and that therefore it had not formed part of an open discussion on matters of public concern since the applicant although a publicist had been acting as a private individual on this occasion they further considered that the domestic authorities rightly qualified the applicants statement as a statement of fact rather than as a value judgment yet the applicant had failed to prove the veracity of his allegations they further noted that freedom of expression could not justify making public statements that were untrue and which infringed the personal rights of others they concluded by saying that the domestic courts had provided detailed reasoning for their decisions furthermore the interference had not been disproportionate as the applicant had only been ordered to publish an apology and to pay pln to charity consequently the government invited the court to find no violation of article of the convention in the present case the courts assessmenta the general principles the general principles for assessing whether an interference with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention are well settled in the courts caselaw they were recently restated in pentikäinen v finland gc no echr and bédat v switzerland gc no march the court must also ascertain whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance taking into consideration the margin of appreciation afforded to the contracting states between the protection of freedom of expression as enshrined in article and the protection of the reputation of those against whom allegations were made a right which as an aspect of private life is protected by article of the convention in two fairly recent cases the court defined its own role in balancing these two conflicting interests it went on to identify a number of relevant criteria where the right to freedom of expression is balanced against the right to respect for private life see axel springer ag v germany gc no february and von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr b application of the above principles to the present case it was not disputed that the courts decisions in the present case and the sanctions imposed on the applicant amounted to an interference with his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the convention such interference was undoubtedly prescribed by law namely under articles and of the civil code the court further accepts that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others namely the good name reputation and credibility of am within the meaning of article of the convention accordingly the only outstanding issue is whether the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression was necessary in a democratic society in the instant case the applicant when commenting for rzeczpospolita on civil lawsuits against him lodged by am stated that in a way it is quite interesting to note who has lodged civil claims against me so far two agents and one their fierce defender the domestic courts examined the veracity of this statement and concluded that there was no basis for believing that am had defended any persons who had collaborated with the communistera security services the court takes note of the fact that the phrase in question constituted an attack on ams good name on account of his alleged indulgence for abuses committed under the communist regime such an utterance was capable of attaining a sufficient level of seriousness in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life the domestic authorities were thus faced with the difficult task of balancing two conflicting values namely freedom of expression for the applicant on the one hand and ams right to respect for his reputation on the other see axel springer ag gc cited above in such cases one factor the court has taken into account is the position of the person concerned by the publication whether or not he or she was a public figure or had otherwise entered the public scene another important factor is whether the statement in question contributed to a debate of general interest see krone verlag gmb h v austria no june in the present case the court observes that am is a former dissident a leading polish intellectual and the editorinchief of one of the countrys biggest daily newspapers who is actively engaged in political life and debates on current issues the court has already held that journalists and publicists like other persons actively involved in public life should display a greater degree of tolerance for criticism against them see kurski v poland no july despite the governments assertions see paragraph above the court considers that the statement at issue dealt with a matter of public concern namely the lustration of journalists such a matter could and in the present case did give rise to a public debate in this respect the court reiterates that there is little scope under article of the convention for restrictions on freedom of expression when a matter of public interest is at stake see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no echr extracts the court further observes that the domestic courts correctly recognised the context in which the applicants allegation had been made they expressly referred to the ongoing public debate in poland about the necessity of lustration see paragraph above and even noted that had the applicant used a more general formulation his statement would have fallen within the limits of acceptable criticism see paragraph above with regard to the classification of the statement at issue the applicant argued before the domestic courts that his statement had described ams position towards lustration in poland see paragraph above the domestic courts referring to expert opinions considered that the phrase in question had been a statement of fact see paragraphs and above there is no reason to depart from this assessment even statements made in the context of a wider debate on an issue of public concern should have a solid factual basis on which to base that allegation see ärztekammer für wien and dorner v austria no february however the domestic courts after carefully examining examples of public statements made by am concluded that there had been no such factual basis while am had indeed been critical towards the lustration law he had never defended the two persons named as agents by the applicant see paragraphs and above the court does not see a reason to find the domestic courts conclusion unreasonable or arbitrary therefore the court considers that the reasons given by the domestic courts were relevant and sufficient finally as regards the proportionality of the sanction the court notes that the applicant was ordered to cover the costs of proceedings to pay pln approximately eur to a charity and to arrange for the publication of an apology the fee for which was originally set at pln approximately eur but in respect of which the applicant benefitted from a substantial discount in an unknown amount the court further notes that in deciding on the amount to be paid to charity the domestic courts carefully weighed the possibilities and determined the amount of the fine imposed on the applicant in the light of his financial situation see paragraph above it has not been argued let alone shown that the amounts the applicant was obliged to pay had a disproportionate impact on him therefore the sanction imposed can not be found to have been disproportionate see mutatis mutandis genner v austria no january having regard to the above the court is satisfied that the authorities struck a fair balance between the interests of the protection of the plaintiffs reputation on the one hand and the applicants right to exercise his freedom of expression where issues of public interest are concerned on the other and that this assessment was made in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the interference could thus be reasonably considered necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of paragraph of article of the convention there has accordingly been no violation of that provision for these reasons the court unanimously declares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on january pursuant to rule and of the rules

51,the applicant was born in and lives in warsaw a background to the case in the applicant who is a journalist published a book entitled gazeta wyborcza beginnings and beyond gazeta wyborcza początki i okolice the book relates in an unfavourable light the story of the founding of gazeta wyborcza one of the best known polish daily newspapers with a nationwide distribution the newspaper was founded in in the wake of the socalled round table talks between the communist government and the heads of the then democratic opposition which ultimately led to the first semifree elections in poland since and to the ultimate dismantling of the communist regime by the end of the second edition of the applicants book was published in no reviews of the book were published in the press subsequently the applicant requested seven daily and weekly newspapers to publish an identical paid advertisement for the book the text of the proposed advertisement reads as follows it does not make for pleasant reading for the editorinchief of gazeta wyborcza friends the truth about gazeta wyborcza previously unseen documents and new witnesses stanisław remuszko a former journalist at the newspaper today working freelance has written the first ever book in poland europe and the world about gazeta wyborcza and its background do you have the faintest idea where the wealth of gazeta wyborcza comes from information available at wwwremuszkopl all the newspapers nasz dziennik wprost metropol newsweek polityka and rzeczpospolita refused to publish the advertisement gazeta polska was the first to agree to publish it and they signed a contract with the applicant however shortly afterwards the editor changed his mind refused publication and reimbursed the money paid by the applicant on june the applicant lodged seven identical claims with the warsaw regional court against the newspapers he requested that the court order the defendant newspapers to publish the advertisements the applicant referred to section of the press act see paragraph below arguing that nothing in the advertisement as proposed could reasonably be construed as being in breach of the law or third parties personal rights or contrary to the editorial policy of the defendants unless they considered that their editorial policy included a duty to protect the interests of gazeta wyborcza its editorinchief and publisher the applicant referred to article of the constitution and to section of the press act the warsaw regional court by judgments dated january may may january and march dismissed his actions against nasz dziennik wprost metropol newsweek and polityka respectively the applicant appealed by judgments of december and june the warsaw court of appeal allowed his appeals and ordered the defendant newspapers wprost and metropol to publish the advertisement concerned no appeal was lodged against those judgments during the appellate proceedings against nasz dziennik the warsaw court of appeal decided on october to make use of article of the code of civil procedure and put a legal question to the supreme court concerning the interpretation of article of the press act the supreme court refused to reply to this question by way of a decision of october czp see relevant domestic law and practice below on march the warsaw court of appeal rejected the applicants appeal against newsweek on formal grounds failure to pay the court fee by a judgment of april the warsaw court of appeal dismissed the applicants appeal against polityka by a judgment of july the warsaw regional court allowed the claim against gazeta polska the editors appealed the parties settled the case before the court of appeal the applicant submits that ultimately the advertisement was not published b the proceedings against rzeczpospolita the present case concerns the proceedings against rzeczpospolita and its editorinchief by a judgment of march the warsaw regional court dismissed the applicants claim it referred to section of the press act noting that the only requirements that paid advertisements to be published in the press had to comply with were the laws and principles of social coexistence zasady współżycia społecznego the editors of rzeczpospolita had been aware of the content of the book publishing the advertisement could have been regarded as endorsing that content which in turn could have been seen as breaching the personal rights of third parties this could have given rise to civil liability on their part not only were the editors allowed to refuse publication of an advertisement in breach of third parties rights they were even obliged to do so the applicant appealed referring to his right to freedom of expression he also argued that the firstinstance court had failed to provide any explanation as to why and how the advertisement breached third parties rights the warsaw court of appeal by a judgment of november allowed his appeal and remitted the case for reexamination the court first held that publication of advertisements was not covered by freedom of expression it further accepted the applicants argument about the lower courts failure to give adequate reasons for its judgment that court had held that the text of the advertisement was in breach of the law and third parties personal rights without adducing any arguments or reasons for that view the court further observed that the lower court had made its assessment with reference to the content of the book concerned this was not correct as under section of the press act lawfulness andor respect for third parties personal rights had to be examined with reference to the content of the advertisement only and not of the advertised service or the merchandise the content of the book was irrelevant in the case at hand by a judgment of january the warsaw regional court dismissed the applicants claim the court was of the view that the advertisement was incompatible with the newspapers editorial profile it further reiterated that the publication of the advertisement could have been understood as an endorsement of the applicants views expressed in the book this circumstance alone was sufficient to justify the refusal to publish the advertisement moreover rzeczpospolita and gazeta wyborcza were competitors in the press market the publication of the advertisement could have given rise to a suspicion that the editors of the former were trying to denigrate the latter in the eyes of the public further the editors were not obliged by law to endorse the dissemination of views and statements which they did not accept the court concluded that the advertisement did not meet the requirements laid down by section of the press act the court further stated referring to the views expressed by the supreme court in its judgments of january given in other cases brought by the applicant and concerning refusals to publish the same advertisement see paragraph below that the principle of commercial and contractual freedom dictated that a publisher was not under a legal obligation to publish all advertisements submitted to it because it did not have a monopoly on the market the applicant appealed reiterating his earlier arguments he expressly relied on article of the convention on february the warsaw court of appeal dismissed his appeal essentially endorsing the view expressed by the regional court the applicants lawyer submitted a cassation appeal against that judgment to the supreme court relying on the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by the constitution and by article of the convention by a judgment of march served on the applicant on june the supreme court dismissed the cassation appeal the court referred to its judgments given in other cases initiated by the applicant czp the nasz dziennik case in which it refused to answer a legal question see paragraph below i csk and the polityka case it observed that the press market was governed by business and commercial freedom it resulted therefrom that publishers of newspapers could not be held to be obliged to publish all advertisements simply at the request of clients the court referred to the courts judgment in the case of appleby and others v the united kingdom no echr vii it shared the courts view that the principles governing the exercise of the freedom of expression were also applicable to commercial speech however it did not necessarily result therefrom that in horizontal relations this freedom could not be limited in compliance with the constitutional principle of proportionality whereas it was true that section paragraph of the press act could not be said to be fully consistent with other provisions of that act it could validly be relied on by publishers wishing to refuse the publication of an advertisement if they were of the view that the advertisement as proposed was not compatible with the newspapers profile the supreme court concluded that the contested judgment was ultimately in conformity with the law ii relevant domestic law and practice article of the constitution provides freedom to express opinions and to acquire and disseminate information shall be ensured to everyone preventive censorship of means of social communication and licensing of the press shall be prohibited article of the constitution reads freedom of the person shall receive legal protection everyone shall respect the freedoms and rights of others no one shall be compelled to do that which is not required by law any limitation upon the exercise of constitutional freedoms and rights may be imposed only by statute and only when necessary in a democratic state for the protection of its security or public order or to protect the natural environment health or public morals or the freedoms and rights of other persons such limitations shall not violate the essence of freedoms and rights section of the press act reads as follows the press may publish paid advertisements and notices press advertisements shall not be in breach of the laws or of the principles of social coexistence advertisements shall be put in such a form as to make it clear that they are not to be identified with the editorial content the publisher and editor shall have the right to refuse the publication of an advertisement if its content or form is incompatible with the editorial profile or character of the newspaper in a decision of october czp the supreme court examined a legal question submitted to it by the warsaw court of appeal in the applicants case against nasz dziennik in its request the court of appeal summarised the difficulties arising in connection with the interpretation of section of the press act on the one hand section provided in paragraph that newspaper publishers had a right to publish advertisements this formulation suggested that they were free to decide on the choice of advertisement to be published on the other hand the provisions of paragraphs and of that section in so far as they defined situations where a publisher could refuse to publish an advertisement suggested that such refusal was possible only where that advertisement as proposed failed to meet the requirements laid down in those provisions otherwise publishers were obliged under the provisions to publish an advertisement as long as it had been duly paid for this conclusion was further strengthened by the fact that under paragraph of section of the act publishers did not bear any legal responsibility for the content of paid advertisements the court of appeal noted in its question that the freedom of expression of the person trying to place an advertisement had to be weighed against the publishers commercial freedom it further observed that if decisive weight was given to the publishers freedom to choose the advertisements to be published a form of unlimited control of content by private commercial entities could result comparable to preventive censorship the supreme court endorsed the reasoning of the requesting court that section of the press act could and indeed did give rise to discrepancies in its judicial interpretation a literal interpretation a contrario indicated that a refusal to publish an advertisement was justified only when one of the four conditions laid down in paragraphs and was not fulfilled had the legislator accepted that publishers were completely free in deciding whether to publish an advertisement or to refuse its publication it would have been redundant to list the requirements that an advertisement had to comply with in order to be published hence the majority of legal writers were of the view which was apparently also shared by the requesting court of appeal that this provision of the press act limited the publishers freedom in respect of commercial advertisements the supreme court expressed the view that it was difficult to accept such an opinion it observed that many arguments could be adduced in support of a contrary opinion however in the circumstances of the case it was not necessary for that court to give a reply to the legal question posed by the court of appeal as such a reply was not necessary for a decision on the merits of the case the outcome of the case pending before the court of appeal hinged only on that courts assessment of whether the advertisement as proposed was in breach of the applicable law not on the clarification of the scope of the publishers duty to publish a paid advertisement the supreme court made similar observations as to the interpretation of section of the press act in its two judgments given on january concerning the applicants cases i csk and the applicants claim to have the advertisement published was rejected in both cases the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the refusal to publish a paid advertisement by rzeczpospolita which was subsequently upheld by the courts breached his right to freedom of expression as protected by article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility exhaustion of domestic remedies the government argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies in that he had not availed himself of a constitutional complaint in their view he should have challenged section and of the press act as to its compatibility with the constitution the applicant disagreed he submitted that a constitutional complaint was not a proper remedy in his case there were no grounds on which to contest the constitutionality of the provisions concerned it was merely their interpretation by the courts in his case which he contested the court has held on numerous occasions that in poland a constitutional complaint is an effective remedy for the purposes of article of the convention where the alleged violation of the convention results from the direct application of a legal provision considered by the complainant to be unconstitutional see among other authorities szott medyńska v poland dec no october turning to the circumstances of the instant case the court notes that the alleged violation originated in the judicial interpretation of section of the press act the court points to the established jurisprudence of the constitutional court which provides that constitutional complaints based solely on an allegedly wrong interpretation of a legal provision are excluded from its jurisdiction as a result such a complaint can not be deemed an effective remedy within the meaning of article of the convention it is precisely such an interpretation and divergences in that interpretation which lie at the core of the present case therefore the constitutional complaint can not be regarded as an effective remedy in the applicants case see among many other authorities palusiński v poland dec no echr ciesielczyk v poland no june and sosinowska v poland no october for these reasons the governments plea of inadmissibility on the ground of nonexhaustion of domestic remedies must be dismissed alleged incompatibility ratione personae with the provisions of the convention the government further argued that the application should be declared incompatible ratione personae because it concerned horizontal relations between private parties the applicant submitted that the refusal to publish the advertisement for his book had been endorsed by the courts acting in the name of the state and that therefore the state had to be held responsible for the content of the judgments and for the outcome of the proceedings the court observes that this objection is a matter which goes to the merits of the case and will be addressed as a question of substance the applicants victim status the government further argued that the applicant could not claim to be the victim of a breach of the convention because he had not been negatively affected by the decisions complained of he had launched his own website on the internet and had been able despite the publishers refusals to publish the paid advertisements to disseminate information about his book and to sell it it appeared from information he had made available on that website that the third edition of the book had already sold out by the court reiterates that it falls firstly to the national authorities to redress any violation of the convention a decision or measure favourable to the applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a victim for the purposes of article of the convention unless the national authorities have acknowledged either expressly or in substance and then afforded redress for the breach of the convention see inter alia eckle v germany july series a no scordino v italy no gc no echr v and ladent v poland no march the notion of victim is to be interpreted autonomously see gorraiz lizarraga and others v spain no echr iii importantly it does not imply the existence of prejudice brumărescu v romania gc no echr vii in the present case no domestic decision was ever given which was designed for and capable of alleviating the negative impact on the applicants rights of the decisions complained of since his situation has not been remedied in any way this objection of the government must be dismissed lack of significant disadvantage the government further submitted that the applicant had not suffered a significant disadvantage because he had not been negatively affected by the decisions complained of he had been able to advertise his book on the internet and to sell it the court is of the view that this argument amounts to a mere rephrasing of the submissions which the government made with regard to the applicants victim status see paragraph above this objection must therefore also be dismissed conclusion the court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits applicability of article of the convention the government acknowledged that advertisements and other forms of commercial expression may fall within the scope of article of the convention however this provision was not applicable to the circumstances of the present case because it concerned a dispute between private parties whereas the rights and freedoms enshrined in the convention were of a vertical nature in that they concerned relations between the state and individuals the applicant disagreed he was of the view that article was applicable to the circumstances of the case the court has held on a number of occasions that this provision is applicable to advertising and commercial speech see casado coca v spain february series a no a and markt intern verlag gmb h and klaus beermann v germany november series a no it fails to see grounds on which to hold otherwise in the present case the court reiterates that it is in the first place for the national authorities and in particular the courts of first instance and appeal to construe and apply the domestic law see for example iglesias gil and aui v spain no echr v slivenko v latvia gc no echr x and włoch v poland no echr xi however this does not exempt the state from its general obligation under article of the convention to secure to everyone within its jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the convention the responsibility of a state may then be engaged as a result of not observing its obligation to enact domestic legislation or of applying existing domestic legislation in a manner incompatible with the convention standards the court reiterates the key importance of freedom of expression as one of the preconditions for a functioning democracy the court also reminds the preeminent role of the press in a state governed by the rule of law for example goodwin v the united kingdom march reports ii the caselaw of court has stressed on numerous occasions the function of the press as purveyor of information and public watchdog the press plays a special role in imparting information and ideas on political issues just as on those in other areas of public interest freedom of the press affords among others the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of their political leaders castells v spain judgment of april series a no genuine effective exercise of the freedom of expression does not depend merely on the states duty not to interfere but may require positive measures of protection even in the sphere of relations between individuals see fuentes bobo v spain no february and wojtas kaleta v poland no july concerning the obligation on the state to protect freedom of expression in the employment context or appleby and others v the united kingdom no echr vi where the court examined the scope of the states positive obligations in the regulation of the effective exercise of the freedom of expression in horizontal relations between private parties positive measures of protection may be required especially visàvis journalists and newspapers see özgür gündem v turkey no echr iii where the turkish state was found to be under a positive obligation to take investigative and protective measures where a pro pkk newspaper and its journalists and staff had been the victims of a campaign of violence and intimidation in determining whether or not a positive obligation exists regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the general interest of the community and the interests of the individual the search for which is inherent throughout the convention the scope of this obligation will inevitably vary having regard to the diversity of situations obtaining in contracting states and the choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources nor must such an obligation be interpreted in such a way as to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities see inter alia özgür gündem v turkey cited above and frăsilă and ciocîrlan v romania no may the boundaries between the states positive and negative obligations under the convention do not lend themselves to precise definition see verein gegen tierfabriken schweiz vg t v switzerland no gc no echr in both situations whether the obligations are positive or negative the state enjoys a certain margin of appreciation see for example mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no echr extracts the breadth of such a margin of appreciation varies depending on a number of factors among which the type of speech at issue is of particular importance whilst there is little scope under article of the convention for restrictions on political speech see among many other authorities sokołowski v poland no march and kaperzyński v poland no april a wider margin of appreciation is generally available to the contracting states when regulating freedom of expression in relation to matters liable to offend intimate personal convictions within the sphere of morals or especially religion see murphy v ireland no echr ix extracts and mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc cited above it is especially relevant for the assessment of the present case that the states have a broad margin of appreciation in the regulation of speech in commercial matters or advertising see markt intern verlag gmb h and klaus beermann v germany cited above series a no and casado coca v spain cited above series a no a in the determination of the existence and scope of the positive obligations of the state arising under article of the convention the court has had regard to the subject matter of the case to its capacity to contribute to the public debate to the nature and scope of restrictions imposed on the exercise of freedom of expression and to the availability of alternative means by which that liberty could be exercised as well as to the weight to be given to the competing rights of other persons or of the general public see appleby and others cited above and compliance with article of the conventiona the parties submissions the government submitted that in the event that the court was minded to find article applicable to the case the states authorities would be responsible only in respect of their positive obligations arising under that provision and not for any direct interference with the applicants rights in the present case these obligations had been fully complied with in the polish legal system all individuals were free to express their views private parties were free to create and shape their relations in compliance with the principle of freedom of economic activity that governed commercial relations in the free market in a democratic society the government considered that the measures taken in the present case had served the legitimate aim of protection of the rights of others namely the publishers of the newspapers concerned as to the lawfulness of the restrictions imposed on the applicant the government stressed that they had a legal basis in section and of the press act the domestic courts when examining the newspapers refusal to publish the advertisement had examined its legal grounds they had found that the refusal was in compliance with the said provision given that the proposed advertisement was incompatible with the newspapers editorial profile the government further opined that the difficulties in the interpretation of this provision referred to in the supreme courts decision of and judgments of had had no impact on the lawfulness of the refusal in the present case those difficulties had arisen essentially because prior to the cases brought before the courts by the applicant there had been no judicial practice concerning the interpretation to be given to section of the press act the applicants cases were the first occasion for the domestic courts to examine what balance should be struck between on the one hand the economic freedom of newspaper publishers and on the other private parties freedom of expression in the context of information of a commercial nature this absence of relevant judgments had resulted in doubts as to whether publishers were obliged to accede to each and every request to publish a paid advertisement in a newspaper or had a right to refuse to do so the supreme court had developed its jurisprudence in this matter solely on the basis of the cases brought by the applicant that caselaw should be regarded as established and would serve in the future as a basis for decisions in further cases of the same kind they further argued that the applicant should have known that publishers were allowed to refuse to publish an advertisement subject to the requirements that it was contrary to the law or the principles of social coexistence or incompatible with a publications editorial profile these requirements had never been doubted either by legal scholarship or the judiciary rzeczpospolitas refusal to publish the applicants advertisement had been based on two of these requirements namely inconsistency with the editorial profile and the character of the newspaper the government concluded that the relevant law was formulated with sufficient precision for the applicant to foresee the consequences of his actions namely that the publication of his advertisement could be refused on legal grounds as to the issue of necessity in a democratic society the government argued that it was essential to balance the applicants freedom of expression against the freedom of expression of the press and the publishers freedom of economic activity the refusal of the newspaper rzeczpospolita to publish the applicants advertisement had not prevented him from either advertising or selling his book there had been other easily accessible means of informing the public about his product such as internet advertising setting up his own internet website launching an internet blog signing up with social networks printing and distributing leaflets and posters organising meetings with the public or launching his own newspaper or other publication hence the general public had been informed of the book despite the refusal to publish the applicants advertisement the government submitted that the reasons given by the courts in the present case had been relevant and sufficient they had found that the proposed advertisement was incompatible with rzeczpospolitas editorial profile as a serious newspaper dealing with legal economic and social issues and which was politically neutral and objective conveying information in a proper and respectful manner and avoiding the publication of scandalous and sensationalist texts the courts had observed that the advertisement concerned the editorinchief and the publisher of a rival newspaper publishing the advert could have created the impression that rzeczpospolita shared the authors views and could thus have called its objectivity into question the government further asserted that publishing the advertisement would have been not only contrary to the law but also in breach of professional ethics the courts had further been of the view that imposing on the newspaper the obligation to publish it would also have infringed the publishers right to decide on its editorial content the government concluded that the measures complained of had been justified by a pressing social need and were proportionate and therefore compatible with the requirements of article of the convention the applicant submitted that the refusal to publish a paid advertisement by rzeczpospolita which had subsequently been endorsed by the courts had breached his right to freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention his book concerned issues of public concern and interest given that gazeta wyborcza was a powerful newspaper which played an important role in shaping the political views and attitudes of its numerous readers the book aimed to present the general public with significant facts concerning the manner in which that newspaper had been created and how it had risen to its position of significance and power no reviews of his book had ever been published in the printed media the applicant was of the view that this was most likely to be because the book had been embarrassing for the publishers of gazeta wyborcza who had been sufficiently feared and respected to be able to prevent anything hostile to it being published in the press for an effective exercise of the freedom of expression and for a genuine political debate among citizens it was important that views and facts ignored or silenced by the mainstream media would be allowed to see the light of day the applicant had been prevented from publishing the advertisement in rzeczpospolita and also in a number of other newspapers the fact that he had been silenced in that way breached both the constitution and the conventionb the courts assessment the applicant complains that the refusal to publish a paid advertisement by rzeczpospolita breached his right to the freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention the court observes that the applicant could not publish an advertisement in the rzeczpospolita newspaper owned by a limited liability company as the publisher refused to publish that advertisement subsequently the civil courts examined the applicants claim for a decision ordering that newspaper to publish the advertisement the courts found against him the court notes at the outset that the application concerns the outcome of a dispute between two private parties in the domestic proceedings the applicant argued that the newspaper was under a positive obligation to publish a paid advertisement the newspaper publisher relied on its freedom from external interference in the exercise of its freedom of expression and the courts endorsed this position the court is of the view that in such a situation the right invoked by the applicant has to be interpreted and applied with due consideration for the rights of the press protected under article of the convention the court has previously examined cases involving access to particular venues or forums for the purposes of exercising the freedom of expression it has held that notwithstanding the importance of that freedom article does not bestow any freedom of forum for the exercise of that right as regards entry to private property or even necessarily to all publicly owned property see appleby and others cited above the same finding was reiterated in berladir and others v russia no july mutatis mutandis in the examination of such cases the court took into consideration whether the bar on access to a given forum had the effect of preventing any effective exercise of freedom of expression the instant case however concerns not a private venue but a media whose fundamental freedom of expression is protected under convention the court has examined a number of cases concerning restrictions on advertisement in television see vg t verein gegen tierfabriken v switzerland no echr vi animal defenders international v the united kingdom gc no april in those cases the applicants were prevented from having their advertisements broadcast by a general prohibition imposed on certain types of political speech the court considered that a prohibition of an advertisement by way of a general measure could be justified under article of the convention see animal defenders international cited above the instant case differs from the above mentioned in that the general rules examined so far by the court in its caselaw affected directly not only the potential advertisers but also the broadcasters in the present case the refusal to publish the advertisement sought by the applicant did not result from a general ban on broadcasting specific types of commercial speech but from a decision by the newspapers publisher the court has already held that privately owned newspapers must be free to exercise editorial discretion in deciding whether to publish articles comments and letters submitted by private individuals or even by their own staff reporters and journalists the states obligation to ensure the individuals freedom of expression does not give private citizens or organisations an unfettered right of access to the media in order to put forward opinions see mutatis mutandis murphy v ireland no july saliyev v russia no october in the courts view these principles apply also to the publication of advertisements an effective exercise of the freedom of the press presupposes the right of the newspapers to establish and apply their own policies in respect of the content of advertisements it also necessitates that the press enjoys freedom to determine its commercial policy in this respect and to choose those with whom it deals in the present case it has not been argued let alone shown that the applicant had any difficulties in publishing his book or that the authorities tried in any way to prevent or dissuade him from publishing it or that more generally the media market in poland was not pluralistic the court accepts that the issues examined in that book may contribute to a debate about the mission of the press in polish society the analysis of the political and institutional origins of a national newspaper the financial dealings of its publisher and analysis and comment about that newspapers functioning and role in society were topics of public interest however the character of the issues explored by that book does not detract from the fact that the paid advertisements proposed by the applicant were essentially aimed at promoting the distribution and sales of his book hence they were primarily designed to further the applicants commercial interests at no point was the applicant prevented from disseminating information about the book by any means he wished indeed he created his own internet website through which he informed the general public about the book its content and its potential significance for the public debate in the present case the applicant had recourse to civil proceedings he requested the courts to order that newspaper to publish a paid advertisement for his book the domestic courts examined his case under the provisions of the press act hence the domestic law provided an effective procedural framework within which the applicant could seek to have the substantive issues involved in his case determined by judicial authorities the courts were well aware of the difficulties arising in the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the press act they were of the view that the crux of the case lay in the necessity to adjudicate on conflicting interests and rights the applicants right to disseminate ideas on the one hand and the constitutionally and internationally guaranteed rights and freedoms of the publisher such as the right to freedom of expression and freedom of commercial activity on the other as to whether the domestic courts correctly applied those provisions the court reiterates that the application and interpretation of the domestic law fall primarily within the competency of the domestic authorities which are in the nature of things particularly well placed to settle the issues arising in this connection compare inter alia barthold v germany march series a no the warsaw regional court in its judgment of january had regard to the publishers freedom to shape the newspapers editorial profile subsequently the court of appeal in its judgment of january essentially shared that view ultimately the supreme court when examining the applicants cassation appeal observed that the press was governed by commercial freedom it was of the opinion that publishers could not be held to be obliged to publish paid advertisements simply at the request of their clients that court was of the view that the principles governing free speech were also applicable to commercial speech the supreme court referred to its own judgments given in other cases brought before it by the applicant it noted that the freedom of expression could be restricted in compliance with the principle of proportionality enshrined in the constitution the court is therefore satisfied that the courts carefully weighed the applicants interests against the legitimate rights of the publishers such as their own freedom of expression and economic freedom compare and contrast khurshid mustafa and tarzibachi v sweden no december where no such exercise was performed in addition the supreme court was aware of the human rights issues arising in the case and had recourse to the courts interpretation of the positive obligations arising in connection with the freedom of expression in the case of appleby v the united kingdom furthermore the supreme court had regard to the principle of proportionality enshrined in article of the constitution which covered all situations in which the exercise of individual rights was restricted hence the court accepts that the analysis made by the domestic courts was fully compatible with the convention standards the court agrees with the analysis of the case carried out by the domestic courts it finds that their conclusion that in a pluralistic media market press publishers should not be obliged to carry advertisements proposed by private parties is compatible with the freedom of expression standards under the convention having regard to the circumstances of the case seen as a whole the court is of the view that the state has not failed to comply with its obligation to secure to the applicant the freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that his rights guaranteed in article were violated he drew attention to the fact that the decisions of the polish courts in several similar lawsuits he brought against different newspapers were inconsistent article in so far as relevant reads as follows in the determination of his civil rights and obligations everyone is entitled to a fair hearing by a tribunal a the parties submissions the government reiterated that prior to the applicants cases there had been no similar cases brought to the attention of the polish courts consequently no judicial practice could have been created as regards the existence and scope of a newspapers obligations to publish paid advertisements the supreme court examined a number of cases brought before it by the applicant and in a number of decisions given between and consolidated its approach to the interpretation of section of the press act it properly balanced the interests and freedoms involved in these cases weighing the publishers freedom of expression and freedom of economic activity against the right to freedom of expression of the person wishing to publish paid advertisements in the printed media the applicant did not comment on the governments submissions b the courts assessment in its recent grand chamber judgment in the case of nejdet şahin and perihan şahin v turkey gc no october the court reiterated the main principles applicable in cases concerning the issue of conflicting court decisions these may be summarised as followsi it is not the courts function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the convention see garcía ruiz v spain gc no echr i likewise it is not its function save in the event of evident arbitrariness to compare different decisions of national courts even if given in apparently similar proceedings as the independence of those courts must be respected see ādamsons v latvia no june ii the possibility of conflicting court decisions is an inherent trait of any judicial system which is based on a network of trial and appeal courts with authority over the area of their territorial jurisdiction such divergences may also arise within the same court that in itself can not be considered contrary to the convention see santos pinto v portugal no may and tudor tudor cited above iii the criteria that guide the courts assessment of the conditions in which conflicting decisions of different domestic courts ruling at final instance are in breach of the fair trial requirement enshrined in article of the convention consist in establishing whether profound and longstanding differences exist in the caselaw of the domestic courts whether the domestic law provides for machinery for overcoming these inconsistencies whether that machinery has been applied and if appropriate to what effect see iordan iordanov and others cited above see also beian no cited above ştefan and ştef v romania nos and january schwarzkopf and taussik cited above december tudor tudor cited above ştefănică and others cited above and teresa kowalczyk v poland no october iv the courts assessment has also always been based on the principle of legal certainty which is implicit in all the articles of the convention and constitutes one of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law see amongst other authorities beian no cited above iordan iordanov and others cited above and ştefănică and others cited above v the principle of legal certainty guarantees inter alia a certain stability in legal situations and contributes to public confidence in the courts the persistence of conflicting court decisions on the other hand can create a state of legal uncertainty likely to reduce public confidence in the judicial system whereas such confidence is clearly one of the essential components of a state based on the rule of law see paduraru v romania no echr xii extracts vinčić and others v serbia nos and others december and ştefănică and others cited above vi however the requirements of legal certainty and the protection of the legitimate confidence of the public do not confer an acquired right to consistency of caselaw see unédic v france no december caselaw development is not in itself contrary to the proper administration of justice since a failure to maintain a dynamic and evolutive approach would risk hindering reform or improvement see atanasovski v the former yugoslav republic of macedonia no january turning to the present case the court notes that the applicant argued that his separate cases concerning his claim to have identical advertisements about his book published had been decided differently firstly the court notes that the applicant lodged seven identical claims against the publishers of various newspapers with the warsaw regional court that court by judgments dated january may may january and march dismissed his actions against nasz dziennik wprost metropol newsweek and polityka respectively having regard to the uniformity of those decisions it can not be said that there were discrepancies in that courts approach to identical cases following the applicants appeal the warsaw court of appeal ordered two of the defendant newspapers wprost and metropol to publish the advertisement concerned those judgments became final as no cassation appeals against them were lodged by the publishers with the supreme court that court was not therefore given an opportunity to pronounce on the issues involved in them the court further notes that the appeal against the publisher of newsweek was rejected on formal grounds that case is therefore of no relevance for the assessment of the present complaint the court further notes noted that the warsaw court of appeal when examining the applicants appeal against the publishers of nasz dziennik noted that the interpretation of section of the press act could give rise to difficulties it described those difficulties in detail in the legal question concerning article of the code of civil procedure which it decided to submit to the supreme court see paragraphs above the court is therefore satisfied that under the provisions of the polish civil procedure there was a mechanism available to the courts for the purposes of clarifying major interpretation difficulties and harmonising the judicial approach to those difficulties by way of a decision of the highest judicial authority and that that mechanism was resorted to in the present case hence the criteria relied on by the court when dealing with inconsistencies in judicial practice were thereby complied with see iordan iordanov and others v bulgaria no it is true that ultimately the supreme court refused to answer that question however as it was of the view that such an answer was not necessary for the purposes of that case it can not be said to have been unjustified the court of appeal noted in its question that the freedom of expression of the person trying to place an advertisement had to be weighed against the publishers commercial freedom it further observed that if decisive weight was given to the publishers freedom as to the choice of advertisements to be published a form of unlimited control of content by private commercial entities could result to preventive censorship moreover there was no arbitrariness in the decisions given in the present case the applicants concerns arising in connection with his right to freedom of expression in the context of his case against the rzeczpospolita newspaper were examined in depth at three levels of jurisdiction including the supreme court that court accepted the applicants cassation appeal for an examination on the merits a decision given only in respect of cases raising important legal issues it is also significant that the supreme court in the present case relied on its own analysis of the issues involved in the interpretation of article made in the applicants previous cases iii i csk i csk referred to above it therefore sought thereby to ensure uniformity in its approach in similar cases finally the applicants cases which serve as a background to the present case and which were brought before the supreme court by way of cassation appeals were decided on the merits in the same manner as the applicants claim to have the advertisements published and were ultimately dismissed the cases against nasz dziennik i csk and polityka i csk the court further notes the governments argument that the decisions concerning the existence of an obligation on newspaper publishers to publish each and every paid advertisement proposed to them was very few and that practically all of them had been given in the applicants cases see paragraph above it can not therefore be said that that there were profound and long standing differences in the caselaw or that distinct strands of jurisprudence had developed leading to similar cases being decided differently compare and contrast iordan iordanov and others v bulgaria referred to above in such circumstances it can not be said that there were differences in the relevant caselaw that had resulted in judicial uncertainty it follows that this complaint is manifestly illfounded and must be rejected in accordance with article a and of the convention iii alleged violation of article of the convention on account of the unreasonable length of the proceedings the applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the reasonable time requirement within the meaning of article of the convention however the court notes that the applicant failed to lodge a complaint about the breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time under the law of june on complaints about a breach of the right to an investigation conducted and supervised by a prosecutor and to a trial within a reasonable time ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu przygotowawczym prowadzonym lub nadzorowanym przez prokuratora i postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki see charzyński v poland dec no march it follows that this complaint must be rejected under article and of the convention for nonexhaustion of domestic remedies iv other alleged violation of the convention the applicant further complained under article of the convention alleging unfairness of the civil proceedings against him in that the supreme court had failed to address his arguments properly the court finds that the facts of the case do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the convention it follows that these complaints are manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article and must be rejected pursuant to article for these reasons the court unanimously declares the complaint under article of the convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on july pursuant to rule and of the rules of court françoise elens passos ineta ziemele registrar president,,,
52,the applicant was born in and lives in vienna at the time of the events the applicant worked for the association asyl in not which offers legal and social support to asylum seekers and refugees in an amendment to a number of laws concerning the status of foreigners and of asylum seekers and concerning relevant proceedings fremdenrechtspaket was drafted and adopted by parliament the amendments entered into force on january on december the then federal minister for interior affairs lp died unexpectedly of an aneurysm at the age of on january the applicant published a statement on the associations website entitled one less whats coming now eine weniger was kommt danach it continued the good news for the new year lp minister for torture and deportation is dead die gute meldung zum jahresbeginn lp bundesministerin für folter und deportation ist tot after referring to some specific individual stories of asylum seekers the text stated further that mrs p was a desk war criminal just like many others there have been in the atrocious history of this country completely desensitised indifferent to the consequences of their laws and regulations the compliant instrument of a bureaucracy contaminated with racism no decent human is shedding tears over her death lp war eine schreibtischtäterin wie es viele gab in der grausamen geschichte dieses landes völlig abgestumpft gleichgültig gegen die folgen ihrer gesetze und erlässe ein willfähiges werkzeug einer rassistisch verseuchten beamtenschaft kein anständiger mensch weint ihr eine träne nach the applicant concluded the text by suggesting that their goal for the new year was to fight for a new minister who would make good the damage done by lp so that austria could return to being a country welcoming asylum seekers and a place where human rights were respected gp the late ministers husband filed a private prosecution privatanklage for defamation against the applicant and the association on september the vienna regional court landesgericht für strafsachen wien convicted the applicant of defamation in respect of the abovequoted passages of the statement and sentenced him to a fine in the amount of eur half of the fine was suspended for three years it dismissed gps request for recognition of the associations liability for its employees actions the court found that the average reader would understand the relevant passages of the statement to mean that lp had ordered or tolerated the torture pending expulsion or the deportation of detainees and had violated human rights the word torture in particular implied the intentional infliction of physical or psychological suffering an average reader would also place the word deportation deportation in the context of the historical events under the nationalsocialist regime which forcefully deported segregated groups of people to ghettos and camps to subject them to forced labour or extermination the statement in question suggested that lp exercised her political function in a particularly despicable way that she was indifferent to officials criminal abuse of authority in relation to asylum seekers and that her actions were motivated by racist sadistic xenophobic and nationalsocialist attitudes the publication of the statement had triggered considerable reaction from the media and the public the applicant had been criticised as tactless and disrespectful in response thereto on january the applicant published in a daily newspaper a reply in which he stated that his comments had been directed solely towards lp and he apologised to her family members who were not responsible for the late ministers inhumane policies the regional court acknowledged that a criminal charge of defamation was at odds with the right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by the convention it found that the voicing of opinions by refugee associations criticising politicians and their legislative projects represented an important corrective element and that the limits of acceptable criticism were particularly widely drawn in the context of the present case however in the courts opinion the published statement overstepped the limits of acceptable criticism the legislative background to the amendment of the laws governing foreigners and asylum seekers and the fact that criticism was allowed to be shocking still could not justify positioning lp in a nationalsocialist and racist context and suggesting that she had tolerated the intentional physical illtreatment of detainees pending expulsion or deportations such accusations against the then only recently passed away lp together with the acclamation of her death and the call on decent people not to mourn her passing clearly went beyond the limits of acceptable criticism in a democratic society moreover the allegations made by the applicant had not been proven to be true nor had he shown any journalistic diligence in that regard the applicant filed an appeal on points of law and fact and also appealed against the sentence on may the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht wien dismissed his appeal referring to the reasoning of the firstinstance court it conceded that the word deportation nowadays had acquired the additional meaning of expulsion or removal and was not only used in the context of the nationalsocialist regime but also in the context of the forced expulsion of foreigners however the context of the word in which it had been used a desk war criminal just like many others there have been in the atrocious history of this country acted as a reminder of the nationalsocialist history of the country therefore even though the statements at issue were political value judgments politische wertungen the applicant had not produced any proof of a factual basis for his allegations the applicant had further argued that following the caselaw of the european court of human rights and of the domestic courts with regard to article the impugned statement was covered by freedom of expression the court of appeal however found that even such caselaw did not provide carte blanche for the applicant to make comparisons with the nationalsocialist regime without any factual basis that decision was served on the applicants counsel on june on november the applicant lodged a request for the renewal of the criminal proceedings erneuerung des strafverfahrens pursuant to article a of the code of criminal procedure with the aim of having the proceedings reopened and the conviction set aside on october the supreme court dismissed the request it stated that the admittedly broad limits of tolerable criticism in the political discourse did not cover excessive value judgments without any factual basis statements made in even heated political conflicts needed to respect a minimum of decency and moderation in the present case the supreme court found that the evaluation by the courts had rightly led to the conclusion that the text in question justified the limitation of the applicants right to freedom of expression the value judgment suggesting criminal behaviour on the part of lp had no factual basis the courts had not misjudged the considerable public interest in the discussion concerning migration and asylum policy however the applicants statements had not contributed to that public discussion since they were directed at defaming and discrediting the late minister the court further noted that the sanction imposed was in view of the disrespectful statements and their temporal proximity to lps death appropriate and even moderate the supreme courts decision was served on the applicants counsel on november ii relevant domestic law article of the criminal code strafgesetzbuch defines defamation as follows as it may be perceived by a third party anyone who makes an accusation against another of having a contemptible character or attitude or of behaving contrary to honour or morality and of such a nature as to male him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six months or a fine the person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true as regards the offence as defined in paragraph he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to assume that the statement was true article of the criminal code strafgesetzbuch as in force until january read in the case of an offence under sections or of this criminal code committed against a deceased or missing person his or her spouse or close relatives or siblings shall be entitled to ask for prosecution the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the austrian courts judgments had violated his right to freedom of expression he relied on article of the convention which reads everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the court notes that the complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the court notes that it is common ground between the parties that the vienna regional courts judgment of september upheld by the court of appeal constituted an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the convention an interference contravenes article of the convention unless it is prescribed by law pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph and is necessary in a democratic society for achieving such an aim or aims the parties submission the government submitted that the interference had been in accordance with the law had pursued a legitimate aim and had been necessary in a democratic society the judgments of the austrian courts had likewise pursued a legitimate aim namely the protection of the rights and reputation of others moreover the interference had been proportionate to its aim and the reasons adduced had been relevant and sufficient the conviction had been based on article taken in conjunction with article of the criminal code regarding the necessity of the interference the government argued that in cases which require a balancing of the respective interests under articles and of the convention the domestic courts enjoyed a certain margin of appreciation in the instant case the domestic courts had classified the statements in question as a value judgment lacking a sufficient basis in fact in doing so the domestic courts had interpreted the wording of the impugned statement in its overall context they had also taken into account that the limits of acceptable criticism were drawn more widely with regard to politicians and that it had been the applicants intention to contribute to a general debate on a subject of public interest namely the rights and the protection of asylum seekers and the development of the law in this field they had also considered the recent events and developments in the austrian asylum and aliens law relied on by the applicant in support of his allegations and had carefully weighed up the applicants arguments moreover they had taken account of the wording used by the applicant and the fact that the statement had been made immediately after the ministers death against this background they concluded that the impugned passages amounted to an unjustified personal attack on the late minister herself lastly the sanction imposed on him had been moderate as an amount of only eur had been set by way of fine suspended on probation in the applicants view the interference had neither been in accordance with the law nor had it pursued a legitimate aim a deceased minister would no longer have any interest in pursuing a political career and the interest of her surviving husband were not of the same kind or intensity since he was not a politician and did not wish to pursue a political career the contents of the applicants statement did not essentially concern the person of the deceased minister but rather the policy for which she had to be held liable this was made clear by the reference to bureaucracy contaminated by racism this value judgment had a factual basis namely the constantly deteriorating situation of foreigners and asylum seekers in austria in the applicants view the deceased minister had represented an extremist position within austrian society especially in the eyes of people who fought for human rights as she had combined cruelty with bonhomie and charm as was often the case with austrians who committed war crimes during world war ii austrian society had closely observed the criminal proceedings against the applicant and had clearly understood that he was merely showing commitment and concern for a good cause even if the statement might have been drafted in a more cautious way the applicant had nevertheless not exceeded the boundaries of legitimate political criticism the courts assessmenta the principles established by the courts caselaw according to the courts wellestablished caselaw the test of necessity in a democratic society requires the court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a pressing social need whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient see the sunday times v the united kingdom no april series a no editions plon v france no echr iv standard verlags gmb h v austria no no june in assessing whether a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation the court reiterates that in matters of freedom of expression its task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation the court will look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient and whether they were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see among many other authorities cojocaru v romania no february there is no doubt that article enables the reputation of others that is to say of all individuals to be protected but in such cases the requirements of such protection have to be weighed against the interests of an open discussion of political issues see lingens v austria july series a no the right to protection of reputation is a right which is protected by article of the convention as part of the right to respect for private life an attack on a persons reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see a v norway no april axel springer ag v germany gc no february the domestic authorities are therefore faced with the difficult task of balancing two conflicting values namely freedom of expression on the one hand and the right to respect for reputation on the other braun v poland no november the margin of appreciation left to the national authorities in assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it is not however unlimited but goes hand in hand with european supervision by the court whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr the court has already had occasion to lay down the relevant principles which must guide its assessment in this area it has thus identified a number of criteria in the context of balancing the competing rights see von hannover no cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc no february the relevant criteria thus defined are contribution to a debate of public interest the degree of notoriety of the person affected the subject of the news report the prior conduct of the person concerned the content form and consequences of the publication and where appropriate the circumstances in which the statement was made see print zeitungsverlag gmb h v austria no october and mutatis mutandis couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no november dealing appropriately with the dead out of respect for the feelings of the deceaseds relatives falls within the scope of article see with further references hadri vionnet v switzerland no february editions plon v france cited above and putistin v ukraine no november on the other hand there is little scope under article of the convention for restrictions on freedom of expression in the area of political speech or debate where freedom of expression is of the utmost importance or in matters of public interest brasilier v france no april therefore the limits of acceptable criticism are drawn more widely as regards a politician than they are as regards a private individual unlike the latter the former inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance see lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc nos and echr iv see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france cited above nevertheless the court has also found that regardless of the forcefulness of political struggles it is legitimate to try to ensure that they abide by a minimum degree of moderation and propriety especially as the reputation of a politician even a controversial one must benefit from the protection afforded by the convention lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france cited above moreover a clear distinction must be made between criticism and insult if the sole intent of a particular form of expression is to insult a person an appropriate sanction would not in principle constitute a violation of article of the convention mutatis mutandis kincses v hungary no january in its caselaw the court has distinguished between statements of fact and value judgments the classification of a statement as fact or as a valuejudgment is a matter which first and foremost falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities in particular the domestic courts see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no however the court can change this classification under its supervisory role see kharmalov v russia no october pinto pinheiro marques v portugal no january in previous cases the court has emphasised that the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article however even where a statement amounts to a value judgment there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it failing which it will be excessive jerusalem v austria no echr ii as the court has noted in previous cases the difference lies in the degree of factual proof which has to be established see scharsach and news verlagsgesellschaft v austria no echr xi as regards value judgments which have been found by the national courts to be of a defamatory character the court has assessed the national courts findings on the question of whether the language used in the statement was of an excessive or dispassionate nature whether an intention of defaming or stigmatising the opponent was disclosed and if the statement was built on a sufficient factual basis see lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france cited above and kincses v hungary cited above the court further considers that the use of the term nazi does not automatically justify a conviction for defamation on the ground of the special stigma attached to it see scharsach and news verlagsgesellschaft v austria no echr xi concerning the term neofascist see karman v russia no december b application of the above principles in the present case the court observes that the interference with the applicants freedom of expression was based on articles and of the criminal code that law is formulated with sufficient precision to enable a citizen to regulate his conduct and the applicant does not provide any reasonable argument against this assumption accordingly the interference is prescribed by law the court further agrees with the government that the interference did pursue the aim of the protection of the reputation or rights of others namely those of lp and the close members of her family in particular her husband which constitutes a legitimate aim within the meaning of paragraph of article see editions plon v france cited above the court like the parties considers that the applicants statement concerned an issue of public interest and may be seen as a contribution to a political debate of public interest namely that concerning the situation of asylum seekers and foreigners under the then new immigration police act fremdenpolizeigesetz and the asylum act asylgesetz this intention is shown by the reporting of specific individual stories of asylum seekers the court notes that the domestic courts classified the statement under consideration as a value judgment the court will proceed on the assumption that this classification is correct it is furthermore undisputed that lp as former federal minister for the interior had been a public figure and was still remembered by people at the time of publication of the impugned statement however the press release was issued on the day after her unexpected death a fact that intensified the impact of the words used the applicants statement was published within the immediate period of her familys grief and was likely to cause considerable damage to the late ministers reputation see lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france cited above the court observes that the timing of the impugned statement is a relevant circumstance in the present case and therefore has to be taken into consideration when balancing the conflicting rights under article and the statement was an expression of satisfaction with the sudden death of lp the applicant made the day after she had passed away to express insult on the day after the death of the insulted person contradicts elementary decency and respect to human beings see editions plon v france cited above see also leroy v france no october and is an attack on the core of personality rights as regards the contents of the applicants statement the court considers that the applicant did not discuss the subject matter in a general and substantial manner but immediately launched a personal attack on the late minister he first of all expressed satisfaction about her death suggesting that no decent human should feel grief about her passing away and then continuing by comparing her to highranking nazi officials who had committed atrocities and war crimes during the second world war by calling her a desk war criminal schreibtischtäterin it is true that in the statement published on january in the newspaper der standard the applicant apologised to the family of lp for his statement but even before this court he insisted that the comparison of lp to nazi war criminals had been correct and justified the court however considers that even if regarded as value judgements such serious and particularly offensive comparisons immediately after lps death demand a particularly solid factual basis in this respect the court considers that the applicant did not make any distinction between the person of lp and the politics she stood for from his point of view the applicant argued that lp had shown disreputable character traits in the course of the political negotiations concerning several provisions of the asylum law which constituted clear violations of the individual rights granted by the federal constitution and the convention however the court observes that the vienna court of appeal carefully examined this argument and came to the conclusion that the constitutional court had confirmed the compatibility of almost all these legal provisions with the rights enshrined in both the convention and the federal constitution the applicant further argued that a factual basis for lps alleged motives was apparent in a tv interview she gave after the conviction of four police officers who had been found guilty of the torture of a person being detained pending expulsion the vienna court of appeal evaluated this argument and found that lps unwillingness to apologise in the republics name did not go to show that lp had ordered or at least tolerated the torture further evidence submitted by the applicant was of a general kind regarding the political situation in austria as a whole and therefore did not provide a sufficient factual basis for the personal accusations against lp lastly the applicant submitted copies of press interviews with the heads of other ngos and newspaper articles in order to show that his opinion that the situation of asylum seekers in austria was constantly deteriorating was shared by others having examined these documents the court can not identify a factual basis for the motives of lp as alleged by the applicant within these same documents therefore the court considers that the reasons given by the court were relevant and sufficient as regards the proportionality of the sanction the court notes that the applicant was ordered to pay a fine of eur half of the fine being suspended on probation that amount appears moderate taking into account the nature of the applicants statement and the circumstances in which it was made and disseminated therefore the penalty imposed can not be found disproportionate it follows that there has been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the complaint admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on january pursuant to rule and of the rules of court

53,in and lives in bucharest the applicant was represented by mr cl popescu a lawyer practising in bucharest the government were represented successively by their agents ms c brumar mr v mocanu and ms sm teodoroiu of the romanian ministry of foreign affairs background to the case the applicant is a judge attached to the bucharest court of appeal in march the applicant wrote an article about the president of the court of cassation under the heading nothing about how a comrade prosecutor has become the president of all judges it read to my great grandfather no killed by the communists in when the communist camp was becoming more unbearable the current president of the court of cassation was appointed prosecutor in the town where i was born the town had a steel industry and a shipyard and therefore was crawling with members of the securitate from small informants to the most privileged and smooth torturers i was twelve years old and i was in the sixth grade because she was almost always at work and in order to spend as much time as possible with us my mother used to take me and my younger brother to the parades on august once we were taken to a stadium to see nicolae ceauşescu who had travelled to our town by helicopter i remember that we stood for countless hours under the scorching sun there were many people in shabby clothes all of us were standing upright repeating the slogans next to me a woman was only mouthing the ovations because she was so tired so when i turned my head under the scorching sun i saw a man grabbing her arm and telling her discreetly to follow him only because she had mouthed the words i was no longer interested in seeing the great leader we left and after we had left the stadium well behind i kept asking my mum why meanwhile the president of the court of cassation was a rising prosecutor how did the comrade prosecutor fight to root out the enemies of the socialist order and for the pursuit of the new man naturally with her weapon the case files i started to imagine what could happen in the dungeons from where some came out dishonoured broken and scared and many did not come out alive who was hurting them what did those who got hurt and those who were hurting them looked like where are the marks even today there is no desire to find out afterwards in the seventh grade during my internship in agriculture i saw female detainees on the field where we were harvesting tomatoes they were wearing a thick uniform with a striped skirt and a scarf on their head i wanted to memorise one of their faces the detainee status seemed incompatible to me with being a woman they were crying and asking us to come near them as if we had been their own children other women appeared authoritarian dressed in uniforms fitted with leather belts my mum told me that many of them had been convicted for abortion women chose to kill their unborn because they did not have the means to raise them in addition to this internal turmoil they were being hunted down by the police miliție and the prosecutors how did the comrade prosecutor manage at that time naturally still for the pursuit of the new man for me the world that had already taken shape consisted of severe poverty the silence and terror from the earths surface and the unknown hell from the dungeons from where screams were never heard the prosecutors were somewhere above in an untouchable shining world which made it impossible to see the sky for all those in my world all these comrades usurpers of christ and his law sternly guarded the communist prison the comrade prosecutor has also floated above us omnipresent for fourteen years until when she transformed into a judge that is to say when i was twentysix years old during all this time i did my homework by candlelight the candle glued to the edge of a jarfood was rationed cold water only ran for two hours a day warm water was long gone we shivered with cold indoors we waited at bus stops until we were freezing and afterwards we were lucky if we found room on the buss footboard to go to school now i realise that all this time long as my entire childhood and adolescence has not been wasted because the comrade prosecutor has accomplished so much as to become the president of all judges herself the president of the country appointed her in in a european state where the justice system is continuously being reformed that is to say to the old man a new face that is why the result is and will be an eternal failure the applicants name was in the byline which also stated that she was a judge attached to the bucharest court of appeal the article was printed both in a national newspaper cotidianul and on an internet news site juridicero disciplinary and codeofconduct proceedings against the applicant disciplinary proceedings against the applicant on march the judicial investigation unit inspecția judiciară the ij attached to the superior council of the judiciary consiliul superior al magistraturii the csm opened a preliminary investigation against the applicant on its own motion on the grounds that the article published by her was referring to the professional career of the president of the court of cassation on april the ij produced a note concerning the article published by the applicant and proposed that the note be forwarded to the disciplinary commission for judges comisia de disciplină pentru judecători the cdj attached to the csm to establish whether a disciplinary investigation had to be opened against the applicant for breaching article a of law no concerning conduct of judges and prosecutors affecting their professional honour and dignity the ij held that the article had drawn a parallel between the oppressions of the communist regime and the rise of the president of the court of cassation who had worked as a prosecutor at that time judge lds had been appointed president of the court of cassation in lawfully after she had passed the lawfully required vetting process to ensure that she had not been a member of or had collaborated with the secret services before suggesting that she had behaved inappropriately at the time when she had been a prosecutor without providing specific facts had made it impossible for the ij to verify the allegations the article the applicant had put her name to had introduced the idea that judge lds had carried out her professional duties unlawfully between and when she had worked as a prosecutor the distorted presentation of judge ldss professional activity and the suggestion of questionable moral behaviour on her part had resulted in the president of the court of cassations professional reputation being damaged the applicants personal opinions expressed in the article had constituted behaviour calling into question the honour and professional integrity of judge lds under relevant national and international law free speech was subject to exceptions when a persons right to honour reputation and personal image were affected also when exercising it judges had to behave in such a way as to preserve the dignity of their office and the independence and impartiality of the judiciary by expressing publicly her opinions about the professional activity of a judge the applicant had breached the boundaries of the duty of discretion which had implied moderation and restraint in presenting her opinions the ij took the view that in the applicants case there had been evidence suggesting that the disciplinary offence set out in article a of law no had been committed it considered that the boundaries of the right to freedom of expression had been overstepped and that the applicants assessment of the court of cassations presidents professional activity had been conducted in a manner capable of creating a negative image about the way she had behaved as a prosecutor on april the cdj ordered that a disciplinary investigation be initiated against the applicant for the disciplinary offence set out in article a of law no on may the ij produced a note about the outcome of the disciplinary investigation concerning the applicant and proposed that the note be forwarded to the cdj to establish whether disciplinary proceedings had to be instituted against the applicant by relying on some of the arguments of the note of april see paragraphs above the ij took the view that there was evidence in the case that might suggest that the elements of the disciplinary offence set out in article a of law no had been met in the applicants case on may the cdj closed the proceedings against the applicant in so far as they concerned the commission by the applicant of the alleged disciplinary offence set out in article a of law no however the cdj referred the case to the judges section of the csm secția pentru judecători a consiliului superior al magistraturii the sjcsm for it to determine whether the applicant had breached article of the code of conduct for judges the code it held that article a of law no concerned circumstances where a judge or prosecutor had affected his or her own professional honour and dignity or the reputation of the justice system by his or her own actions and conduct this had not been the applicants case her article had been written in a literary manner had referred to aspects of the communist era which had been well known and had reflected the restrictions imposed on the rights of the people during those times which the applicant had been recalling the article had also contained accurate information concerning the fact that judge lds had worked as a prosecutor and as a judge and that starting from she had been appointed president of the court of cassation the applicant had not used violent or foul language capable of disturbing public opinion and her article had not had a significant media impact however the manner in which the applicants article had been written had created a negative image of how judge lds had carried out her duties as a prosecutor during communism by using the expression comrade prosecutor in the title of the article the applicant had implied that the president of the court of cassation had been at fault for having become the president of all judges even though she had been a prosecutor during the communist regime by contrasting the situation of the people who were poor silent and oppressed with that of the prosecutor lds who was characterised untouchable and rising the applicant had practically held lds guilty for the fact that she had had a superior status because of her position as a prosecutor also from the content of the article it could be understood that the case files processed by lds during communism had been used as a means of oppression in order to root out the enemies of the socialist order and for the pursuit of the new man or to convict women for abortion in addition the applicant stated generically in the article that all these comrades implying also the comrade prosecutor mentioned in the title of the article had been usurpers of christ and his law and had sternly guarded the communist prison lastly the article noted ldss appointment as president of the court of cassation and referred to the fourteen years she had worked as a prosecutor during the communist regime when she has accomplished so much as to become the president of all judges herself the cdj took the view that by writing the article in the abovementioned manner the applicant had brought into question her compliance with the relevant legal provisions concerning the professional conduct of legal professionals by relying on amongst other things article of the code article of the convention the caselaw of the european court of human rights the court and on the applicants statements the cdj held that the applicant had overstepped the limits of expression that had to comply with the duty of discretion thus the balance between an individuals right to freedom of expressions and a democratic states legitimate interest in ensuring that a person holding public office had complied with the scope of article of the convention had been broken the cdj held furthermore that by expressing opinions which could make a reasonable observer that is to say a wellintentioned disinterested and informed person doubt a colleagues professional integrity and morality the applicant had overstepped the limits of freedom of expression in relation to that persons right to personal image honour and reputation therefore there had been evidence suggesting that the applicant had breached article of the code because in the article under her name she had implied that lds had not performed her professional duties lawfully between and when she had been working as a prosecutor the cdj lastly held that the malicious and distorted presentation of ldss professional activity and the suggestion that her behaviour had been questionable without any supporting evidence in that regard had caused unfounded suspicions to be raised about ldss professionalism the personal opinions expressed by the applicant in her article had amounted to conduct that had affected the right to personal image honour and reputation of the judge conduct proceedings against the applicant decision by the sjcsm in a decision of october the sjcsm held that the applicants article had breached article of the code which set out one of the limitations imposed on an officer of the courts right to freedom of expression by relying on similar arguments to the ones relied on by the cdj see paragraphs above the sjcsm held further that the applicants article had been written in a manner that had created a negative image of how judge lds had carried out her duties as a prosecutor during communism the sjcsm dismissed the applicants argument that her article had merely been a literary essay and found that she had overstepped the limits of freedom of expression that had to comply with the duty of discretion thus the balance between her individual right to freedom of expression and a democratic states legitimate interest in ensuring that a person holding public office had complied with the scope of article of the convention had been broken the applicants argument that article of the code could not be read without taking into account the definition of good faith set out in article of law no could not be accepted given that that article defined bad faith and serious negligence and concerned exclusively the exercise of professional functions by judges or prosecutors the sjcsm also reiterated the cdjs finding concerning the applicants conduct see paragraphs above in addition the sjcsm held that in its decision of march declaring unconstitutional the recently passed legislation on lustration the constitutional court had noted that in their opinion submitted to the court the council of the romanian prosecutors association had stated that in accordance with the relevant law in force during communist times civilian prosecutors had been competent to investigate only ordinary offences not political offences and that prosecutors had not only not served the regime but had been the only obstacle against abuses committed by repressive bodies in contrast to the abovementioned point the applicant had referred to the case files processed by lds during that time as being used as a means of oppression in order to root out the enemies of the socialist order and for the pursuit of the new man or to convict women of abortion without presenting any concrete evidence she was therefore practically blaming the president of the court of cassation simply because she had worked as a prosecutor during communism thus she had clearly affected the professional and moral integrity of a fellow judge the applicants challenge against the sjcsm decision on december the applicant challenged the decision before the plenary of the csm she argued that article of the code concerned the expression of an opinion but failed to define the concept in the absence of a definition of this concept it could be reasonably argued that it meant expressing a subjective point of view however in order to affect a persons image honour and reputation such a personal opinion had had to clearly and expressly concern concrete acts and facts capable of compromising the professional integrity or the morality of that person her article had not contained any explicit clear statement concerning the morality and professional integrity of judge lds her essay had contained only several rhetorical questions which had not amounted to a categorical opinion also by using the expression comrade prosecutor she had referred to an undeniable fact within the framework of portraying the communist times relying on international and european instruments concerning judges the applicant argued further that those instruments required special diligence in cases concerning the disciplinary investigation of judges including a careful selection and assessment of strictly objective and essential elements so that any exposure of a judge to unacceptable pressure would be avoided the same requirements had to be complied with in cases of a conduct investigation given that pursuant to domestic law an acknowledgement of a breach of the code amounted to a disciplinary sanction which would prevent her career advancement unlike in other european states the romanian code had not been merely a guide on moral issues but a disguised disciplinary code her conduct which had consisted in her publishing a literary article depicting her personal experiences had been examined in a deficient manner by breaching the highly important objectivity criteria set out in the relevant international instruments thus some segments and expressions from the text had been assessed excessively and had been given subjectively a certain meaning which had been preferred by the investigators also the rules and principles concerning a judges duty of discretion had been misunderstood and had been interpreted very rigidly by relying on arguments that had had no connection to the text the fact that the disciplinary proceedings had been diverted into codeofconduct proceedings supported the argument of the pressure imposed of its own motion by an independent body which had not been created to investigate judges the applicant also argued that her essay had concerned the post of president of the court of cassation and had not referred to a colleague because she had not had any interest in lds as a person under the relevant international rules concerning judges a judge had to be more tolerant and open to questions and criticism since he or she was very exposed to the public that was even more so in cases of judges exercising an official state function the person exercising an official state function was a subject of public interest and therefore it was natural that all aspects concerning that persons past and present career be debated publicly by any person lastly the applicant argued that her essay had been part of a series of other essays that she had already published and had not been a single and isolated work decision by the csms plenary by a decision of january the csms plenary dismissed the applicants challenge it held that the applicants status as an officer of the court had not deprived her of her right to freedom of expression however her conduct consisting of the statements she had made in her article published in the press had breached an officer of the courts duty of discretion thus the balance between an individuals right to freedom of expressions and a democratic states legitimate interest in ensuring that a person holding public office had complied with the scope of article of the convention had been broken an officer of the courts duty of discretion implied moderation and restraint in presenting his or her opinions the applicant had been entitled to express her opinion on some aspects concerning the activity of the justice system however the manner of making some of her statements had broken the abovementioned balance especially since there was no evidence suggesting that under the circumstances the expressions used had represented for her the only way of conveying the information she had intended to present by publishing the article by the manner of presenting the events and the expressions used the applicant had affected the moral and professional integrity of a fellow judge her statements had not been value judgments but had in fact conveyed certain specific points and had been a clear and unequivocal personal opinion concerning the moral and professional integrity of the president of the court of cassation her argument that her article had concerned exclusively the post of president of the court of cassation had been illfounded the opinions expressed in the article had concerned the person holding that post since a distinction could not be made between the post and the person holding it moreover presenting the realities of communist times could have been done in a less intense manner which would not have affected a colleagues professional integrity and honour and with a focus on the problems faced by the justice system the plenary also held that the applicants statements had to be examined in the context of the lack of trust in the justice system that had been apparent for a long time and which had seriously affected its authority and the appearance of impartiality clearly a judge should have known better than anyone the risks of statements which could have a significant impact on the reputation of the system in this context using balanced language with an objective presentation of the systems deficiencies was better than making statements breaching professional conduct about a colleague therefore the applicants argument that her essay had not contained a categorical opinion but only literary rhetorical questions could not be accepted the manner in which the applicant had chosen to express her opinion about the realities of the communist regime in suggesting that a fellow magistrate had had questionable conduct and professional evolution had resulted in unjustified doubts being raised about the morals and professional integrity of the president of the court of cassation lastly the csms plenary concluded that the personal opinions expressed by the applicant in her article had amounted to conduct that had affected the right to personal image honour and reputation of judge ldsthe applicants appeal against the decision by the csms plenary the applicant appealed against the csms plenarys decision before the court of cassation and reiterated the arguments of her challenge of december against the sjcsms decision of october see paragraph above judgment of the court of cassation in a final judgment of november the court of cassation dismissed the applicants appeal as illfounded it held that the applicants article had presented in a distorted way the professional activity of the president of the court of cassation suggesting that she had behaved questionably without presenting supporting evidence the expressions used by the applicant such as comrade prosecutor all these comrades usurpers of christ and his law and have sternly guarded the communist prison may have caused a reasonable observer that is to say a wellintentioned disinterested and informed person to doubt the moral and professional integrity of the person targeted by the article and clearly overstepped the boundaries of the applicants duty of discretion according to the relevant international instruments and the courts caselaw the freedom of expression of officers of the court was exercised mainly under the umbrella of the courts caselaw and of the convention both as regards the duties and responsibilities incumbent on those who serve justice and as regards the limitations imposed on their rights which were necessary to guarantee the authority and impartiality of the justice system as a result the applicants argument that by presenting in an exclusively literary manner her personal life experiences she had not tarnished the dignity of the position of judge or the independence and impartiality of the judiciary could not be accepted because the article had contained clear references to the professional activity and the behaviour of the president of the court of cassation and had made references to the communist period when she had worked as a prosecutor the court held furthermore that the applicants argument that the disciplinary proceedings had been diverted into conduct proceedings on the motion of an independent body which had not been created to investigate alleged misconduct by judges could also not be accepted the rules and regulations concerning the organisation and functions of the csm and its bodies provided expressly for a procedure concerning the examination of alleged breaches of the code which was different from the procedure set out for the examination of alleged disciplinary offences also the manner in which the decisions taken during these separate sets of proceedings could be challenged was different therefore the cdjs decision of may see paragraph above had not represented a diversion of the disciplinary proceedings into codeofconduct proceedings other relevant information other csm and administrative proceedings brought by the applicant on december the applicant asked the csm to remove from her professional file the sjcsms decision of october the csms plenarys decision of january the court of cassations judgment of november and any other information concerning the alleged breach of the code by her in addition she asked the csm to annul its decision to introduce the code she argued that the csms plenarys decision to introduce the code and the code itself had been unconstitutional and therefore any information concerning an alleged breach of the code by her in her professional case file had been unconstitutional on january the csms plenary dismissed the applicants requests as illfounded reasoning that there had been no legal grounds for removing the documents indicated by her from her professional file in addition the decision to introduce the code and the code itself had not been unconstitutional on april the applicant brought administrative proceedings against the csm seeking to have the relevant documents and any other information concerning the alleged breach of the code by her removed from her professional file and the csms decision to introduce the code annulled and article of the code struck down in addition she raised an unconstitutionality objection concerning the decision to introduce the code she argued that amongst other things article of the code was unlawful because it was unclear and lacked precision in so far as the person who was protected by this article was concerned in particular it was unclear whether the protection provided by the article in question concerned a colleague who was working for the same court as the officer of the court under investigation or one who was working for any other court in the country a finding that an officer of the court had breached the code could have negative consequences on his or her career in so far as professional evaluations and career advancement were concerned on september the piteşti court of appeal the court of appeal referred the applicants unconstitutionality objection concerning the csm decision to introduce the code to the constitutional court the constitutional court proceedings appear to be still pending in a judgment of october which was amenable to appeal the court of appeal rejected the administrative proceedings brought by the applicant against the csm as illfounded there is no evidence in the file whether this set of proceedings ended in a final judgment information submitted to the court by the parties the applicants participation in competitions for posts at the court of cassation on february the csm asked the ij to produce a report on the professional integrity of the candidates including the applicant who had been declared eligible to participate in a competition organised from january to may for promotions to the court of cassation on april the ij produced the report concerning the applicant it noted that i following press allegations about unlawful rent reimbursement claims made by the applicant the relevant authorities had stopped paying for her rent and she had initiated court proceedings against the authorities ii the sjcsm had decided to impose a disciplinary penalty on the applicant following a conflict she had had with a colleague in but the decision had not been final at the time of the report iii and that according to the final sjcsm decision of october see paragraph above the applicant had breached article of the code subsequently the ij concluded that the applicant had not met the necessary requirements of conduct duties and integrity to compete for a court of cassation post on january and november the csm informed the government that the applicant had met the lawful conditions for participation in the competition see paragraph above but she had failed to attend the actual exams the outcome of the conduct proceedings against her had not prevented her from applying for promotions according to the relevant legal provisions the sjcsms decision of october had been attached to the applicants professional file had to be taken into account during her professional evaluation and would be effective for three years the applicants professional appraisals for and had not been finalised because of objective administrative reasons on june the csm informed the applicant that a judges possible promotion to the court of cassation was assessed in the light of a candidates last three finalised professional appraisals attached to his or her professional file the rating of a judges activity in each of the appraisals had to be very good for him or her to be eligible to participate in the competition an appraisal reports finding concerning a judges integrity was effective only for the threeyear period under assessment and did not have any effect on subsequent reports given the manner in which the ratings were calculated a codeofconduct penalty could not result on its own in the officer of the court not being given a very good rating in his or her appraisal report since the csm had examined seven cases concerning possible breaches of article of the code by judges and prosecutors in two cases including the applicants case the sjcsm had found that article of the code had been breached while in the remaining five cases it had been decided in final decisions that the aforementioned article had not been breached on november the president of the bucharest court of appeal informed the government that the applicant would not be eligible to apply for promotions to the court of cassation until january regardless of the outcome of her appraisals because in the court of cassation had confirmed the disciplinary penalty imposed on the applicant for the events which had taken place in see paragraph above the court of cassations judgment of april in a final judgment of april published in the official gazette no of february the court of cassation allowed the administrative proceedings brought by judge gb who was attached to a county court who had been found to have breached article of the code following a public statement concerning the moral integrity of lds who had been the president of the court of cassation at the time of the statement against the csm seeking to have article of the code struck down and an order that the judgment be published in the official gazette the court held that the article in question was unlawful because it was unclear and had lacked precision in so far as the person who was protected by this article was concerned in particular it was unclear whether the protection provided by the article in question concerned a colleague who was working for the same court as the judge under investigation or who was working for any other court in the country a finding that an officer of the court had breached the code could have had negative consequences on his or her career in so far as the professional evaluations and career advancement were concerned in a final judgment of december the court of cassation allowed the proceedings brought by judge gb seeking to have the final sjcsm decision finding her responsible for breaching article of the code annulled with reference to the final judgment of april see paragraph above information concerning the governments former agent on january the government asked the court for an extension of the initial timelimit set for the submission of their observations on the admissibility and merits of the applicants case in a letter which was signed on ms brumars behalf the court granted the requested extension and the government eventually submitted their observations to the court on april ms brumar was replaced from the post of government agent on february on february following an enquiry submitted by the applicants representative about ms brumars appointment to the post of government agent the governments general secretariats public relations department sent him an email informing him that the manner in which ms brumar had been appointed to the post had been unlawful relevant legal framework the relevant provisions of the code of conduct for judges and prosecutors as in force at the relevant time read as follows article the judges and prosecutors relations within the groups they belong to must be based on respect and goodfaith regardless of their work experience and position the judges and prosecutors were prohibited from expressing their opinion with regard to the moral and professional integrity of their colleagues the lawpreliminary remarks on february following ms brumars removal from the post of government agent the applicant asked the court to hold that all the procedural documents submitted by the government in the case were null and void and that the government were estopped from raising any inadmissibility objections because their former agent had not been appointed lawfully she relied on the governments general secretariats public relations departments email of february confirming the unlawfulness of the appointment in question see paragraph above in addition the applicant argued that the government had submitted several facts concerning the relevant domestic rules and laws applicable at the time the applicant had published her article which had been manifestly erroneous and had clearly proved the governments intention to mislead the court the court notes that according to rule of the rules of court the contracting parties are represented by agents who may be assisted by advocates or advisers it notes further that none of the information available in the instant case file suggests that an official decision administrative or judicial has been taken with regard to the alleged unlawful appointment of ms brumar to the post of government agent also the government have not informed the court either before or after ms brumar was replaced of a potential impediment to her standing on their behalf moreover the court has not identified any procedural incident that would have raised doubts about her status as government representative therefore the court sees no reason to conclude that the governments observations or any other documents were not validly submitted as to the applicants allegation that the government have provided erroneous or misleading information the court notes that there is no indication in the case file of any intention to mislead the court in the light of the above the court considers that the applicants abovementioned request see paragraph and allegation see paragraph are illfounded and must be rejected alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the measure imposed on her that was automatically preventing her from taking part in exams that would have furthered her professional advancement and the lack of foreseeability of article of the code in so far as it had failed to define the concept of an opinion expressed on the moral and professional integrity of a colleague had amounted to a breach of her freedom of expression she relied on article of the convention which in so far as relevant reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility submissions by the partiesa the government the government argued that the applicant had not suffered any significant disadvantage and had not had any interest in pursuing her application before the court as indicated also by the court of cassations judgment of november the codeofconduct penalties had to be distinguished from the disciplinary penalties because they were covered by different laws and had different effects in particular a codeofconduct penalty had not had an automatic effect on a judges option to apply for a promotion even assuming that such a penalty would have made it virtually impossible for an officer of the court to obtain the very good rating which was needed for his or her promotion application to be validated the applicants allegation that the officer of the court would have been automatically prevented from sitting the actual exams was unsubstantiated the authorities conclusion that the applicant had breached article of the code had not prevented her from applying for and participating in the competition therefore the applicants failure to sit all the actual exams organised during the aforementioned competition raised questions as to what interest she could still have in pursuing her application before the court the applicant had not provided any argument and had not shown any actions that she had taken that would support her allegations therefore she had been unable to prove any actual damage that she had suffered following the decision of october b the applicant the applicant contested the governments submissions the applicant contended that the codeofconduct penalty imposed on her could have negative effects on her career indefinitely since she was already a judge with the court of appeal the only promotion that she could still pursue was that of judge with the court of cassation however her application for such a competition would be conditional on receiving a very good rating in her last three professional appraisals moreover the decision imposing the codeofconduct penalty had been permanently included in her professional file and would be taken into account every time she applied for a promotion to the court of cassation also her chances of passing the competition organised by the court of cassation in had been rather theoretical even though it was true that the abovementioned decision had not made it automatically impossible for her to obtain a very good rating in her appraisal the courts assessment the court reiterates that it has considered the rule contained in article b of the convention to consist of three criteria firstly has the applicant suffered a significant disadvantage secondly does respect for human rights compel the court to examine the case thirdly has the case been duly considered by a domestic tribunal see smith v the united kingdom dec no march the first question of whether the applicant has suffered any significant disadvantage represents the main element inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor this first criterion of the rule rests on the premise that a violation of a right however real from a purely legal point of view should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court the assessment of this minimum level is in the nature of things relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case the severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicants subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case in other words the absence of any significant disadvantage can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant however the applicants subjective perception can not alone suffice to conclude that he or she has suffered a significant disadvantage the subjective perception must be justified on objective grounds see with further references cp v the united kingdom dec no september a violation of the convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage regardless of pecuniary interest see margulev v russia no october with further references the court reiterates the key importance of freedom of expression as one of the preconditions for a functioning democracy see appleby and others v the united kingdom no echr vi and margulev cited above in cases concerning freedom of expression the application of the admissibility criterion contained in article b of the convention should take due account of the importance of this freedom and be subject to careful scrutiny by the court this scrutiny should encompass among other things such elements as contribution to a debate of general interest and whether a case involves the press or other news media see with further references sylka v poland dec no june in the instant case the court notes that the applicants subjective perception of the alleged violation was that it has affected her prospects of career advancement and had penalised her for participating in a debate of general interest concerning ultimately the reform and the functioning of the justice system see paragraphs above and below seen in the context of the essential role a functioning justice system has in ensuring the proper functioning of any democratic society see among other authorities narodni list dd v croatia no november the alleged violation of article of the convention in the present case concerns in the courts view important questions of principle moreover the government have not contested the applicants assertions that the penalty imposed on her had been permanently recorded in her professional file and that it would be an element taken into account if she applied for a promotion to the court of cassation the court is thus satisfied that the applicant suffered a significant disadvantage as a result of the codeofconduct proceedings opened against her regardless of whether her pecuniary interests were actually affected or not and does not deem it necessary to consider whether respect for human rights compels it to examine the case or whether it has been duly considered by a domestic tribunal see mutatis mutandis margulev cited above accordingly the court dismisses the governments objection regarding the alleged lack of a significant disadvantage within the meaning of article b of the convention the court notes that the complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merits submissions by the partiesa the applicant the applicant contended that even though over time many officers of the court had publicly criticised other such officials only the applicant and judge gb had been found guilty by the sjcsm of breaching article of the code both judges had publicly criticised lds when she had been the president of the court of cassation however the sjcsms decision concerning judge gb had been overturned by the courts following the court of cassations judgment of april thus the applicant had remained the only judge found guilty of breaching article of the code and would remain the only judge punished for breaching that article because the article was no longer in force the codeofconduct penalty imposed on the applicant had been an interference with her right to freedom of expression as proven also by the court of cassations judgment of april the interference with the applicants right had not been provided for by law because article of the code had been unclear and unforeseeable this judgment had had an erga omnes effect also even assuming that the interference had pursued a legitimate aim it had not been necessary in a democratic society had not been required by a pressing social need had not been proportionate and the reasons provided for it had been unconvincing and subjective the article published by the applicant had been essentially a literary text which had portrayed mainly her feelings as a child during the communist regime the applicants value judgments concerning the activity of the public prosecutors during the communist period had had a solid factual basis specifically the historical truth and the relevant legislation at that time her article had been part of a larger debate in romanian society concerning the prosecutors role in the totalitarian regime it had been published one day after the court of cassation at a hearing presided by lds had asked the constitutional court to examine the unconstitutionality of a law enacted by parliament concerning the lustration of the prosecution service also the article had concerned a debate of general interest specifically around the suitability of a former communist prosecutor to lead a pro european reform process of the justice system as president of the highest court in the country it had not concerned lds in her capacity of judge but in her capacity as president of the highest court the article had contained factual information namely that lds had worked as prosecutor during the communist regime the applicant had not accused the president of the court of cassation of having committed unlawful acts in her capacity as a prosecutor but had only wondered whether lds had committed such acts and whether as a member of an oppressive communist establishment she had been apt to represent the romanian justice system the applicant had stated that lds had applied the legislation in force during the communist regime which it was a notorious historical fact had breached human rights the applicant had never stated that lds had breached the law the language of the applicants article had not been violent or defamatory it had contained rhetorical questions and no accusations and had concerned a person that had not been immune to criticism and for whom the level of acceptable criticism had been higher than for an ordinary judge the expression comrade prosecutor had been inspired by the relevant legislation in force at the time of the communist regime when the use of the word comrade had been mandatory the applicant argued that even though she had been able to apply for the court of cassation competition any new element that would have appeared during that competition would have affected its outcome she had realised during the competition that her application would certainly be invalidated for reasons which had included the conclusion of the ijs report of april relying exclusively on the measure taken against her in the latter report had been the main point of discussion during an oral exam assessing the candidates integrity and conduct the applicant was required to take part in to avoid public humiliation she had decided to withdraw from the competition however in all future court of cassation competitions a candidates integrity was assessed by taking into account all the ijs reports produced during past competitions which in her case would include the reportb the government the government argued that even though the applicant had not been a journalist she had decided to publish the article on a website specialising in judicial matters and the article had been subsequently reproduced by ordinary newspapers they acknowledged that the sjcsm decision of october which was subsequently confirmed by the court of cassations judgment of november could be viewed as an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression however the interference had been provided for by law had pursued a legitimate aim and had been necessary in a democratic society the relevant rules concerning the organisation and functions of the csm as well as article of the code had been accessible and foreseeable to the applicant and therefore she would have been able to adjust her conduct accordingly it could not be argued that article of the code had been unclear to the point where the applicant could not have expected a codeofconduct investigation being opened against her even though concise the article in question had been clear that officers of the court had to refrain from expressing opinions that could have raised doubts about a colleagues professional and moral integrity it had been sufficient to know the definition of the word integrity in order to be able to comprehend the meaning of the impugned article it did not seem that the applicant had contested the lawfulness and foreseeability of article of the code in her appeal against the decision of october or had asked for the impugned article to be struck down her arguments concerned rather the absence of the elements of the offence regulated by the aforementioned article the csm had examined several alleged breaches of article of the code also the court of cassations judgment of april given in the context of proceedings brought by another judge had only held that the word colleague had lacked clarity and precision within the meaning of article of the code the aforementioned judgment had not questioned the need to have in place legal provisions which punished opinions expressed by officers of the court on the professionalism and integrity of other judges or prosecutors in addition the courts caselaw had not prohibited the national authorities from limiting a judges or prosecutors freedom of expression the government argued that in the applicants case the domestic authorities had acted within their discretion the issue raised in the present case was the lack of foreseeability of the code in so far as it had failed to define the concept of an opinion expressed on the moral and professional integrity of a colleague however the court of cassations judgment of april had focused on the meaning of the concept of a prosecutors or judges colleague and not on the question of the concept of opinion expressed on the moral and professional integrity of a colleague the measure taken against the applicant had sought to protect the rights and reputation of others as well as the prestige of the justice system the domestic court had struck a fair balance between the competing interests at stake and had justly concluded that the applicants statements had overstepped the limits of acceptable criticism in respect of a person who at that time had held the highest position in the justice system the applicant had accused lds of having taken advantage of an abusive and undemocratic system where the prosecutors had been untouchable in a language which even though phrased in the form of rhetorical questions had gone beyond simple satire or speculation she had portrayed lds as a young comrade prosecutor rising working in the service of a system promoting social injustice until she had been appointed to lead the highest court in the country even though the applicants statements could be considered to have been made within the framework of a debate of general interest and to concern a subject of general interest namely the justice system her freedom of expression had not been absolute she had been bound to act in good faith and to provide credible and accurate information as in other similar cases examined by the court the applicants article had contained factual allegations which had not been confirmed by a sufficient factual basis the applicants statements had been made with the intention to cast doubt on ldss honesty and reputation she had never openly denied that her statements had concerned lds or claimed that her statements had been taken out of context or misinterpreted she had never retracted or limited the scope of her statements in a manner that would have convinced the court to deliver a judgment favourable to her the government contended that the applicant had not been prevented from applying to participate in the court of cassation competition by the fact that she had breached article of the code also in its report of april the ij had reached its conclusions concerning the applicant by relying not only on the fact that she had breached article of the code as suggested by the applicant but also on the fact that she had committed a disciplinary offence in and had been punished for it according to the information provided by the relevant domestic authorities it was the aforementioned disciplinary punishment and not the fact that she had breached article of the code that currently prevented the applicant from applying to participate in promotion competitions to the court of cassation unlike in other similar cases examined by the court the applicant in her article had not touched on questions concerning the commission of an offence by another officer of the court an element which could have been considered to warrant on its own the interest of the public but had tried merely to associate a judges career with the communist regime in full knowledge of the negative connotation prompted by such an association also the byline of the article included the applicants full name and her position of judge even though she had alleged that the article had only been a recount of her childhood memories and not of aspects connected to her professional life by signing off on the article in this manner the applicant had accepted that the arguments exposed in her article would gain a certain weight in the eyes of readers given that statements made about a system by a person working within the system were always perceived to be more accurate the authorities had not imposed a disciplinary penalty on the applicant nor was the codeofconduct penalty imposed on her severe excessive or disproportionate in addition the applicants article had not contained any general criticism concerning the functioning of the justice system and had not presented any information about a judge or prosecutor which had been based on her direct personal experience the courts assessmenta whether there was an interference the court notes that the parties agreed that the sjcsms decision of october which was subsequently confirmed by the court of cassations final judgment of november amounted to an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the convention see paragraphs and above the court sees no reason to hold otherwiseb whether the interference was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim according to the government the interference complained of was provided for by law in particular article of the code which was accessible foreseeable and sufficiently clear moreover the interference complained of pursued a legitimate aim namely that of protecting the rights and reputation of others as well as the prestige of the justice system see paragraphs and above the applicant did not seem to contest that article of the code had been accessible but she argued that it had lacked sufficient precision and foreseeability she seemed to be prepared to accept though that the interference had pursued a legitimate aim see paragraphs and above the court notes that in the present case the interference was based on article of the code as in force at the relevant time and that this provision was accessible the parties views however diverge as far as the precision and foreseeability of the said provision are concerned the court must thus examine whether the provision in question fulfilled the precision and foreseeability requirements the court reiterates that a norm can not be regarded as law unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the individual to regulate his or her conduct he or she must be able if need be with appropriate advice to foresee to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances the consequences which a given action may entail those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty experience shows this to be unattainable whilst certainty is highly desirable it may entail excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances accordingly many laws are inevitably couched in terms which to a greater or lesser extent are vague and whose interpretation and application are a question of practice see sunday times v the united kingdom no april series a no perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extracts and karapetyan and others v armenia no november the scope of the notion of foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the text in issue the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed chauvy and others v france no echr vi as concerns the provisions in question at the relevant time the court finds no ambiguity in the contents of article of the code it provides that judges were prohibited from expressing an opinion with regard to the moral and professional integrity of their colleagues it is true that the impugned article did not define precisely the concepts of opinion expressed on the moral and professional integrity and colleague however the court notes that the sjcsm the csm plenary and the court of cassation have regarded the points made by the applicant in her article as falling within the concept of opinion expressed on the moral and professional integrity which does not appear to be an arbitrary or unpredictable interpretation likewise they considered implicitly that the concept of colleague included judges who worked in other courts than the one the applicant was working for see paragraphs above the approach of the authorities in the applicants case appears to have been consistent at least in so far as the interpretation of the concept of colleague was concerned with the approach the same authorities had in regard to judge gb when they imposed a final codeofconduct penalty on the aforementioned judge see paragraph above in any event the court notes that in the codeofconduct proceedings the applicant had not raised any argument regarding the alleged lack of precision of the term colleague used in article of the code it is true that in april the court of cassation eventually found during administrative proceedings brought by judge gb against the csm that the concept of colleague was not defined with sufficient precision as it could either mean a colleague working in the same court or one who was working in any other court and therefore considered the impugned legal provision was unclear see paragraph above however the court has repeatedly held that the mere fact that a legal provision is capable of more than one construction does not necessarily mean that it does not meet the requirement of foreseeability see perinçek cited above moreover the court of cassations judgment was delivered years after the applicant had published her article or the codeofconduct proceedings against her had ended with a final court judgment the applicant pointed out that there had been very few cases in which article had been applied however even assuming that at the time when the applicant published her article there was no caselaw concerning the interpretation of article of the code this would not render the domestic authorities application of that provision unpredictable or arbitrary compare satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june the court considers that the possibility that a codeofconduct penalty could be imposed on her on the basis of the concept of opinion expressed on the moral and professional integrity of a colleague must have been foreseeable for the applicant the impugned legal provision was enacted to cover the conduct of judges who formed a specific and restricted group more specifically opinions expressed by them about the integrity of other colleagues at the time of the impugned events the legal provision in question had been in force for several years and the applicant who was a professional judge and who had extensive experience in the field could not claim to be ignorant of its content as a result had she had doubts about the exact scope of the provision in question she could have refrained from publishing the article see mutatis mutandis karapetyan and others cited above it seems that she has not pursued the aforementioned avenue in the light of the above the court is of the opinion that article of the code was formulated sufficiently clearly in order to fulfil the requirements of precision and foreseeability under article of the convention the court therefore concludes that the impugned interference was prescribed by law in addition it accepts that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and reputation of others and of maintaining the authority of the judiciary within the meaning of article see paragraph above what remains to be determined therefore is whether the interference was necessary in a democratic societyc whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society the court reiterates the general principles set out in its caselaw concerning the necessity of an interference with freedom of expression the maintenance of the authority of the judiciary and the freedom of expression of judges see morice v france gc no echr and baka v hungary gc no june turning to the present case the court notes that the applicant published the impugned article under her own name with her title as a judge attached to the bucharest court of appeal alongside it see paragraph above therefore in examining the interference in question the court will attach particular importance to the position held by the applicant her statements and the context in which they were made see di giovanni v italy no july and baka cited above the court notes further that the ultimate aim of the applicants article was to raise questions about the role public prosecutors had had during the communist regime and about the aptness of a person who had occupied such a position for reforming a modern justice system and ensuring its proper functioning it appears that the applicant wrote the article in the context of a larger public debate about legislation concerning the lustration of the prosecution service see paragraphs and above and she focused her attention on the career of the president of the court of cassation at the time when she published her article namely judge lds who had worked as a prosecutor during communism the applicants article did not concern judge ldss private life but rather her professional activity and rise to the highest judicial position in the country see paragraph above in these circumstances the court takes the view that the applicants article concerned matters of general interest regarding the functioning and the reform of the justice system see morice cited above the court also notes that the applicants article concerned the professional activity of an officer of the court who may as such be subject to personal criticism within the permissible limits and not only in a theoretical and general manner see morice cited above and may be subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than ordinary citizens when acting in his or her official capacity ibid that was especially true when the judge or prosecutor in question was like in the instant case occupying a very visible public office namely that of president of the court of cassation bearing in mind the applicants position as a judge the court reiterates that it can be expected of public officials serving in the judiciary that they should show restraint in exercising their freedom of expression in all cases where the authority and impartiality of the judiciary are likely to be called in question baka cited above the judicial authorities are required to exercise maximum discretion and that discretion should dissuade them from making use of the press even when provoked it is the higher demands of justice and the elevated nature of judicial office which impose that duty see di giovanni cited above with further references it is important for the judiciary to enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties ibid as to the content of the impugned article the court notes that the national authorities held that the applicant had breached article of the code because of the intended meaning of her article and the expressions used in that article such as comrade prosecutor the president of all judges untouchable rising to root out the enemies of the socialist order and for the pursuit of the new man convict women for abortion all these comrades usurpers of christ and his law sternly guarded the communist prison and has accomplished so much as to become the president of all judges herself in addition they were of the view that her article had breached her duty of discretion moderation and restraint in presenting her opinions had put in doubt the moral and professional integrity of a fellow judge and that her statements had not been value judgments but conveyed specific aspects and a clear and unequivocal personal opinion concerning the moral and professional integrity of the president of the court of cassation they considered that the article may have caused a reasonable observer to doubt the moral and professional integrity of the person targeted by it had been detrimental to the reputation of the justice system and had tarnished the dignity of the position of judge and the independence and impartiality of the judiciary furthermore the applicant had not presented supporting evidence for her allegations see paragraphs above the court notes that the national authorities are in principle better placed than an international court to assess the intention behind impugned phrases and statements and in particular to judge how the general public would interpret and react to them see mutatis mutandis concerning a complaint under article of the convention about an alleged breach of the right to reputation jalbă v romania no february having regard to the balancing exercise carried out by the national authorities and the reasons advanced by them for their findings the court sees no reason to call their conclusion into question the court notes in this connection that the applicants article was mainly worded in the form of an account of her personal experiences during communism which did not concern lds directly and which included statements about activities carried out by prosecutors a category to which judge lds had belonged at the time as well as rhetorical questions concerning her professional activity and rise taking into account the overall tone and wording of the applicants article as well as the scope of the questions raised by her throughout the court agrees with the domestic authorities assessment that the article actually contained allegations of specific conduct by prosecutors in general and lds in particular specifically using the case files as weapons to root out the enemies of the socialist order and for the pursuit of the new man hunting down women who had been forced to abort their children usurping christ and his law and guarding sternly the communist prison detrimental to the remaining members of society her article therefore suggested to the public that lds had behaved in an immoral and unlawful manner and was likely to lead it to believe that the acts constituting the conduct of which lds was accused by the applicant were established and incontrovertible facts the court notes however that none of the information relied on by the applicant in her submissions including the historical truth the relevant legislation at that time and the notoriety of the fact that the legislation in force during the communist regime had breached human rights see paragraphs and above appears to support the suggestion that lds had committed any acts of the nature imputed by the applicant either at the time when she had been working as prosecutor or after she had become a judge also it would appear that the legislation concerning the lustration of the prosecution service was declared unconstitutional by the constitutional court see paragraph above under these circumstances the court is satisfied that the reasons given by the national authorities and the domestic courts in carrying out a balancing exercise between the competing rights at stake were relevant or sufficient given the absence of a sufficiently accurate factual basis for the applicants statements the court agrees with the national authorities findings that in that context and as a judge the applicant should have been aware and mindful of the risks involved in publishing her article and the impact it could have had see paragraphs and above both on judge ldss professional life and on the authority of the judiciary what remains to be examined is the proportionality of the penalty as to the consequences of the codeofconduct proceedings for the applicant the court notes that it did not entail any concrete and imminent loss of judicial office or any pecuniary penalty for her it is true that the government have not disputed that the decision in the codeofconduct proceedings was permanently included in her professional file and would be taken into account in her professional appraisal for which seems to be still pending also during the competition for promotion to the court of cassation the ij relied on the aforementioned decision when it produced its negative report concerning the applicants professional integrity which suggests that the impugned penalty was relevant and affected the assessment of the applicants applications for promotions see paragraphs above the court notes however that the ij did not take into account only the codeofconduct penalty when it produced its negative report of april concerning the applicant see paragraph above also the applicant has accepted that the penalty in question taken on its own would not automatically prevent her from applying for a promotion to the court of cassation in the foreseeable future see paragraph above moreover it does not seem that the applicant was prevented by the penalty either from applying to participate or from actually participating in the promotion competitions see paragraph above but she nevertheless decided to withdraw the court takes note of the reasons put forth by the applicant for her decision to withdraw from the competition see paragraph above given the findings above the court is not however prepared to speculate on the possible outcome of this or any future competitions or whether the decision finding that the applicant had breached article of the code would result on its own in her automatic disqualification or dismissal from competitions reiterating its view on the chilling effect that a fear of sanction may have on the exercise of freedom of expression see for instance wille v liechtenstein gc no echr vii nikula v finland no echr ii and elci and others v turkey nos and november the court is of the view that even if the decision taken in the codeofconduct proceedings may have had a certain chilling effect on the exercise of the applicant freedom of expression the decision was not excessive in the circumstances of the present case see mutatis mutandis antonescu v romania no february and di giovanni cited above in the light of the foregoing and the particular importance it attaches to the position held by the applicant the court considers that the domestic authorities struck a fair balance between the need to protect the authority of the judiciary and the reputation or rights of others on the one hand and the need to protect the applicants right to freedom of expression on the other the interference was thus necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention the courts finding is without prejudice to the applicants decision to pursue to the end the administrative proceedings she had initiated against the csm seeking to have article of the code struck down see paragraphs above if successful given judge gbs experience with similar proceedings and above it seems that they could give the applicant the opportunity to have the penalty imposed on her annulled and removed from her professional file there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention other alleged violations of the convention relying on article of the convention taken jointly with article and on article of protocol no to the convention the applicant complained that she had been discriminated against by the relevant authorities because as an ordinary judge she had been punished for her statements which had not been serious while the head prosecutor of the national anticorruption department had not been punished at all for violent and defamatory statements concerning the activities of several magistrates that he had identified expressly or who had been easily identifiable the court has examined the complaint as submitted by the applicant however having regard to all the material in its possession and in so far as it falls within its jurisdiction the court finds that it does not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the convention or its protocols it follows that this part of the application must be rejected as being manifestly illfounded pursuant to article and of the convention for these reasons the court unanimouslydeclares the complaint under article of the convention concerning the alleged breach of the applicants right to freedom of expression admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified

54,the first applicant company axel springer se is a publishing house operated in the legal form of a societas europea registered in berlin the second applicant company rtl television gmb h is a broadcasting company set up as a private limited company registered in cologne on june the defendant s then aged was arrested the public prosecutors office charged him with killing his parents dismembering their bodies burning some of the parts flushing others down the toilet and disposing of the rest by putting them in barrels s confessed to the police several german newspapers reported on the case some published pictures of s which mostly showed him at a much younger age the public prosecutors office obtained a psychiatric expert opinion in october the expert concluded that s was suffering from a schizoid personality disorder at the time when he had committed the offence the trial against s began on january at the potsdam regional court photographers working for the applicant companies attended the hearings to take still photographs and make videorecordings of the defendant prior to the start of the hearing the presiding judge informed the photojournalists orally that the defendants face would have to be made unidentifiable in the usual manner before any images of him were published according to the applicant companies the presiding judge had indicated at the beginning of the hearing on january that anyone who failed to comply with this order no longer needed to show himself at the regional court of potsdam and apply for permission to take photos of future proceedings the applicant companies submitted a copy of an email of a journalist who attended the hearing confirming the alleged statement of the presiding judge the government contested the applicant companies assertions that the presiding judge had threatened not only to bar journalists from taking photographs during the proceedings against the defendant but also from future proceedings before the potsdam regional court the government submitted that according to the presiding judge no such statement had been made s repeated his confession on the first day of the hearing by a letter of january the second applicant company asked the president of the regional court to change the presiding judges oral order it pointed out inter alia that several unpixelated pictures of s had been published in different newspapers before by a letter of the same date the president replied that he had forwarded the letter to the presiding judge for lack of competence on january the presiding judge supplemented his order and provided his reasons in writing the only media representatives who were permitted to take photographs and make videorecordings of s were those who had previously registered with the court and given an assurance that prior to the publication or forwarding of the material the face of s would be disguised by a technical process for example by pixelisation so that it would only be possible to use the images in such a form journalists were barred from further reporting on the case if they failed to comply with the order the presiding judge stated in his reasons that he had to balance the public interest in being informed and the personality rights of s he acknowledged that the crime at issue was very different from usual crimes and that permitting only pictures that disguised s impaired the publics ability to be informed however he held that the order was justified in view of the need to protect the personality rights of s he reasoned that it was unlikely that the case had caused a sensation throughout germany no nationwide television channel besides the second applicant had shown any interest in reporting on it he stressed the importance of the presumption of innocence finding that reporting on s in a way which identified him could have a pillory effect consequently according to the presiding judge the personality rights of s who had never been in the public eye or sought to contact the media and who had expressly requested that his identity be concealed outweighed the public interest in being informed furthermore the order had already proved to be necessary as there had been individual violations of the judges instructions following the first day of the hearing on january the presiding judge sent the supplemented written order to a number of journalists including some who worked for the applicant companies on january the applicant companies filed an objection gegenvorstellung requesting the suspension of the judicial order banning the publication of images enabling identification during the proceedings against s für die dauer des prozesses gegen s the applicant companies stressed the fact that s had confessed to the crime on the first day of the hearing on february the presiding judge upheld the order he held that the implications of the confession and its credibility could only be assessed at the end of the hearing further hearings took place on and january and on february on february the regional court delivered its verdict sentencing the defendant to prison on two counts of murder on february the federal constitutional court declined to consider a constitutional complaint by the applicant companies without providing reasons no bv r ii relevant domestic law and practicea legal provisions the courts act gerichtsverfassungsgesetz sets out provisions on reporting on court hearings and on judges powers to issue orders to ensure their proper conduct the relevant provisions read as follows section hearings before the adjudicating court including the pronouncement of judgments and rulings shall be public audio television or radio recordings as well as audio and film recordings intended for public presentation or publication are not permitted section the presiding judge is responsible for maintaining order at hearings section parties accused persons witnesses experts or persons not participating in a hearing who fail to follow orders given to maintain order can be removed from the courtroom or taken into detention and held for a determined period of time such a period may not exceed twentyfour hours decisions on measures pursuant to the first sentence in respect of persons who are not participants in the hearing shall be made by the presiding judge and in all other cases by the court b caselaw of the federal constitutional court the federal constitutional court established in a decision of december no bv r on videorecording in criminal proceedings that based on section of the courts act a presiding judge can impose restrictions inter alia on the taking of photographs and making videorecordings in doing so the presiding judge has to balance the public interest in being informed and the personality rights of the defendant giving consideration to the circumstances of the case an essential criterion is the gravity of the offence at stake and special circumstances which may cause a rise in public interest it noted that the public interest weighed more when the gravity of the offence clearly differed from acts of common criminality that applied even if the defendant had never been in the public eye before as to a defendants personality rights account had to be taken of the fact that criminal proceedings caused an unusual and burdensome situation which could not be avoided as attendance at them was mandatory in particular in respect of defendants a possible pillory effect or implications on the presumption of innocence andor later social rehabilitation had to be considered the federal constitutional court has decided on several applications for interim relief concerning judicial orders banning the publication of pictures andor photographic journalism in which a defendant could be identified the decisions stressed that the presumption of innocence meant that reports on criminal proceedings which included photographs had in general to be restrained and at the very least very balanced the nature and gravity of the offence at issue might not only cause a higher level of public interest but also a higher risk of the stigmatisation of the defendant decision of november no bv q a confession by a defendant might impact the balancing process decision of december no bv r as could a possible lack of criminal responsibility due to mental health problems decision of march no bv r in a decision of september the federal constitutional court has further found that an order to pixelate pictures largely respected the public interest in information no bv r iii recommendation by the committee of ministers of the council of europe the appendix to the recommendation rec of the committee of ministers of the council of europe to member states on the provision of information through the media in relation to criminal proceedings adopted by the committee of ministers on july at the th meeting of the ministers deputies contains the following principles of particular interest to the present case principle protection of privacy in the context of ongoing criminal proceedings the provision of information about suspects accused or convicted persons or other parties to criminal proceedings should respect their right to protection of privacy in accordance with article of the convention particular protection should be given to parties who are minors or other vulnerable persons as well as to victims to witnesses and to the families of suspects accused and convicted in all cases particular consideration should be given to the harmful effect which the disclosure of information enabling their identification may have on the persons referred to in this principle principle live reporting and recordings in court rooms live reporting or recordings by the media in court rooms should not be possible unless and as far as expressly permitted by law or the competent judicial authorities such reporting should be authorised only where it does not bear a serious risk of undue influence on victims witnesses parties to criminal proceedings juries or judges the law alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant companies complained that the judicial order banning the publication of images by which s could be identified had violated their right to freedom of expression as provided in article of the convention which reads so far as relevant as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or rights of others a admissibility the court observes that the applicant companies raised their complaint in substance before the domestic courts and that it is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissionsa the government the government stated that the presiding judges order had been based on section of the courts act it had been the presiding judges duty to issue instructions to maintain order at the court hearing which also included ensuring the personality rights of s and other parties involved article of the convention had not been violated as the presiding judge had maintained a fair balance between the interests affected he had taken account to a sufficient degree of the public interest in being informed and had been entitled to give precedence to the interests of s in view of the circumstances of the case it had been obvious that the reports on the proceedings against s had focused primarily on satisfying public demand for sensationalist stories about the gruesome details of the crime the restriction on publishing images of s had been justified s had been utterly unknown to the public he had merited an increased degree of protection against reporting as he suffered from a psychiatric disorder as established by a psychiatric report in october the government emphasised that the pictures taken in the courtroom had shown s in handcuffs next to police officers or his defence lawyer disseminating pictures of that kind where he could be identified would have increased the pressure on him his interests could not be given less weight in view of his confession on the first day of the hearing bearing in mind the importance of the presumption of being innocent until proven guiltyb the applicant companies the applicant companies argued that the court order had had no legal basis in section of the courts act according to the applicant companies the domestic courts had failed in the present case to recognise the importance of the public interest in being informed and to balance the interests in question properly the very unusual circumstances of the crime at issue had attracted an enormous amount of public interest which had not been limited to mere curiosity but had also involved issues such as the role of the parents of s in the family conflict the domestic courts had ignored the fact that s had become known to the public by virtue of the crime he had committed as to the presumption of innocence the domestic courts had not paid enough attention to the fact that s had not only made a confession on the first day of the hearing but also previously during the investigation with regard to the presiding judges assumption that s had needed particular protection it had to be noted that the judge had nonetheless not taken any protective procedural measures such as closing the proceedings to the public since the court had ordered that pictures of s had to conceal his identity by technical means the judicial ban had gone considerably beyond the requirements needed for the protection of the presumption of innocence the applicant companies highlighted that article of the convention not only protected the substance of information and ideas but also the form in which it was conveyed the courts assessment the court notes and the parties agreed that the judicial order given in the present case had constituted an interference with the applicant companies right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the convention such interference contravenes the convention if it does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph of article it therefore falls to be determined whether the interference was prescribed by law pursued one or more of the legitimate aims in that paragraph and was necessary in a democratic society for that aim or aimsa prescribed by law the court reiterates that the relevant national law must be formulated with sufficient precision to enable the persons concerned if need be with appropriate legal advice to foresee to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances the consequences which a given action may entail see news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i it has however acknowledged the fact that frequently laws are framed in a manner that is not absolutely precise see satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june and markt intern verlag gmb h and klaus beermann v germany november series a no the court notes that the wording of section of the courts act lacks precision to a certain degree stating that the presiding judge is responsible for maintaining order at hearings thereby giving presiding judges broad discretion the court acknowledges that in light of the varied situations that presiding judges face in proceedings it is impossible to establish precise requirements for the measures to take in order to maintain the proper conduct of hearings in every individual case furthermore in the context of restrictions on reports using photographs in criminal proceedings the aforementioned provision has been subject to interpretation by the federal constitutional court which has elaborated criteria for presiding judges for the balancing of interests see paragraphs above the role of adjudication vested in the national courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as may remain satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above accordingly the court is satisfied that the interference was prescribed by lawb legitimate aim it is not in dispute that the judicial order served to protect the personal rights of s in the context of the trial in the course of which he was to be presumed innocent until proved guilty the court notes that the judicial order therefore pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of othersc necessary in a democratic societyi general principles the court refers to the general principles set forth in its caselaw for assessing the necessity of an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression which have been recently summarised in bédat v switzerland gc no echr and couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no november the court has emphasised the essential role played by the press in a democratic society and in particular its duty to impart information and ideas on all matters of public interest this duty extends to the reporting and commenting on court proceedings which contribute to their publicity and are thus consonant with the requirement under article of the convention that hearings be public it is inconceivable that there can be no prior or contemporaneous discussion of the subject matter of trials be it in specialised journals in the general press or amongst the public at large not only do the media have the task of imparting such information and ideas the public also has a right to receive them axel springer ag v germany gc no february furthermore it is not for the court any more than it is for the national courts to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what techniques of reporting should be adopted in a particular case axel springer ag cited above however the court has also underlined that the press must not overstep certain bounds regarding in particular the protection of the right to privacy of accused persons in criminal proceedings and the presumption of innocence bédat cited above egeland and hanseid v norway no april eerikäinen and others v finland no february the fact that everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right under article of the convention to be presumed innocent until proved guilty is of relevance for the balancing of competing interests which the court must carry out see news verlags gmb h co kg cited above lastly the court reiterates that the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity and scope of any interference in the freedom of expression protected by article of the convention in particular when a balance has to be struck between conflicting private interests bédat cited above where the national authorities have weighed up the interests at stake in compliance with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw strong reasons are required if it is to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see mgn limited v the united kingdom no and january axel springer ag cited above where the right to freedom of expression is being balanced against the right to respect for private life the criteria laid down in the courts case law have to be taken into account couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above axel springer ag v germany cited above the court considers that the criteria thus defined are not exhaustive and should be transposed and adapted in the light of the particular circumstances of the case compare satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above this applies in particular to cases where the presumption of innocence under article of the convention comes into play see mutatis mutandis bédat cited above the court has identified as far as relevant for the present case the following criteria in the context of balancing competing rights the contribution to a debate of public interest the degree to which the person affected is known the influence on the criminal proceedings the circumstances in which the photographs were taken the content form and consequences of the publication as well as the severity of the sanction imposedii application to the present caseα the contribution to a debate of public interest the court has stressed the contribution made by photographs in the press to a debate of general interest news verlags gmb h co kg cited above et seq and eerikäinen and others v finland cited above depending on the degree of notoriety of the person concerned and the nature of the crime the public might have an interest in having someones physical appearance disclosed see mutatis mutandis österreichischer rundfunk v austria no december the court acknowledges that there may be good reasons for prohibiting the publication of a suspects image depending on the nature of the offence at issue and the particular circumstances of the case the crime at issue was brutal but had been committed within a family following a private dispute and in a domestic setting there were no indications that it had gained particular notoriety at the very beginning of the proceedings when the judicial ban was ordered media interest in the case had been rather limited as pointed out by the presiding judge and stressed by the government the court agrees with the domestic courts assessment that there was a limited degree of public interest in the case the judicial order at issue did not restrict the content of reporting but concerned the publication of images by which s could be identified therefore the question arising here is whether the publication of such images was capable of contributing to the public debate on the case the court does not consider that information on ss physical appearance could have contributed significantly to the debate on the case in particular as there was no notoriety furthermore there is no indication that ss physical appearance could have contributed to the assessment of issues such as the role of ss parents in the family conflictβ the degree to which the person affected was known the court notes that s was undoubtedly not a public figure but an ordinary person who was the subject of criminal proceedings the public became aware of s for the first time as a consequence of the crime he had committed the fact that he was the subject of criminal proceedings albeit for a very serious offence can not deprive him entirely of the protection of article of the convention bédat cited above and eerikäinen and others cited above the fact that someones picture has already appeared in an earlier publication might be considered in the balancing process axel springer ag cited above and österreichischer rundfunk cited above and lead to the conclusion that there was no need to restrict the disclosure of an identity egeland and hanseid cited above the court notes that the presiding judge did not take into account previously published photographs of s considering the particular circumstances in which the judge issued the order namely the point in time at the very beginning of the court hearing and the necessary promptness of the decisionmaking process he could not be expected to know of all prior publications at that time and consider them when balancing the competing interests the court observes that ss physical appearance was known to the public as a consequence of the prior publications however most of the pictures of s published prior to the criminal proceedings had apparently been taken many years before and showed him at a much younger age in this regard it must also be borne in mind that until then the german press had only occasionally reported on the case with coverage basically limited to local media as pointed out by the government therefore at the time of the proceedings against him these pictures would not have enabled the public to identify s and his identity can not be said to have been already known to the publicγ the influence on the criminal proceedings the court notes that s had confessed to the crime twice and that according to the applicant companies see paragraph above therefore he would no longer have benefitted from the presumption of innocence however a confession in itself does not remove the protection of the presumption of innocence according to article of the convention everyone charged with a criminal offence must be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law the court acknowledges that a confession might under certain circumstances have an impact on the balancing of the competing rights as the federal constitutional court observed no bv r see paragraph above however in the present case the court is satisfied that the presiding judge took into consideration the fact that ss declarations and their credibility had to be assessed at the end of the main hearing according to the domestic law and not before it began this applies all the more as s suffered from a schizoid personality disorder according to a psychiatric expert report obtained by the prosecutors office the criminal court had to review carefully the confession in order to satisfy itself that it was accurate and reliableδ the circumstances in which the photographs were taken the court has regard to the fact that images of an accused taken in a court room may show the person in a state of great distress and possibly in a situation of reduced selfcontrol see mutatis mutandis egeland and hanseid cited above the photographs of s taken at the beginning of the hearing showed him in the courtroom in handcuffs next to police officers or his defense under these circumstances s had no means to protect his privacy and to prevent journalists from obtaining images by which he could be identified he did not voluntarily expose himself to the public but was forced to attend the hearing the court finds that under the given circumstances there was a strong need to protect ss privacy the court notes moreover that s never sought to contact the media nor make any public comments quite the reverse he expressly asked to be protected from reporting which identified him s did not consent to the taking of photographsε the content form and consequences of the publication the court order concerns the publication of images taken during the hearing by which s could be identified as pointed out by the government disseminating images showing s in the courtroom from which he could be identified would have increased the psychological pressure on him the court notes that particular consideration should be given to the harmful effect which the disclosure of information enabling the identification of suspects accused or convicted persons or other parties to criminal proceedings may have on these persons see principle of the appendix to the recommendation rec of the committee of ministers of the council of europe see paragraph above likewise it has to be considered that a publication of images in which a defendant could be identified may have negative implications on a later social rehabilitation if convicted as the federal constitutional court pointed out no bv r see paragraph above in the present case it was also in the interest of safeguarding due process not to increase the psychological pressure on s in particular in view of his personality disorderζ the scope of the order and the severity of the sanction the material scope of the judicial order was limited to a ban on the publication of images from which s could be identified as to the temporal scope of the judicial order the applicant companies submitted that the presiding judge had stated on january that anyone who failed to comply with his order would no longer have the right to take photographs prior to the commencement of proceedings they had concluded that the threat applied not only to the proceedings in question but had to be considered as a general ban for the future the court is not convinced by the applicants argument that the judicial order could have an effect reaching beyond the firstinstance hearing the reasons given in the order explicitly refer to orders on reporting on the main hearing anordnung hinsichtlich der bildberichterstattung über die hauptverhandlung in their objection of january see paragraph above the applicant companies themselves objected to a ban on reporting enabling identification during the proceedings against s für die dauer des prozesses gegen s in view of the written version of the judicial order of january and given that the presiding judges competence was limited to the hearing at issue under section of the courts act there is no support for the applicant companies allegation that the scope of the order went beyond the proceedings against s the court notes that the judicial order was not a particularly severe restriction on reporting the taking of images as such was not limited the order banned merely the publication of images from which s could be identified any other reporting on the proceedings was not restricted thus the presiding judge chose the least restrictive of several possible measures in order to safeguard due process and protect ss privacy as regards the consequences of a breach of the court order the potential barring from further reporting on the case was equally limited to the proceedings against s the court does not consider that the order had a chilling effect on the applicant companies contrary to their rights under article of the conventionη conclusion the court recognises the careful balancing act carried out by the presiding judge considering the various factors that are relevant under the convention having regard to the criteria and considerations stated above in particular the fact that the case concerned the publication of images taken in a criminal court hearing the court finds that the presiding judge clearly addressed the conflict between opposing interests and applied the domestic legal provision by carefully weighing the relevant aspects of the case in view of the margin of appreciation available to the national authorities in the context of restrictions on reporting on criminal proceedings the court is satisfied that the presiding judge balanced the interests involved in conformity with convention standards the order was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued as the presiding judge chose the least restrictive of several possible measures consequently the court concludes that the interference with the applicant companies right to freedom of expression was necessary in a democratic society accordingly there has been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rules of court milan blaško andré potocki deputy registrar president,,,
55,in and lives in berlin he is a journalist with bild a daily newspaper with a large circulation he was represented by mr c partsch a lawyer practising in berlin the government were represented by two their agents ms k behr and mr hj behrens of the federal ministry of justice the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows background and scope of the case upon the reunification of germany the judges and public prosecutors who had worked in the former german democratic republic were given the opportunity to apply to be integrated into the judiciary of the new länder background checks were performed on all candidates including with the federal commissioner responsible for examining the documents of the state security service of the former gdr bundesbeauftragter für die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ddr the federal commissioner some judges and public prosecutors who had collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security were integrated into the brandenburg judiciary because their collaboration was deemed not to have been so severe that it called into question their suitability for office in total less than half of the nearly three hundred judges and slightly more than half of the approximately two hundred public prosecutors who had worked in brandenburg in november were integrated into the judiciary of the land of brandenburg in reunified germany in and a member of parliament of the land of brandenburg submitted several questions to the brandenburg government concerning the collaboration of certain members of the brandenburg judiciary with the ministry of state security of the former gdr the minister of justice of the land of brandenburg stated that there were thirteen judges and one public prosecutor for whom there were indications that they had collaborated with the ministry of state security nine of those judges were serving in ordinary courts while four were serving in specialised courts the minister stated that the indications as to their collaborative involvement had been known when the decisions to integrate them into the judiciary of the land of brandenburg or their lifetime appointment had been taken the minister of justice subsequently declared that nine of the thirteen judges had performed their military service with the felix dzerzhinsky guards regiment affiliated with the ministry of state security while the four others had been secret informants informelle mitarbeiter as had the public prosecutor the background to the case and its procedural history notably the proceedings for interim measures before the domestic courts by which the applicant sought to obtain certain information on the thirteen judges and the public prosecutor are described in detail in the courts decision on the applicants previous application see saure v germany dec no august that application which had been lodged on december against the decisions taken by the domestic courts in the proceedings for interim measures was considered premature by the court and declared inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remedies because the applicants constitutional complaint concerning the main proceedings was still pending before the federal constitutional court ibid the present application was lodged in respect of the main proceedings following the rejection of that constitutional complaint proceedings at issue on august the applicant lodged an application for disclosure of the following information against the land of brandenburg with the potsdam administrative court which corresponded verbatim to the request he had made and continued to pursue in the then ongoing proceedings for interim measures see saure cited above no i what incriminating findings are available against the thirteen judges and the public prosecutor who are still serving at presentii what are the names of the thirteen judges where are they currently servingiii what is the name of the public prosecutor where is he currently servingiv which of the thirteen judges are currently dealing with or have dealt with in the last twentyone years proceedings concerning wrongful

proceedings ddr rehabilitierungsverfahren by a decision of october the berlin brandenburg administrative court of appeal in the proceedings for interim measures brought by the applicant see saure

with proceedings concerning restitution of property under the property act or proceedings governed by the criminal rehabilitation act strafrechtliches rehabilitierungsgesetz it dismissed the remainder of the applicants appeal on december the brandenburg ministry of justice disclosed the following information of the nine judges serving in ordinary courts four were serving at a district court four served in a regional court and one served in a court of appeal four judges dealt with civil cases four dealt with criminal cases and one dealt with both civil and criminal matters the four judges serving in specialised courts dealt with administrative law labour law and social law and were all serving at courts of first instance subsequently this disclosure was supplemented by a statement that of these four judges two were serving at administrative courts one sat in a labour court and one sat in a social court six of the thirteen judges had previously been involved in restitution proceedings under the property act or proceedings governed by the criminal rehabilitation act in the main proceedings before the potsdam administrative court leading to the present application both parties subsequently declared part of the matter resolved notably in respect of part of the applicants fourth question resulting in the discontinuation of the proceedings in this regard the applicants

servingiv which of the thirteen judges concerned are currently dealing with or have previously dealt with proceedings concerning wrongful acts committed by the gdr verfahren zur aufarbeitung von ddrunrecht the administrative court dismissed the application for disclosure it reproduced the reasoning of the administrative court of appeals decision of october in its entirety in so far as that court had dismissed the applicants appeal see paragraph above endorsed it and added some considerations as to the balancing exercise it had performed itself as to the first question of the applicants information request the administrative court considered that he was not entitled to disclosure of the information sought that is to say incriminating findings in respect of the thirteen judges and one public prosecutor who were currently serving in the brandenburg judiciary and for whom there were indications that they had previously collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security firstly while the prerequisites for a request under section of the brandenburg press act see paragraph below were met he could not base a request on that provision because the provisions of the stasi records act gesetz über die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen deutschen demokratischen republik were lex specialis where the disclosure sought concerned records of the state security service of the former gdr first sentence of section and first sentence of section of the stasi records act see paragraph below this conclusion was confirmed by section of the stasi records act according to which personal information transmitted by the federal commissioner could as a rule only be used for the purposes for which it had been transmitted see paragraph below in the present case this purpose was assessing whether the individuals concerned could be integrated into the brandenburg judiciary there was no exemption from that rule that would allow disclosure of such information to the press secondly the applicant could not rely on sections and of the stasi records act see paragraph below irrespective of whether the requirements of those provisions were met as such a request would be directed against the federal commissioner rather than the land of brandenburg thirdly the applicant had failed to prove that he was entitled to disclosure of the information under the brandenburg information act brandenburgisches akteneinsichts und informationsgesetz see paragraph below or article of the constitution of the land of brandenburg see paragraph below in any event the provisions of the stasi records act were also lex specialis in relation to claims under these provisions and prevented disclosure fourthly the applicant could not rely on the first sentence of article of the basic law see paragraph below as the right to freedom of information informationsfreiheit only gave a right to obtain information from sources that were intended to be generally accessible that was not the case with regard to the information sought by the applicant in so far as the applicant submitted that the law had changed and files held by the authorities were generally accessible following the entry into force of the federal freedom of information act informationsfreiheitsgesetz des bundes the court noted that the scope of the right to freedom of information under the basic law remained unaffected by this development a request based on the federal freedom of information act was in any event ruled out as the provisions of the stasi records act were lex specialis lastly the applicant was not entitled to disclosure of the requested information based on the freedom of the press guaranteed by the second sentence of article of the basic law which he had not even invoked since the scope of that right did not extend to the opening up of a source of information which was not generally accessible eröffnung einer informationsquelle as to the first part of the applicants second and third question regarding the names of the judges and public prosecutor the administrative court found that he was not entitled to disclosure of the requested information either the prerequisites for a request under section of the brandenburg press act were met but the respondent was entitled to refuse disclosure of the information in accordance with section of that act see paragraph below disclosure of the names would affect the right to protection of personality rights allgemeines persönlichkeitsrecht of the individuals concerned and their interests outweighed the interests of the applicant as a journalist and the public in disclosure of the names of the judges and public prosecutor for whom there were indications that they had previously collaborated with the ministry of state security of the former gdr despite the significance of the requested disclosure for the work of the press in a democratic society reiterating that there was no general rule that priority be accorded in the event of a conflict between the aforementioned constitutional rights the administrative court considered as regards the interests of the applicant as a journalist and the public in disclosure of the impugned information that a free and independent press was of particular significance in a democratic society to effectively exercise that role the press had to have in principle unlimited access to information including by obtaining access to sources of information that were not generally accessible in order to inform others the media first had to be informed themselves to that end they needed to have access to the internal workings of administrations and the processes taking place there it was in general for the press to evaluate and decide what it regarded as being information of public interest making use of the requested information was the editorial responsibility of the respective media outlet alone in which context the press could in general be trusted to be aware of its responsibility and to comply with the principles of the press code of conduct and the guidelines issued in that regard the mere possibility that a publication would violate personality rights was not sufficient for refusing the disclosure of information to the press it was evident that there was a public interest in disclosure of the names of the judges and public prosecutor for whom there were indications that they had previously collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security on the other hand the administrative court considered that disclosure would interfere with the right of the judges and public prosecutor to informational selfdetermination that is to say their authority to themselves decide when and within which boundaries facts and circumstances of their personal lives were to enter the public domain and would have severe consequences they would be stigmatised their work would be closely watched by the public and there was a risk that their current and past decisions would be subject to public criticism solely because they had previously collaborated with the ministry of state security of the former gdr their reputation could be harmed and they could possibly face hostile behaviour both in their professional and personal life as the matter concerned only fourteen people and the applicant worked as a journalist for a newspaper with a large circulation the potential publication of the individuals names could be expected to have a considerable impact moreover even though the individuals concerned held particularly important positions they had never sought public attention and had kept a low profile since being integrated into the brandenburg judiciary after the reunification of germany the information request did not concern professional conduct in relation to their current functions furthermore the potential collaboration with the ministry of state security of the former gdr which the persons concerned had not concealed when their applications had been assessed had occurred more than twenty years earlier and they had undergone background checks by the committees for the selection of judges and public prosecutors these committees had examined applications on a casebycase basis assessing the nature and scope of the collaboration with the ministry of state security the severity of the harm that could have been caused the reasons for the commencement and discontinuation of the collaboration the age of the person concerned as well as the intended function within the judiciary in accordance with the relevant guidelines persons whose collaboration with the gdr ministry of state security had exceeded the official duties imposed on them had not been appointed to the brandenburg judiciary whether or not it was reasonable that an individual be part of public service had been determined based on his or her function within the gdr ministry of state security and his or her conduct after the end of the collaboration in the select cases in which judges and public prosecutors had been integrated into the brandenburg judiciary despite indications or evidence of their prior collaboration with the gdr ministry of state security such collaboration had been determined as not to have been so severe that it opposed their integration into the brandenburg judiciary that decision taken by the land of brandenburg more than twenty years earlier placed the land as the employer under an obligation not to disclose their identity at least if there was no professional misconduct as to the second part of his second and third question regarding where the judges and public prosecutor were serving the administrative court found that the applicant was not entitled to disclosure of more information than what he had already received it essentially relied on the consideration that depending on where the individuals concerned served it was likely that they would be identified even if the information were disclosed in an anonymised form given the small number of judges and public prosecutors working in certain places this would notably be the case if the public prosecutor were employed at the brandenburg prosecutor generals office in view of the information released so far and the wording of the applicants information request the public prosecutor was male and there were only eight male public prosecutors at that office who could be concerned against this background the applicant was not entitled to know whether the individual concerned worked at the prosecutor generals office or at one of the four public prosecutors offices in brandenburg for similar considerations it was not possible to disclose where the judges concerned were currently serving while ensuring their anonymity if they served at one of the courts with a small number of judges it was likely that they would be identified also bearing in mind additional aspects which could lead to their identification such as their age or whether they had been citizens of the gdr as regards the applicants fourth question as presented to the administrative court at the time of its judgment that is limited to the question of which of the thirteen judges concerned had previously dealt with or were currently dealing with proceedings concerning wrongful acts committed by the gdr see paragraph above the administrative court endorsed the reasoning of the administrative court of appeal in its decision of october see paragraph above which had found that this request was too vague as it was not possible to determine on which types of proceedings the applicant sought to obtain information the administrative court added that the applicant was not entitled to receive the requested information under article of the convention either lastly there were no indications that his procedural rights including the right to a fair trial had been infringed by the fact that the judges concerned were serving in the brandenburg judiciary contrary to his allegation to that effect on january the applicant lodged a request for leave to appeal by an order of september the berlin brandenburg administrative court of appeal dismissed the applicants request for leave to appeal it rejected his submissions expressing doubts as to the correctness of the administrative courts judgment which related to the alleged wrongful application of domestic law the court of appeals decision was served on the applicants counsel on september in his constitutional complaint of october the applicant alleged a violation of his rights under the first and second sentence of article of the basic law his right to be heard and article of the convention by an order of december the federal constitutional court declined to accept the applicants constitutional complaint for adjudication no bv r without providing reasons the decision was served on the applicants counsel on december events outside the scope of the proceedings at issue on an undisclosed date the applicant turned to the federal commissioner he requested access to the records held and to be allowed to consult its files documenting the processing of the requests by the brandenburg ministry of justice no further information on the outcome of these requests was provided by the parties following another query by the applicant the authorities of the land of brandenburg provided him with the following information in july since december one judge had dealt with proceedings concerning restitution under the property act or proceedings governed by the criminal rehabilitation act three of the thirteen judges concerned had in the meantime retired relevant legal framework and practice article of the basic law reads in so far as relevant as follows article every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech writing and pictures and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources freedom of the press and freedom of reporting by means of broadcasts and films shall be guaranteed there shall be no censorship these rights shall find their limits in the

interests under sections and or other legal provisions contain sectorspecific regulations applicable to an unlimited group of persons section the obligation to comply with statutory confidentiality obligations to maintain professional secrecy or to protect special official secrets that are not based on statutory regulations shall remain unaffected section subject to the second sentence and subsections and an application to consult records shall be refused if this involves the disclosure of personal data unless the party directly affected has consented to the disclosure of the data or the disclosure is permitted by another legal provision the right to consult records may be granted in so far as on account of the particular circumstances of an individual case and in the light of the

pending proceedings may be frustrated or jeopardised regulations concerning the secrecy of such information preclude it an overriding public interest or private interests meriting protection would be violated or the scope of the information being sought exceeds what can reasonably be expected the provisions of the stasi records act gesetz über die unterlagen des staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen deutschen demokratischen republik read in so far as relevant as follows section the federal commissioner shall register store manage and use the records of the state security service in accordance with this act section governmental and nongovernmental bodies shall have access to the records and may only use them in accordance with this act if persons concerned third parties close

purposes according to the government in administrative practice the stasi records act does not in general rule out the disclosure of personal information by the bodies which have requested such information where this concerns for example a summary of the contents of the records this type of disclosure may under certain circumstances still be covered by the original purpose pursued by the transmission of the records in practice the body requesting such information for example a municipal representative body informs the public of the results achieved by the background checks for its institution and also states in a summary manner its assessment of the records the question of whether or not such a statement of position is permissible primarily concerns the legal relationship between the requesting body and the persons regarding whom a background check was performed with employers having a duty of care towards their employees under section of the courts constitution act gerichtsverfassungsgesetz a party to proceedings who suffers a disadvantage as a result of protracted proceedings is entitled to reasonable compensation a prior complaint of undue delay verzögerungsrüge which has to be raised before the same court is a prerequisite for a subsequent compensation claim in a committee of inquiry of the parliament of the land of brandenburg tasked with studying the history and managing the consequences of the dictatorship of the socialist unity party of the former gdr and the transition into a democratic state governed by the rule of law in the land of brandenburg aufarbeitung der geschichte und bewältigung von folgen der seddiktatur und des übergangs in einen demokratischen rechtsstaat im land brandenburg commissioned a study on the theme of human resources policy between continuity and change of elites from professor r will a law professor at humboldt university in berlin in professor will presented a report entitled human resources policy in the civil service of the land of brandenburg as exemplified by the staffing changes among judges and public prosecutors personalpolitik im öffentlichen dienst des landes brandenburg am beispiel des personellen umbruchs im bereich der richter und staatsanwälte to the committee of inquiry the report examined the situation of ninetyseven judges and seventyfive public prosecutors who had previously worked in the judiciary of the former gdr and who were still serving in the judiciary of the land of brandenburg at the time the report was written it concluded that the land of brandenburg had assessed the integration of judges and public prosecutors who had worked in the former gdr into the judiciary of the land of brandenburg on a casebycase basis and that there had been very limited flaws in the procedure grounds for excluding an individuals integration into the judiciary of the land of brandenburg had been applied in a consistent manner with relevant justifications provided in respect of the three cases in which deviations had been made it was ensured that all those who had systemically contributed to the politically motivated caselaw of gdr courts were excluded the report described in an anonymised form and by way of example individual cases of judges and public prosecutors who had been integrated into the judiciary of the land of brandenburg including excerpts from the files information provided by the federal commissioner minutes of interviews prior to their appointment decisions by the minister and records of the sessions of the committees for the selection of judges it contained information on the involvement of nine individuals with the gdr ministry of state security the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention about the domestic courts refusal to order the ministry of justice of the land of brandenburg to provide him with certain information he had requested concerning judges and a public prosecutor for whom there were indications that they had previously collaborated with the ministry of state security of the former gdr article of the convention in so far as relevant reads as follows article everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the parties submissionsa the government the government submitted that there had been no interference with the applicants rights under article of the convention his information request did not satisfy the criteria mentioned in magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no november notably the purpose of the request and the nature of the information sought criteria the domestic authorities had already made available most of the information which he had requested including information as to incriminating findings in respect of judges and public prosecutors who had been integrated into the judiciary the number of individuals concerned and the courts and levels of court at which the judges served and the fact that some of them with the specific number being provided had dealt with restitution or rehabilitation proceedings a public debate on the matter was possible based on that publicly available information the applicant had not indicated why the names of the individuals concerned were necessary for his research or of particular interest to the public the government added that the criteria mentioned in magyar helsinki bizottság were not exhaustive all circumstances of a given case had to be taken into account in the present case this included the consequences for the reputation of the individuals concerned in the event of disclosure of the requested informationb the applicant the applicant asserted that without being given access to the requested information he a wellknown journalist who had previously published articles on german history was unable to perform his role as a public watchdog he was prevented from adequately informing the public and contributing to a debate of paramount public interest which involved questions as to the integrity of judges and public prosecutors serving in the land of brandenburg and whether they had rendered improper decisions when assessing claims by victims of the former gdr concerning restitution rehabilitation and compensation the disclosure of certain information in an anonymised form had not satisfied his information request he needed to know the names of the individuals and where they served in order to do research concerning the decisions they had taken in particular in proceedings concerning restitution and rehabilitation of victims of the gdr regime the real reason why the authorities had not disclosed the requested information was that they were afraid of a scandal the courts assessment article does not confer on the individual a right of access to information held by a public authority or oblige the government to impart such information to the individual however such a right or obligation may arise where access to the information is instrumental for the individuals exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression in particular the freedom to receive and impart information and where its denial constitutes an interference with that right see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above in determining this question the court will be guided by the principles laid down in magyar helsinki bizottság ibid and will assess the case in the light of its particular circumstances and having regard to the following criteria a the purpose of the information request b the nature of the information sought c the role of the applicant and d whether the information was ready and available the court found that these threshold criteria are cumulative in saure v germany dec no october see also the references cited there turning to the question whether the applicant had a right of access to information in the present case the court notes that his role as a journalist was undeniably compatible with the scope of the right to solicit disclosure of stateheld information see magyar helsinki bizottság mikiashvili and others v georgia dec nos and january and saure no all cited above similarly it is not disputed that the impugned information was ready and available as regards the purpose of the request criterion and the question whether the nature of the information sought met the publicinterest test the court considers that the outcome of the assessment may vary in respect of the different aspects of information requested by the applicant that being said these criteria are satisfied at least in respect of some parts of his information request notably as regards the availability of incriminating findings against the thirteen judges and the public prosecutor for whom there were indications that they had collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security in the past and were currently serving in the brandenburg judiciary the court considers it appropriate to view the applicants information request in its entirety at the admissibility stage and to differentiate between its different parts when examining the proportionality of the refusal of the information requested in its assessment of the merits of the case including with respect to the weight attached to the consequences for the reputation of the individuals concerned in the event of disclosure of the requested information in sum the court is satisfied that the applicant a journalist wished to exercise the right to impart information on a matter of public interest and sought access to information to that end under article of the convention see also yuriy chumak v ukraine no march and šeks v croatia no february it follows that the governments objection as to compatibility ratione materiae with article of the convention must be dismissed the court further observes that the applicants complaint under article of the convention is neither manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention nor inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible merits the parties submissionsa the applicant in addition to his arguments summarised in paragraph above the applicant asserted that the authorities in brandenburg were known for retaining former staff of the gdr ministry of state security in public service the debate about biased judges serving in the brandenburg judiciary had begun right after and continued to the present day press coverage had played a vital part in starting a public debate on the matter his request had sought to find out who had been appointed to posts in the judiciary in spite of their involvement with the gdr ministry of state security and what their involvement had been in the absence of an opportunity to verify the information one could only hope that the appointment had been done based on an appropriate balancing of interests he needed to be provided with at least a summary of the incriminating findings contained in the records held by the federal commissioner which was not excluded by the stasi records act instead a balancing exercise of the competing interests was called for and the interest of the press in disclosure of that information outweighed that of the individuals concerned he could still publish the information in an anonymised form but doing so on a solid factual basis would shape public debate the applicant submitted that the information which had been disclosed in an anonymised form had not satisfied his information request he needed to know the names of the individuals and where they served in order to do research concerning the decisions they had taken in particular in proceedings concerning restitution and rehabilitation of victims of the gdr regime the authorities had a monopoly on the requested information he could not obtain it otherwise in such circumstances access to the information had to be granted to members of the press and withholding such information amounted to an act of censorship the real reason why the authorities had not disclosed the requested information was that they were afraid of a scandal the applicant alleged that the authorities had also attempted to hinder the preparation of the study commissioned by the parliamentary committee of inquiry referred to by the government the applicant submitted that he only intended to do research on the matter and that he had not yet decided whether he would eventually publish the names a twostep assessment was called for firstly whether the information was to be disclosed to the press and secondly whether the press was entitled to disclose the information the applicant emphasised that his research and any potential publications would concern the professional life of the individuals in the former gdr and in the brandenburg judiciary after german reunification it would not or at least not primarily concern their private life this was not a case of sensationalist reporting judges and public prosecutors were senior public officials who were always exposed to close public scrutiny information on previous collaboration with the gdr state security service did not warrant a particularly high level of protection and the interest of the individuals concerned in their reputation was outweighed by the overriding interest of the press in access to this information of general interest in fact disclosing the information at issue which related to doubts as to the integrity of judges and a public prosecutor would strengthen the authority of the judiciary it had to be borne in mind that the persons concerned would never reveal such information by themselves or recuse themselves from proceedings because of their past the requested information was also ready and available as to the fourth question of his information request the applicant alleged that the domestic courts had wrongfully considered the wording proceedings concerning wrongful acts committed by the gdr too vague besides various acts in the field of criminal law such as abuse of office violent acts at the intra german border perversion of justice or illtreatment of prisoners there were for example rehabilitation procedures under administrative law and those relating to professional lifeb the government the government maintained that even assuming that there had been an interference with the applicants article rights it had been lawful and the complaint was hence illfounded they emphasised that the domestic authorities had already made available most of the information which the applicant had requested referring to the report presented by professor will to the committee of inquiry of the land parliament they submitted that information as to incriminating findings in respect of judges and public prosecutors who had been integrated into the judiciary was publicly available that report described in detail in an anonymised form individual cases of judges and public prosecutors who had been integrated into the judiciary including excerpts from the files information provided by the federal commissioner minutes of interviews prior to their appointment decisions by the minister and records of the sessions of the committees for the selection of judges the report thus comprised information on the involvement of the individuals concerned with the gdr ministry of state security beyond that the number of individuals concerned had been disclosed as had the courts and levels of jurisdiction at which the judges served and the fact that some of them with the specific number being provided had dealt with restitution or rehabilitation proceedings a public debate on the matter was possible based on that publicly available information the applicant had not indicated why the names of the individuals concerned were necessary for his research or of particular interest to the public it appeared that his intention was to pillory the individuals concerned by publishing their names subjecting them to a blanket suspicion of having improperly exercised their official functions and sensationalist reporting that would humiliate them both in a professional and a private context this did not constitute a legitimate or weighty public interest by contrast it could have a severe negative impact on the individuals concerned they had a legitimate interest in nondisclosure of this information which was confidential in nature and had been reviewed when their integration into the judiciary had been assessed they were not public political figures by protecting the reputation of judges the measure complained of also served to maintain the authority of the judiciary the government explained that the legislature had adequately balanced the competing interests of the public in transparency and in coming to terms with political and historical circumstances on the one hand with those of rehabilitation and the need of the individuals concerned to have their article rights protected regarding any potential involvement they may have had in the past with the state security service of the former gdr on the other for that reason disclosure of personal information from the records held by the federal commissioner which was exclusively regulated by the stasi records act required either the consent of the individual concerned or a balancing exercise in which the right of the press to disclosure and the right to privacy were weighed against each other that act intended to enable victims of the dictatorship to learn whether they had been subjected to any measures of investigation and to assert claims for rehabilitation and compensation another aim of the act was to enable the authorities to vet candidates for public service by checking their backgrounds as to any involvement with the ministry of state security the documents held by the federal commissioner were not meant to be made accessible to the general public and narrow limits were set as to the right to consult them and to perform background checks in view of considerations relating to rehabilitation it was prohibited to use findings which had been obtained from these records in the context of background checks for other purposes the question of whether or not the applicant was entitled under section of the stasi records act to obtain disclosure of certain information from the federal commissioner was not relevant in the present case referring to the considerations put forward by the potsdam administrative court in its judgment of december see paragraphs above the government asserted that the domestic courts had thoroughly balanced the competing interests the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life in accordance with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw and in concluding that certain information was to be disclosed in an anonymised form and that in respect of certain other information the interests of the individuals concerned outweighed those of the public in obtaining the information had not overstepped their margin of appreciation where the balancing exercise had been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the court required strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts they referred to von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr there were no such strong reasons in the present case the thirdparty intervener the centre for democracy and rule of law argued in favour of interpreting article of the convention as a right of the press visàvis the authorities to be given access to information within a reasonable time this was necessary for the press to effectively fulfil its role as a public watchdog in relation to the authorities the courts assessment having regard to its above finding that the applicants information request viewed as a whole was compatible ratione materiae with article of the convention see paragraphs above the court considers that the domestic authorities refusal to provide the impugned information to the applicant interfered with his rights under article of the convention such an interference will be justified under article of the convention if it was prescribed by law pursued one or more legitimate aims set out in that provision and was necessary in a democratic society the impugned refusal of access to the files was in accordance with the law namely the first sentence of section and the first sentence of section of the stasi records act as well as section of the brandenburg press act see paragraphs and above the court can also accept that the impugned refusal pursued legitimate aims set out in article of the convention namely protecting the reputation of the judges and public prosecutor preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence and maintaining the authority of the judiciary the court has previously dealt with cases in which the denial of an information request pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of others see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above et seq and centre for democracy and the rule of law v ukraine no et seq march elements which the court considered in the proportionality assessment in those cases included i whether the individuals concerned by the information request were public figures of particular prominence ii whether they had themselves exposed the impugned information to close public scrutiny iii the degree of potential harm to the individuals privacy in the event of disclosure iv the consequences for the effective exercise of the applicants freedom of expression and v whether the applicant had put forward reasons for the information request see centre for democracy and the rule of law cited above as well as the degree of public interest in the matter see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above the interests to be balanced against the applicants interest in disclosure of the information are not limited to the rights of others see for example šeks v croatia no february and saure v germany no november both of which involved national security concerns and include maintaining the authority of the judiciary as set out in paragraph of article lastly the court reiterates that under article of the convention the contracting states enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed under that provision is necessary but that this margin goes hand in hand with european supervision see axel springer ag v germany gc no february and magyar helsinki bizottság cited above since the applicants information request concerned different pieces of information and that it was granted to varying degrees in respect of its different parts the court considers it appropriate to assess the proportionality of the refusal of the different parts of the information request separatelya names of the individuals concerned and their current place of service the court observes that the domestic authorities disclosed that of the thirteen judges concerned nine served in ordinary courts four judges were serving in a district court four served in a regional court and one served in a court of appeal four dealt with civil cases four dealt with criminal cases and one dealt with both civil and criminal matters the remaining four judges served in specialised courts of first instance two were serving in administrative courts one served in a labour court and one served in a social court see paragraph above at a later stage the authorities disclosed that three of the thirteen judges had since retired see paragraph above the administrative court dismissed the applicants information request regarding the disclosure of the names of the judges and public prosecutor as it determined that the individuals interests in nondisclosure outweighed the interests of the applicant as a journalist and the public in disclosure in arriving at that conclusion it considered i the role and significance of the press in a democratic society and the importance for members of the press to have access to information for the effective exercise of that role including by way of obtaining the disclosure of information that was not generally accessible such as the internal workings of administrations and the processes taking place there ii the public interest in the requested information iii that the disclosure concerned facts and circumstances of the personal lives of the individuals concerned and the severe consequences which the disclosure would have for the individuals concerned both in respect of their professional life where there was a risk that their current or past decisions would be subject to public criticism owing solely to their past collaboration with the gdr ministry of state security and in respect of their personal life iv that the individuals concerned held important public positions but had never sought public attention v that the information request did not concern the professional conduct of the individuals concerned in relation to their current functions vi that the potential collaboration with the gdr ministry of state security had occurred more than twenty years earlier and the individuals concerned had not concealed it when their applications for integration into judiciary of the land of brandenburg had been assessed and their collaboration with the gdr ministry of state security had been determined not to have been so severe that it opposed their integration into the brandenburg judiciary and vii that that decision taken by the land of brandenburg more than twenty years earlier placed the land as the employer of the individuals concerned under an obligation not to disclose their identity at least if there was no professional misconduct see paragraphs above reiterating that in exercising its supervisory function the courts task is not to take the place of the national courts but rather to review in the light of the case as a whole whether the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation are compatible with the provisions of the convention relied on see von hannover no cited above it considers that the domestic authorities examined a considerable number of elements when balancing the interests for and against disclosure of the names of the individuals concerned compare and contrast centre for democracy and the rule of law cited above and magyar helsinki bizottság cited above the court finds that the disclosure of their names would affect the judges and the public prosecutor concerned to such degree as to bring article of the convention into play see axel springer ag cited above it sees no reason to depart from the domestic authorities considerations in respect of the elements examined and considers that they put forward relevant reasons for the conclusion that the interests of the individuals in nondisclosure of their names outweighed those of the applicant journalist and the public in their disclosure the court moreover observes that a public debate on the matter the fact that thirteen judges and a public prosecutor for whom there were indications that they had collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security served in courts in the judiciary of the land of brandenburg was possible based on the information disclosed by the authorities without knowing the names of the individuals concerned see also georgian young lawyers association v georgia dec no january last but not least the court concurs with the domestic authorities that disclosing the names of the judges and public prosecutor could well result in their judicial decisions both past and present being criticised systematically in public noting that the domestic authorities established that there were no indications of professional misconduct on the part of the individuals concerned a finding which the court is not in a position to challenge such systematic public criticism of judicial decisions unrelated to the professional conduct of the judges or the public prosecutor concerned would not only constitute a severe consequence for the professional life of the individuals concerned but also for the authority of the judiciary as a whole see morice v france gc no echr these additional considerations weigh in favour of not disclosing the names of the individuals concerned and thus reinforce the conclusion reached by the domestic authorities in the light of the foregoing the court considers that the reasons put forward by the domestic authorities were not only relevant but also sufficient to show that the refusal to disclose the names of the judges and public prosecutor was necessary in a democratic society in refusing the requested disclosure of more detailed information about the place of service of the judges and public prosecutor the administrative court essentially relied on the consideration that the individuals could be identified if they happened to work in certain places where there was a small number of judges and public prosecutors even if the information were disclosed in an anonymised form see paragraph above having regard to the reasons advanced by the administrative court in this regard the court sees no reasons to depart from the finding as to the possibility or likelihood that the individuals concerned could be identified if their place of service were disclosed in the event of their identification the above considerations in respect of the refusal to disclose the names of the individuals concerned apply it follows that there has been no violation of article of the convention on account of the domestic authorities refusal to disclose the names and places of service of the thirteen judges and the public prosecutor for whom there were indications that they had collaborated with the gdr ministry of state securityb incriminating findings against the judges and public prosecutor the court notes that the authorities disclosed that nine of the thirteen judges had performed their military service with the felix dzerzhinsky guards regiment affiliated with the ministry of state security while the four others had been secret informants as had the public prosecutor see paragraph above moreover the report commissioned by and presented to the parliamentary committee of inquiry described in an anonymised form and by way of example individual cases of judges and public prosecutors who had previously worked in the judiciary of the former gdr and who had been integrated into the judiciary of the land of brandenburg including information on the involvement of some of the individuals concerned with the gdr ministry of state security see paragraph above the information thus made available at least to some extent allowed public debate on the matter see also georgian young lawyers association cited above that being said the court notes that the report commissioned by and presented to the committee of inquiry concerned first and foremost the procedure for the integration of judges and public prosecutors who had worked in the former gdr into the judiciary of the land of brandenburg and compliance with the relevant criteria it was thus tailored to provide answers to different questions than the applicants information request moreover the report contained information by way of example on the involvement of judges and public prosecutors with the gdr ministry only in relation to a small share of all cases reviewed see paragraph above and not necessarily in relation to the individuals concerned by the applicants information request seized of the applicants request for disclosure of information on the incriminating findings available against the thirteen judges and one public prosecutor for whom there were indications that they had previously collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security and who at the time of his request were still serving in the brandenburg judiciary the administrative court found that there was no legal basis to disclose the information sought in arriving at that conclusion the court examined the information request under a number of provisions of domestic law as regards some of those it considered that the applicant could not base his request on them because the provisions of the stasi records act were lex specialis at the same time a request could not be based on sections and of the stasi records act either as such a request would be directed against the federal commissioner rather than the land of brandenburg see also the governments submission at paragraph above that it was not relevant for the present case whether the applicant was entitled under section of the stasi records act to obtain disclosure of certain information from the federal commissioner it found that the applicant could also not rely on the right to freedom of information under the first sentence of article of the basic law as the information was not sought from sources that were intended to be generally accessible or on the freedom of the press under the second sentence of article of the basic law since the scope of that right did not extend to the opening up of a source of information which was not generally accessible see paragraphs above in as much as the administrative court addressed a considerable number of provisions on which an application for disclosure could in certain circumstances be based including some not invoked by the applicant the court can not but note that the administrative court did not engage at all in a balancing of competing interests in respect of this part of the applicants request for disclosure see also magyar helsinki bizottság cited above and and centre for democracy and the rule of law cited above the court is mindful of the governments submission that the competing interests had been balanced by the legislature and that in view of considerations relating to rehabilitation it was prohibited to use findings which had been obtained from the records held by the federal commissioner in the context of background checks for other purposes see paragraph above while such considerations pursue the legitimate aim of preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence the court also notes that according to the government in administrative practice the stasi records act does not in general rule out the disclosure of personal information by the bodies which have requested such information where this concerns for example a summary of the contents of the records see paragraph above such type of disclosure may under certain circumstances still be covered by the original purpose pursued by the transmission of the records see paragraph above the question whether such disclosure is permissible primarily concerns the legal relationship between the requesting body and the persons regarding whom a background check was performed with employers having a duty of care towards their employees see paragraph above the court reiterates that a right of access to information held by a public authority or an obligation on the government to impart such information to the individual may arise under article of the convention where access to information is instrumental for the individuals exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression in particular the freedom to receive and impart information and where its denial constitutes an interference with that right see paragraph above and magyar helsinki bizottság cited above such right or obligation may also arise in relation to information that is not and is not intended to be generally accessible see saure no et seq and šeks et seq both cited above in respect of classified information involving national security concerns even though the refusal of the requested access did not breach article in the specific circumstances of those cases a proportionality assessment taking into account all the relevant elements of a given case is required however in the present case the administrative court did not explain why the disclosure of the summary of the contents of the records transmitted by the federal commissioner was excluded in the present case see paragraphs and above it did not explain why the disclosure of additional and more detailed information in an anonymised form in respect of the collaboration of the thirteen judges and one public prosecutor with the gdr ministry of state security would necessarily run counter to the duty of care which the brandenburg authorities had towards the individuals concerned as their employees see paragraphs and above in this connection the court considers in particular that the performance of their current functions would not be called into question by such anonymised disclosure which did not allow for the identification of the individuals concerned at the same time the court considers that there was a significant public interest in knowing the nature and degree of collaboration by which persons still serving as judges and as a public prosecutor in the land of brandenburg at the time of the information request had collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security indeed the nature and degree of that collaboration may have varied considerably and can not be deduced from the information provided that the individuals had been secret informants or had served with the felix dzerzhinsky guards regiment see paragraph above the report commissioned by and presented to the committee of inquiry was tailored to provide answers to different questions than the applicants information request and contained by way of example information on the involvement of the individuals with the gdr ministry of state security only in relation to a small share of all cases reviewed see paragraphs and above in the light of the foregoing the court considers that by not examining whether the impugned information could be disclosed in an anonymised form which would have allowed the applicant journalist to contribute on a solid factual basis to a debate on a matter of general interest and by not engaging in a balancing of the competing interests at issue the domestic authorities failed to put forward relevant and sufficient reasons to show that the refusal to disclose additional information on the incriminating findings against the judges and public prosecutor was necessary in a democratic society see also magyar helsinki bizottság cited above there has accordingly been a violation of article of the convention in respect of this part of the applicants information requestc involvement of the judges concerned in certain types of proceedings the court observes the applicant initially requested information on the involvement of the thirteen judges concerned in proceedings concerning wrongful acts committed by the gdr andor with restitution proceedings under the property act andor gdr rehabilitation proceedings see paragraph above following the order by the berlin brandenburg court of appeal to disclose certain parts of the requested information see paragraph above the brandenburg ministry of justice revealed that six of the thirteen judges had previously been involved in restitution proceedings under the property act or proceedings governed by the criminal rehabilitation act see paragraph above both parties subsequently declared part of the matter resolved notably in respect of the applicants question concerning the judges involvement in certain types of proceedings resulting in the discontinuation of the proceedings in this regard see paragraph above the applicants request as presented before the administrative court at the time of its judgment of december read as follows see paragraph aboveiv which of the thirteen judges concerned are currently dealing with or have previously dealt with proceedings concerning wrongful acts committed by the gdr verfahren zur aufarbeitung von ddrunrecht it follows that the applicant can not complain before the court in a manner that meets the admissibility criteria about any refusal to provide him with information about the past or present involvement of any of the thirteen judges concerned in restitution proceedings under the property act or in proceedings governed by the criminal rehabilitation act since he himself declared the matter resolved before the administrative court all that he can complain about before the court is the refusal of his information request as presented by him before the administrative court that is which of the thirteen judges concerned was dealing with proceedings concerning wrongful acts committed by the gdr reiterating that applicants are required to substantiate their information requests if need be in the course of the domestic proceedings so as to put the domestic authorities in a position to engage in the necessary balancing of competing interests see saure no and and contrast centre for democracy and the rule of law both cited above the court can not but note that the berlin brandenburg court of appeal in its decision of october on the applicants request for interim measures found that this request was too vague as it was not possible to determine on which types of proceedings the applicant sought to obtain information see paragraph above despite being provided with this judicial guidance that he needed to specify which types of proceedings he was referring to the applicant did not respond to this call either in his submissions before the administrative court in the main proceedings during which he changed the wording of this specific question or in his subsequent submissions before the berlin brandenburg court of appeal and the federal constitutional court see saure cited above no and the references cited therein therefore the administrative court can not be reproached for concluding that this part of request was too vague as it was not possible to determine which types of proceedings he meant in this connection the court observes that the applicant provided additional information in his submissions before the court as to the types of proceedings he was referring to see paragraph above there are no indications or submissions from the applicant that he was prevented from making a substantiated submission before the domestic courts see saure cited above no it follows that the domestic authorities refusal to disclose certain parts of the information sought by the applicant in respect of the involvement of the judges concerned in proceedings concerning wrongful acts committed by the gdr did not breach article of the convention alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention about the lack of expedition and the length of the proceedings he further alleged that the domestic courts had not been impartial article in so far as relevant reads as follows in the determination of his civil rights and obligations everyone is entitled to a fair hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law the government submitted that the complaints were inadmissible in so far as he alleged a lack of impartiality on the part of the judges sitting on his case because it could not be ruled out that they had been directly concerned by his information request the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedies as required by article of the convention he had failed to challenge the judges of the potsdam administrative court sitting on his case in the proceedings before that court he had also not alleged a lack of impartiality in his subsequent submission to the administrative court of appeal or challenged the judges of that court in any event none of the judges who had sat on the applicants case could have been concerned by his information request the professional judges who had sat on the case at the administrative court had all been appointed after the reunification of germany they were not originally from the territory of the former gdr and there were no indications that they had collaborated with the ministry of state security none of the judges who had sat on the case at the administrative court of appeal had been serving at first instance on december the applicants allegation that the courts in brandenburg had lacked impartiality in general was an actio popularis and thus incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the convention the government added that the applicant had not complained about the allegedly excessive length or delays before the domestic courts and had not made use of the relevant domestic remedy section of the court constitutions act in any event the proceedings had not been excessively long the applicant submitted that it could not in theory be excluded that one of the judges concerned by his information request had sat on his case either in the proceedings concerning interim measures which had had a decisive impact on the outcome of the main proceedings or in the main proceedings before the potsdam administrative court as he did not know the names of the thirteen judges concerned or where they served he had been unable to lodge a bias complaint more generally citizens who brought proceedings concerning restitution and rehabilitation and had their claims assessed by judges who had themselves collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security did not have fair hearings before impartial tribunals and were unable to challenge the judges concerned as biased given that they did not know their names moreover the applicant submitted that the length of the proceedings had been excessive and had gradually diminished the value of the requested information he had not been required to make use of section of the court constitutions act as that remedy in his submission exclusively concerned compensation not the expedition of pending proceedings as regards the applicants complaint about the length of the proceedings the court considers that even assuming that article of the convention is applicable to the proceedings at issue he has failed to exhaust domestic remedies as required by article of the convention see saure cited above he did not make use of the remedy provided for by domestic law in that regard section of the court constitutions act see paragraph above to complain about the length of the proceedings nor did he raise a complaint of undue delay before the federal administrative court the purpose of which would have been to warn that court and enable it to expedite the proceedings see paragraph above similarly the applicant failed to exhaust domestic remedies as required by article of the convention in so far as he alleged a lack of impartiality on the part of the judges sitting on his case he did not lodge a bias complaint against the judges of the potsdam administrative court who sat on his case which he could have done on the grounds that it was known that four of the judges concerned by his information request were serving at specialised courts of first instance including in the administrative courts see paragraph above no knowledge of the names of the judges would have been required he also did not allege a lack of impartiality in his subsequent submission to the administrative court of appeal or challenge the judges of that court in this respect the court also takes note of the governments submission that none of the judges who had sat on the applicants case at the administrative court and at the administrative court of appeal could have been concerned by his information request see paragraph above it follows that the applicants complaints under article of the convention must be rejected in accordance with article and application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court finds that there has been a violation of the convention or the protocols thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party damage the applicant did not submit a claim in respect of pecuniary or nonpecuniary damage the court therefore makes no award costs and expenses the applicant claimed a total of euros eur in respect of costs and expenses comprising eur in court fees and eur in lawyers fees the applicant claimed a further eur for costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the court comprising eur in lawyers fees and eur for the translation into english of his written observations the applicant submitted invoices in respect of each item claimed the government submitted that the claim for costs and expenses was unjustified the reimbursement of lawyers fees was ruled out if such fees were borne not by the applicant himself but on his behalf by a third party there was evidence to suggest that the applicants employer or its holding company had borne the costs of the proceedings without subsequently charging them to the applicant the invoices submitted to the court were not addressed to the applicant but to axel springer se or kh who worked for the applicants employer as inhouse counsel it had to be assumed that the applicant had pursued the proceedings before the domestic courts and before this court on behalf of his employer for the purposes of reporting the latter and that all of the costs incurred had been borne by his employer the applicant had not provided any documentation to show that he himself had borne the lawyers fees and the court costs for which he was seeking reimbursement the government thus disputed that the applicant had incurred any costs at all in the alternative they submitted that the costs and expenses claimed were excessive as to quantum adding that the applicants statements in respect of the lawyers fees were incomplete or even false according to the courts caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these were actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum a representatives fees are actually incurred if the applicant has paid them or is liable to pay them see merabishvili v georgia gc no november in the present case regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria the court considers that the applicant has not provided any evidence that he paid or is liable to pay the costs and expenses claimed noting in particular that all the invoices submitted to the court were addressed to the applicants employer the court therefore considers that the applicant has not actually incurred the costs and expenses claimed and rejects his claim for these reasons the court unanimouslydeclares the complaint concerning article of the convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible holds that there has been a violation of article of the convention on account of the decision to refuse disclosure of additional information on the incriminating findings available against the thirteen judges and the public prosecutor holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention on account of the refusal to disclose the names and places of service of the thirteen judges and the public prosecutor as well as on account of the refusal to disclose the involvement of the judges concerned in certain types of proceedings dismisses the applicants claim for

56,in may the applicants wrote a letter to the international supervisor for bd to the president of the assembly of bd and to the governor of bd concerning the appointment of a director of the bd public radio station they referred in particular to msʼs candidacy for that position ms was the entertainment editor at the bd public radio at the material time the relevant part of the letter reads as follows we acknowledge and appreciate your support and the effort you put in creating a multiethnic radio unfortunately it appears that there was a major oversight at the very beginning of this important venture the panel for the selection of the director of the radio was created in contravention of the statute of brčko district it is composed of three serb members one croat and one bosniac thus yet again the statute which requires proportional representation of the three constituent peoples in public institutions was disregarded unfortunately nothing has been done to correct this the unofficial information we received to the effect that ms ms was proposed for the position of the radio director by the serb members of the panel although the former director was bosniac confirms the above this proposal is unacceptable all the more so because it concerns a person who lacks the professional and moral qualities for such a position according to the information we receivedin an interview published in nin discussing the destruction of mosques in brčko ms ms said that muslims were not people that they did not possess culture and that accordingly destroying mosques could not be seen as a destruction of cultural monuments on the radios premises she made a point of removing from the wall and tore to pieces the calendar with the schedule of religious services during the month of ramadanon the radios premises she covered the coat of arms of bosnia and herzegovina with the coat of arms of the republika srpskaas the editor of the entertainment programme she banned broadcasting of sevdalinka arguing that that type of song had no cultural or musical value we firmly believe that the abovedescribed acts absolutely disqualify ms ms as a candidate for the position of the director of the multiethnic radio and television of brčko district we hope that you will act accordingly in the absence of any action on your part we will be forced to contact the media as well as the other competent national and international bodies shortly thereafter the letter was published in three different daily newspapers on may ms initiated civil defamation proceedings against the applicants and claimed compensation of convertible marks bam ms submitted that she had learned about the content of the letter shorlty after it had been sent by the defendants but that she did not know who gave it to the media after the letter was published the governor of bd annulled the proceedings for the appointment of a director of the public radio station on september the bd court of first instance the court of first instance rejected the claim it held that the applicants could not be liable for the alleged defamation because they had not published the letter in the media the relevant part of the judgment reads as follows from the defendants letter it is clear that it was privately sent to the governor to the president of the assembly and to the supervisor for brčko districtand it was not sent to the media the aim of the letter was not dissemination of unverified information to public but bringing the attention of the competent authorities to certain issues and to enable them to draw certain conclusions on verification of that information having examined the articles published in the media the court concludes that none of them was published by the defendants in this case ms appealed against that judgment to the bd appellate court the appellate court on may the appellate court quashed the judgment of september and decided to hold a new hearing on july after having examined several witnesses including the two employees of the bd public radio from whom the applicants received the information presented in their letter the appellate court found that the contested letter contained some valuejudgments but also the statements of facts which had been untrue and damaging to msʼs reputation it held that for the liability for defamation to be established under section of the defamation act it was irrelevant that the applicants did not publish the letter the appellate court ordered the applicants to inform the international supervisor for bd the president of the assembly of bd and the bds governor about the retraction of their statements within days in default of which they had to pay bam in damage to ms together with default interest at the statutory rate from july they were further ordered to publish the judgment at their own expense on november ms filed a request for the enforcement of the above judgment to the court of first instance she proposed inter alia that the court send the judgment of july for publication at the applicants expense on december the court of first instance issued a writ of execution on december the applicants paid bam approximately euros eur by way of the enforcement of the judgment of july on march the court of first instance closed the enforcement proceedings in the meantime on october the applicants complained about the violation of their right to freedom of expression to the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina the constitutional court on may the constitutional court held that the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression was necessary in a democratic society and concluded that there had been no violation of article iih of the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina and article of the convention the relevant part of the decision reads as follows at the outset the constitutional court notes that the appellants did not deny that their liability for defamation was based on the defamation act and that therefore the interference with the right to freedom of expression protected by article of the european convention was prescribed by law the impugned judgment was delievered in a civil defamation proceedings initiated by the plaintiff against the appellantsaccordingly the interference pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation or rights of others what remains to be determined is whether the interference complained of was necessary in a democratic society the constitutional court considers that the appellate court established without doubt that the impugned factual statements about ms were false and that the appellants were liable for defamation from the submissions of the two witnesses from whom the appellants received the information presented in the letter concerning the part of the letter in which it was stated that ms made a point of removing from the wall and tore to pieces the calendar with the schedule of religious services during the month of ramadan and as the editor of the entertainment programme she banned broadcasting of sevdalinka arguing that that type of song had no cultural or musical value the appellate court established that there was an evident inconsistency between that what had been said to the appellants and that what they had reported in the letter furthermore the statement from the impugned letter that ms gave an interview concerning the destruction of mosques was refuted by another witness who submitted that a subsequent verification had revealed that ms had not been the author of the said interview finally the appellants failed to prove the veracity of the allegations that ms covered the coat of arms of bosnia and herzegovina with the coat of arms of the republika srpska in view of the above the constitutional court considers that in the present case the right of the appellants to report irregularities in the conduct of an official to a body competent to deal with such complaints can not be premised on ascertaining manifestly untrue facts which go beyond the limit of acceptable criticism of civil servants accordingly the court considers that the appellate court correctly concluded that there was a pressing social need in the present case for the interference with the appellants right to freedom of expression furthermore the constitutional court notes that the appellate court awarded nonpecuniary damage to ms because her reputation was affected by the untrue statements made in the impugned letter the constitutional court has already stated in its previous jurisprudence that a persons reputation forms part of her personal identity and psychological integrity the appellantsfailed to verify the impugned statements beforehand as was their duty the appeal court established that the appellants had damaged mss reputation by making untrue allegations which caused her mental anguish when deciding on the claim in respect of nonpecuniary damage and its amount the appellate court took into account the purpose of those damages as well as that it should not favour aspirations that are incompatible with its nature and social purpose the constitutional court considers that a measure imposed on the appellants in the present case was proportionate to the aim pursued the court further considers that the appellate court did not go beyond its discretionary power in deciding on the claim in respect of nonpecuniary damage the constitutional court finds that the reasons the appellate court gave were relevant and sufficient within the meaning of article of the european convention in view of the above the constitutional court considers that the interference with the appellants right to freedom of expression was necessary in a democratic society and that therefore there has been no violation of article iih of the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina and article of the european convention on september the constitutional courts decision was served on the applicants ii relevant domestic lawa constitution of bosnia and herzegovina the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina annex to the general framework

or negligently disregarded its inaccuracy the same standard of responsibility referred to above applies in a situation when defamatory statement was made in relation to a public servantor a candidate

and even in the absence of pecuniary damage when deciding on a claim for nonpecuniary damages and its amount the court shall take into account the purpose of those damages as well as that it should not favour aspirations that are incompatible with its nature and social purpose the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicants complained under article of the convention that the domestic courts decisions had entailed interference with their right to freedom of expression that could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society article reads everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissionsa the applicants the applicants maintained that their intention had been to inform those in authority about certain irregularities in a matter of considerable public interest and to prompt them to investigate the allegations made in the letter the letter had been sent privately and its subsequent publication had occurred without their knowledge moreover the letter contained their value judgments concerning mss suitability for the position of a director of the bd public radio station the subject matter of the letter was of a public interest nature since it concerned the suitability of a candidate for the post of a director of a multiethnic public radio station as well as the selection processb the government the government agreed that there had been an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression but submitted that it had been prescribed by law had pursued a legitimate aim and had been necessary in a democratic society the applicants liability for defamation had been established by the appellate court which had found that their letter contained both opinions value judgments as well as the untrue and damaging factual statements about ms who was a public servant at the material time the applicants had failed to verify these facts before presenting them in the letter the constitutional court upheld those findings moreover considering that the letter was later published through an unknown source its content was made available to the general public and the consequences for mss reputation had become even more serious thus it could not be argued that this case was only about private correspondence between the applicants and the competent authorities the government further maintained that it could not be excluded that the applicants had themselves sent the letter to the media lastly in view of the measure imposed on the applicants for defamation the government concluded that a fair balance was struck between the applicants right to freedom of expression and mss rights under article of the convention the courts assessment it is common ground between the parties and the court agrees that the decisions of the domestic courts and the award of damages made against the applicants amounted to interference by a public authority with the applicants right to freedom of expression under the first paragraph of article of the convention it is also undisputed that the interference was prescribed by law namely section of the defamation act and pursued a legitimate aim that of the protection of mss reputation it follows that the main question to be addressed in the present case is whether the impugned measure was necessary in a democratic society the test of whether the interference complained of was necessary in a democratic society requires the court to determine whether it corresponded to a pressing social need whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation this power of appreciation is not however unlimited but goes hand in hand with european supervision by the court whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article for an analysis of the relevant principles in more detail see among many other authorities mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no echr extracts the court observes that in the present case the defamation claim was born out of the applicants private correspondence with the local authorities see kazakov v russia no december sofranschi v moldova no december and siryk v ukraine no march in the impugned letter the applicants stated their complaints about ms who was the editor of the entertainment programme at the bd public radio at the material time and one of the candidates for the post of director of that radio station as well as about the selection process they claimed that their intention was to inform competent authority about certain irregularities in a matter of important public interest and to prompt them to investigate the allegations in the letter while it is true that the impugned statements were subsequently made public the court notes that there was no evidence in the domestic proceedings that the applicants had participated in their publication that was indeed the point of view of the firstinstance court see paragraph above moreover the appellate court only found the applicants liable for defamation by sending the impugned letter to the authorities competent for taking relevant further steps into the matter and this was upheld by the constitutional court the court will therefore refrain from taking into consideration any other alleged means of defamation of ms by the applicants see mutatis mutandis sofranschi cited above the court has in several cases observed that it may be necessary to protect public servants from offensive abusive and defamatory attacks which are calculated to affect them in the performance of their duties and to damage public confidence in them and the office they hold see janowski v poland gc no echr i and lešník v slovakia no echr iv the extent to which such protection might be deemed necessary depends on the particular circumstances of the case in the present case the court is ready to accept that a candidate for a position of a director of a public radio may be considered to belong to that category of official the government maintained the same see paragraph above however the court reiterates that as the applicants set out their grievances in correspondence submitted in their private capacity the requirements of protection under article of the convention have to be weighed not in relation to the interests of the freedom of the press or of open discussion of matters of public concern but rather against the applicants right to report irregularities in the conduct of an official to a body competent to deal with such complaints see zakharov v russia no october kazakov cited above and siryk cited above that citizens should be able to notify competent state officials about the conduct of civil servants which to them appears irregular or unlawful is one of the precepts of the rule of law see zakharov cited above turning to the present case the court notes that the applicants letter sent to the highest authorities of bd contained factual allegations about mss alleged misconduct as well as some value judgments in its practice the court has distinguished between statements of fact and value judgments the existence of facts can be demonstrated whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article see jerusalem v austria no echr ii however even where a statement amounts to a value judgment the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive see de haes and gijsels v belgium no february the court observes that in the present case the domestic courts made a distinction between statements of facts and value judgments contrast with sofranschi cited above the appellate court had premised its finding of the applicants liability on inaccuracy of factual statements made in their letter after having heard the witnesses see paragraph above there is nothing in the casefile to indicate that the applicants did not have an effective opportunity to adduce evidence in support of their allegations and to thereby establish their truthfulness unlike the position in busuioc v moldova no december savitchi v moldova no october and sofranschi cited above the court notes that the applicants did not resort in their letter to abusive strong or intemperate language moreover it does not consider that their complaint was vexatious or that it constituted a gratuitous personal attack on ms however as the domestic courts correctly concluded the applicants had acted negligently in reporting mss alleged misconduct it appears that they had simply passed on the information they received without making a reasonable effort to verify its accuracy in addition when the applicants were ordered by the appellate court to inform the international supervisor for bd the president of the assembly of bd and the bds governor about the retraction of their statements they failed to do so see paragraph above in the overall circumstances of the instant case the court finds that the solution of the domestic courts struck a fair balance between the competing interests of the claimant and those of the applicants and the reasons given to justify their decisions were relevant and sufficient and met a pressing social need the court also had regard to the award of damages made against the applicants in the context of a civil action and did not find it to be disproportionate therefore the court does not see any serious reason to substitute its own assessment for that of the constitutional court which examined the question at issue with care and in line with the principles laid down by the courts caselaw accordingly there has been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court declares unanimously the application admissible holds by four votes to three that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on october pursuant to rule and of the rules of court françoise elens passos guido raimondi registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the joint separate opinion of judges nicolaou tsotsoria and vehabović is annexed to this judgment grafep joint dissenting opinion of judges nicolaou tsotsoria and vehabović we regret that we are unable to subscribe to the view of the majority that the appellate court judgment finding the applicants liable for defamation as upheld by the constitutional court was compatible with article of the convention we are of the opinion that it was not and that there has therefore been a violation of the applicants right to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas under that article section of the defamation act of bd defines defamation as causing damage to the reputation of a person by ascertaining or disseminating a falsehood in relation to that person it is of course for the domestic courts to interpret legislation but no question arises as to the meaning and effect of the relevant provision in the present case what is at issue is in effect whether the undisputed facts of the case could conceivably afford grounds for imputing any liability to the applicants as we understand those facts they clearly do not we note first that it can not be said that the applicants were in the circumstances responsible for disseminating the letter complained of they addressed it to the competent authorities that is to say the international supervisor for bd the president of the assembly of bd and the governor of bd it was a very limited communication which was both private and confidential and was made to persons who had a direct institutional interest in the matter and were thus entitled to receive it the letter was certainly not meant for wider publication or in the words of section of the defamation act for dissemination that the applicants reserved the right to contact the media if no action was taken by the authorities does not detract from this argument whether such an eventuality would have materialised and if so in what form or with what content one simply does not know lastly it has not been suggested that the applicants should be held accountable for the ultimate dissemination of the letter in which they were not shown to have been involved in any way the letter in question concerned in essence the procedure for the appointment of a director of the bd public radio it contained views on matters of public interest it criticised the approach already taken by the authorities and transmitted to them unofficial information received in relation to candidate ms to the effect that ms was unsuitable for the post the gist of it all was that the authorities were dutybound to direct their attention to the said unofficial information and if it was substantiated to act accordingly it was clear that the applicants relied on the authorities to inquire into the various allegations and to evaluate them the fact that some of the allegations to which that information referred might have been shown after inquiry to be unfounded or inaccurate could not by itself vitiate the propriety of the applicants communication with the authorities what is germane to the present purpose is that the applicants themselves made no definite or final assertions as to the facts in the words of section of the defamation act there was nothing they did that could fairly be regarded as tantamount to ascertaining a falsehood we would further emphasise that in this type of situation the communication should be seen in context account should be taken of the need to protect the reputation of the individual but also of the need to maintain confidence in public administration by encouraging the involvement of citizens and addressing their concerns people are entitled in the discharge of their civic duties to bring relevant information to the attention of the authorities and may indeed do so in strong terms in an attempt to persuade the authorities to scrutinise such information so as to ensure sound administration in public affairs a person may sometimes overstep the mark and where that happens a proportionality exercise may be necessary in the present case the highest domestic courts approached the case as if the applicants had actually gone farther than they should have done even if that were the case the courts then failed in our view to carry out a meaningful examination of the relevant competing interests bearing on the proportionality of state interference with the right to freedom of expression under article the convertible mark uses the same fixed exchange rate to the euro that the german mark has eur bam,,,
57,its seat in vienna and was represented by zöchbauer frauenberger rechtsanwälte a law firm practising in vienna the government were represented by their agent mr h tichy ambassador head of the international law department at the federal ministry for european and international affairs the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows the applicant company is the media owner of the daily newspaper österreich on july österreich reported on a meeting that took place in july between nh then a candidate for the office of federal president of austria and the german daily newspaper bild the article stated that during that meeting nh had been confronted with a photograph from showing nhs office manager büroleiter rs together with the latters brother hs and gk at an event identified as being part of the rightwing scene see paragraph below statements made by nh in reaction to the political past of his office manager were reported the article in question appeared at a delicate point during the presidential elections in austria on july the constitutional court had declared unconstitutional a runoff ballot between nh the candidate of the freedom party of austria freiheitliche partei österreich or fpö and avd b an independent candidate supported by the greens die grünen because of inconsistencies in the counting of the votes see constitutional court judgment no wi of july the difference in ballots cast for the two candidates amounted to only around votes a second repeated runoff ballot was planned for october public interest in the two candidates and the election process was immense at the time the report printed in österreich which was illustrated by inter alia the abovementioned photograph read as follows interview with bild fuss about nh in germany fp freedom party candidates office manager appears in a photo with neo nazi gknewspaper bild caused an unpleasant situation for fpö candidate nhberlin nh the candidate for federal president designated by the freedom party had intended to launch a charm offensive by means of giving several international interviews the german newspaper bild thwarted his plans though nhs staff member was present at the interview because after the talk the bild journalists showed a photograph to nh depicting convicted neo nazis gk and hs and the latters brother rs hs and rs carry batons schlagstöcke gk gives the radical rightwing kühnen salute the nazi salute with extended thumb index and middle finger the matter is piquant pikant because today rs works as the office manager of nh in this capacity he was also present at the bild interview but initially the editors did not notice that at all rs was under and does not have a criminal record nh defends himself yes this is rs i know the photo my staff member never did anything wrong he has never been indicted or convicted one should not rs how long ago did that take place years ago use something like that against someone bild quoted h as saying specifically the photograph is of a meeting in rs was not yet eighteen years old he does not have a criminal record was never convicted or reported to the police says a spokesperson of nh rather rs was perceived as a follower mitläufer of the rightwing scene of that time nh stands by his staff member he does not only retain him as his office manager if he is elected federal president he also wants to take rs with him to the hofburg the official residence and workplace of the federal president of austria on july hs brought proceedings under section of the copyright act see paragraph below requesting that the applicant company be prohibited from publishing pictures of him without his consent in the event that any accompanying text stated that he was a convicted neo nazi andor made statements of equivalent meaning in addition he lodged an application for the issuance of an interim injunction einstweilige verfügung to that effect arguing that his conviction of twenty years earlier had long been expunged he referred to section of the criminal record deletion act tilgungsgesetz see paragraph below according to which all negative consequences that were connected to that conviction ceased to exist he did not dispute that he had been convicted in under the national socialist prohibition act verbotsgesetz the prohibition act but he had been released on parole in he argued that he had reintegrated in society had founded a family and had taken a regular job he stated that by spending several years in prison he had paid for his actions which he had committed during a longclosed phase of his life he had behaved well ever since was no longer a public figure and was certainly not a person of interest within the context of the report he did not even know nh overall he did not have to accept the statement that he was a convicted neo nazi in its submissions in reply klagebeantwortung the applicant company argued that the criminal proceedings against hs had been subject to countless reports by domestic as well as international media in the s the impugned statement that he was a convicted neo nazi was undisputedly true it furthermore submitted that the plaintiff was one of the most important former austrian neo nazis and that the circumstances that had led to his conviction were of historical importance zeitgeschichtlich bedeutend thus the plaintiff was an absolute person of contemporary history absolute person der zeitgeschichte furthermore he had not ceased his respective political activities after his release from prison but was still active in the neo nazi scene by way of proving that statement the applicant company quoted a wikipedia entry about hs as well as an article by the documentation archive of the austrian resistance dokumentationsarchiv des oesterreichischen widerstandes according to which the plaintiff hs had attended two public events with gk in namely an event in carinthia organised by the freedom party of austria and an event in leipzig organized by die freien kräfte leipzig where both hs and gk had allegedly given speeches on the prohibition act there was a public interest in knowing about the political circles in which nh a presidential candidate moved and the impugned report had broached the issue of how the freedom party of austria dealt with rightwing extremism it was therefore covered by article of the convention hs disputed the allegation that he had engaged in any activities in the neo nazi scene after his conviction he argued that the event in carinthia in had served the purpose of commemorating war veterans and had been attended by several members of different political parties as regards the event in leipzig in the same year he denied that he had made the comments that had been mentioned in the articles quoted by the applicant company he had only expressed his personal experiences at an event organised by the national democratic party of germany nationaldemokratische partei deutschland or npd a recognised political party by a decision of august the vienna commercial court handelsgericht wien in provisional proceedings provisorialverfahren dismissed hss application for the issuance of an interim injunction the court essentially argued that the public interest in receiving information on nhs circles including his staff members and the interest of the applicant company in publication outweighed the interest of hs in the observance of confidentiality moreover the assertion made in the article in respect of hs namely that he was a convicted neo nazi was true by a decision of september the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht wien dismissed an appeal lodged by hs essentially endorsing the reasoning of the lower court however following a further appeal by hs the supreme court oberster gerichtshof in a decision of january case no ob g prohibited the applicant company from publishing pictures of hs without his consent if at the same time he is called a convicted neo nazi in the accompanying report andor statements of equivalent meaning are made about him there and gave the following reasoning the supreme court has already approved in case no ob s see paragraph below in respect of another company which is also a part of the defendants media company the prohibition of the publication of the plaintiffs hss image without his consent if the accompanying text describes him as a neo nazi leader and does not state at the same time that he has already served his prison sentence and has behaved well since in the case at hand the defendant published an article in its periodical publication österreich on july in which the claimant hs is referred to as a convicted neo nazi a photograph accompanying this article shows the claimant next to the convicted gk among other persons this court can not uphold the lowerinstance judgments holding that decision no ob s had been complied with despite the fact that the plaintiff was described in the article as a convicted neo nazi but at the same time in the accompanying text it was stated that the neo nazi meeting depicted in the picture had taken place in the supreme court has clarified that any balancing of interests performed when assessing the legality of photojournalistic coverage concerning a convicted person after his or her release on parole must consider among other things the connection between the contents of the report in question and the accompanying picture as well as the completeness and correctness of the accompanying text decision no ob t the contents of the article impugned in this case however are not concerned with the claimant but with his brother and with a candidate for the election of the federal president therefore there was no objective justification at all for the reference to the previous conviction of the claimant as a neo nazi subsequently in the main proceedings the vienna commercial court by judgment of april ordered the applicant company to refrain from now on from publishing pictures of hs without his consent if at the same time he is called a convicted neo nazi in the accompanying report andor statements of equivalent meaning are made about him therein at the same time it dismissed the claim lodged by hs for euros eur plus interest and costs by way of compensation for nonpecuniary damage and ordered the applicant company to reimburse hs for the costs of the proceedings in its reasoning the court essentially noted referring to the reasoning of the supreme court in the provisional proceedings see paragraph above that a balancing of the clearly infringed interests of the claimant against the public interest in the publication that gave rise to the instant proceedings apparently does not have to be carried out the claim lodged by hs for compensation for nonpecuniary damage had to be dismissed given the fact that a particular injury that is to say an injury exceeding the usual measure über das übliche maß hinausgehende kränkung could not have occurred for the very reason that the facts in question are indisputably true the vienna court of appeal did not grant the related appeal lodged by the applicant company dismissing it by a judgment of september it essentially stated that according to the legal view held by the supreme court there had been no objective justification for the reference to the conviction of the claimant as a neo nazi in the impugned article because the contents of the article had not concerned the claimant but his brother and a candidate in the election for the federal president therefore it was unnecessary to balance the individual interests of the claimant against the public interest in being informed about the political environment in which the office manager of the presidential candidate moved it ordered the applicant company to reimburse hs for the costs of the proceedings by a decision of december case no ob s the supreme court rejected an extraordinary appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant company it referred to its reasoning in the provisional proceedings see paragraph above and added citing the case of österreichischer rundfunk v austria no december that there was no temporal connection between the photograph taken in hss criminal conviction in and the applicant company calling him a convicted neo nazi in the impugned article of relevant domestic legal framework and practice section of the copyright act urheberrechtsgesetz prohibits any public exhibition andor dissemination of images where the legitimate interests of the person in question would be violated it reads as follows in its relevant parts protection of ones image section images of persons shall neither be exhibited publicly nor disseminated in any other manner by which they are made accessible to the public where the legitimate interests of the person in question or in the event that they have died without having authorised or ordered publication of a close relative would be injured in assessing whether legitimate interests are violated not only the picture alone has to be considered but also the accompanying text in its overall context see supreme court cases no ob t and no ob w in its decision of october case no ob s see paragraph above regarding a different article published by the applicant company that had contained a photograph of hs with the accompanying caption neo nazi leader the supreme court held that the picture as such was connected with events of contemporary historical significance however the publication of photographs that together with the accompanying text recalled crimes committed long ago by the person depicted would generally disproportionately impair his or her advancement owing to the pillorying effect prangerwirkung that would arise therefrom according to the supreme court this applied all the more if the person concerned in the instant case hs in had already served his or her prison sentence and had been socially reintegrated for years and for those reasons had a legitimate interest in the public not being reminded of his or her past the supreme court found that the lower courts had taken into account the public interest in the publication of the photograph as they had not generally prohibited it a legitimate interest in such publication could not however justify creating the incorrect impression that hs who had been fully rehabilitated and was not any longer in the public eye was still active as a neo nazi leader starting with its judgment of september case no ob the supreme court has consistently held that section of the copyright act has to be interpreted in the light of section a of the media act mediengesetz this provision specifies in which cases the publication of images of victims suspects or offenders is to be permitted by giving details of the criteria for the balancing of interests to be performed accordingly the austrian courts have to assess by way of a first step whether there is a public interest in publication and which legitimate interests of the person concerned run counter to publication subsequently the legitimate interests of the person concerned must be balanced against the public interest if any in the publication of that persons image publication is permitted only if the public interest in publication is the overriding interest such overriding public interest in publication may exist for instance on account of the persons position in society or of some other connection of that person with public life section a of the media act provides that the legitimate interests of the person concerned will in any event be harmed if the publication of an article or photograph may disproportionately prejudice the advancement of the person concerned sections to of the criminal record deletion act tilgungsgesetz read as follows in their relevant parts expunging of criminal convictions section save for cases where it is excluded judicial convictions will be expunged getilgt ex lege at the expiry of the applicable period with the expunging of a conviction all negative consequences that are connected by law to that conviction cease to exist unless they consist of the loss of special rights on the basis of election award or appointment if a conviction has been expunged from the criminal record the convicted person will henceforth be deemed to be judicially innocent unbescholten unless this is countered by another as yet unexpunged conviction heshe is not obliged to mention the expunged conviction an expunged conviction may neither be noted in criminalrecord information strafregisterauskunft or in criminalrecord certificates strafregisterbescheinigung or be made evident in them in any way start of the period of expungement tilgungsfrist section the period of expungement shall start as soon as all prison sentences or financial penalties freiheits oder geldstrafen have been executed are deemed to have been executed have been suspended nachgesehen or may no longer be executed period of expungement in the case of a single conviction section if someone has been convicted only once the period of expungement is fifteen years if he or she has been sentenced to more than three years imprisonment article of the criminal code strafgesetzbuch reads as follows any person who accuses another of an offence for which that person has already served his or her sentence for which the sentence has been conditionally or unconditionally suspended or waived or in respect of which sentencing has been temporarily adjourned in such a way that the target of the accusation is identifiable by a third person is liable to imprisonment for up to three months or a fine not exceeding one hundred and eighty dayfines the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant company complained that the domestic courts decisions had violated its right to freedom of expression as provided in article of the convention which in so far as relevant reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the court notes that the application is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merits the parties submissionsa the applicant company the applicant company submitted that the public interest in being informed of the nature of the political milieu of the office manager of the presidential candidate nh prevailed in the instant case that milieu included the most prominent austrian former neo nazis gk and his former deputy hs the fact that the office manager of the presidential candidate had attended a public protest wielding a baton alongside those two subsequently convicted neo nazis bore witness to the political environment that surrounded nh himself the applicant company argued that this spoke volumes as to the way in which the freedom party of austria and nh who had at the time also been the third president of the austrian national assembly nationalrat dealt with rightwing extremism such information was very valuable and could only be proved by publishing the photograph of and referring to hss conviction turning to the criteria established in the courts caselaw regarding the balancing of respective rights under article and article of the convention see von hannover no v germany gc nos and echr the applicant company argued that the publication of the impugned article and photograph had reported on the criminal conviction of hs in a purely factual manner furthermore it had reported truthfully on the fact that the german newspaper bild had confronted the presidential candidate nh with the photo showing rs with hs and gk next the applicant company submitted that the statement that hs was a convicted neo nazi had been true referring to the case of österreichischer rundfunk v austria no december see also paragraph below the applicant company stated that the criminal proceedings against him and his conviction for acts punishable under the prohibition act on account of his activities as a leading member of the extra parliamentary organisation opposition true to the people volkstreue außerparlamentarische opposition vapo formed an important part of contemporary judicial history the applicant company did not make any submissions regarding hss conduct after his conviction in nor did it dispute the governments submission that he had not been convicted since see paragraphs below as to the consequences of the article in question the applicant company argued that it had had no repercussions for hs he had not asserted during the domestic proceedings that there had been such repercussions and neither had any been identified by the national courts the applicant company argued that accusing someone of an expunged criminal act under article of the criminal code see paragraph above did not form a basis for the claims under section of the copyright act in the sense of sections et seq of the media act in addition the court had already stated in the case of schwabe v austria august series a no b that a reference to previous criminal convictions was covered by article of the convention in respect of politically significant matters the applicant company did not make any submissions regarding the severity of sanctions imposed on it by the domestic courtsb the government the government conceded that the injunction against the applicant company had constituted an interference with its right to freedom of expression this interference had been based on the law and had pursued a legitimate aim namely the protection of the rights of others in particular hs they considered that the remaining question was whether the measure had also been necessary in a democratic society the article published by the applicant company had been about nh being confronted by the newspaper bild with the political background of his office manager and not with the political background of hs the office managers brother and the plaintiff in the domestic proceedings giving rise to the present application hs had featured in the report only in so far as he had also been depicted in the photograph dating from that had been printed likewise the subject of the article published in the german newspaper bild had been the political background of the office manager of nh and nhs position in that regard this had clearly been indicated by the title of the article what is your staff member doing there mr nh however unlike in the article of the applicant company hs had neither been mentioned by name nor referred to as a convicted neo nazi in the article of the german newspaper bild in the present case the picture in question had been neither published in the course of reporting on a crime or of any other reporting concerning hs the contents of the applicant companys article had consisted of the position taken by a presidential candidate nh in respect of his office manager rs who some people considered to have a certain proximity to the rightwing scene thus the subject of the article had been of general public interest and had formed part of a political debate in so far the austrian courts only had a limited margin of appreciation to interfere with the applicant companys rights that were protected under article of the convention hs had been convicted under the prohibition act by a final judgment in and had served a prison sentence until he had not thereafter been convicted of any other crime as ruled by the supreme court in its decision of january see paragraph above the reference to the fact that the brother of the office manager of a presidential candidate had been convicted more than twenty years earlier had had no objective connection to the report on the political background of that office manager there had thus been no objective justification for the reference because that reference had added nothing to a political debate or to a debate regarding the public interest unlike the reporting on the political orientation of that presidential candidates office manager andor on the presidential candidates position in respect of his office manager the interest of hs was quite obvious the publication of pictures that together with the accompanying text recalled offences committed long before would disproportionately prejudice his advancement as he had already served his sentence had been socially integrated for years and had thus had a legitimate interest in ensuring that the public was not reminded of offences that he had once committed that applied all the more given the fact that the reference in question had been made entirely without any information to the effect that the corresponding conviction by a criminal court had taken place more than twenty years before the sentence had long since been served and expunged from his criminal record and he had not been convicted for any crimes since any other interpretation would run contrary to the meaning and purpose of expunging a conviction from a persons criminal record with few exceptions all negative consequences arising by virtue of law from a conviction were erased upon expunged thereafter the person concerned was deemed to have no record and was not obligated to disclose such an expunged conviction see section of the criminal record deletion act quoted in paragraph above the legal system of austria attached great importance to the reintegration of convicted offenders into society and to their interest in a reformed positive advancement after serving their sentences accusing someone of prior offences that had been served or waived was an offence in itself see section of the criminal code quoted in paragraph above the public had already been informed in great detail about the criminal proceedings conducted against hs his conviction in and his release in all those events had been the subject of extensive photojournalistic coverage without doubt the crime committed by hs had been grave and of a political nature more than two decades later however it could be assumed that in the absence of any specific occasion and context no public interest in information any longer existed to justify publishing a picture with the accompanying text convicted neo nazi moreover it had to be assumed that the notoriety that hs had definitely had at the time of his conviction had decreased quite considerably over more than two decades during which he had not committed any other offences that conclusion could not be altered by the argument that the applicant companys article had been intended to portray the milieu in which rs the office manager of the presidential candidate had moved in his past the public interest in such information could have been satisfied sufficiently by for instance simply printing the picture dating from together with an explanation to the effect that it showed rs at a neo nazi meeting the fact that all the people shown in the picture wearing leather jackets and carrying batons andor giving the kühnen salute were attributable to the neo nazi scene must in any case have been obvious to any reader of the article this was where the case at hand differed significantly from the facts on which the courts judgment in the case of österreichischer rundfunk cited above had been based at that time it had been the temporal proximity between the release from prison of the applicant in that case and the report that had been relevant for the courts decision against this backdrop the criterion of the completeness and correctness of the text accompanying the photograph developed by the court in its caselaw was gaining significance however this was precisely the requirement that the newspaper article of the applicant company had not met there had been no information in the newspaper article to the effect that hs had served his sentence long before and had behaved well ever since in both of its decisions adopted in the case giving rise to this application see paragraphs and above the austrian supreme court referring to the courts relevant caselaw and making reference to its decision in case no ob s where it had for the purpose of presenting the full facts demanded such additional information from the newspaper publisher in a very similar case had specifically pointed out that in the article in question the applicant company had not had regard to that requirement in the governments view the interference had also been proportionate the austrian courts had prohibited the applicant company from publishing images of hs only if the text in question at the same time referred to him as a convicted neo nazi andor statements of equivalent meaning would have been made about him thus the domestic decisions had not constituted a general prohibition on any photojournalistic coverage whatsoever or a ban on publishing any pictures of hs and they had not provided a fine or prosecution under section of the criminal code see paragraph above equally the claim for damages lodged by hs against the applicant company had been dismissed see paragraphs above the government therefore considered that there had been no violation of article in the instant case the courts assessment the court observes that the present case concerns proceedings under the copyright act brought by hs against the applicant company in respect of a newspaper report in which his picture had been shown it did not address the reporting about him or the publication of the picture as such but only the publication of that picture together with certain accompanying statements see paragraph above the courts ordered the applicant company to refrain from now on from publishing pictures of hs without his consent if at the same time he is called a convicted neo nazi in the text in question andor statements of equivalent meaning are made about him there see paragraphs and above it is undisputed that the courts judgments in these proceedings constituted an interference with the applicant companys right to freedom of expression it is not in dispute either that the interference was prescribed by law and served a legitimate aim namely the protection of the rights and reputation of others in particular those of hs the court agrees with this assessment the parties arguments thus concentrated on the necessity of the interference the issue in the present case is whether the domestic courts ensured a fair balance between the protection of the applicant companys right to freedom of expression on the one hand and the right to respect for private life of the opposing party on the other handa general principles the general principles regarding freedom of expression are wellestablished in the courts caselaw see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no echr extracts and the cases cited therein although the press must not overstep certain bounds regarding in particular protection of reputation and rights of others its task is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities information and ideas on all matters of public interest not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas the public also has a right to receive them were it otherwise the press would be unable to play its vital role of public watchdog ibid in this regard the court reiterates that there is little scope under article of the convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate on matters of public interest see for example couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above and the cases cited therein as regards the freedom of expression within the context of reporting and publishing photographs the question of assessing the necessity of an interference with that freedom and the states margin of appreciation in that respect the court refers to its established caselaw in the cases of couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above and von hannover no cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc no february the court notes that applications such as the present one call for an examination of the fair balance to be struck between on the one hand the applicant companys right to freedom of expression and the publics freedom of information under article and on the other hand the respect for the private life and the right to protection of ones own image under article of the convention of the person concerned in examining this balance the court must have regard among other factors to the states positive obligations under article of the convention see x and y v the netherlands march series a no and von hannover no cited above and to the principles established in its settled caselaw regarding the essential role played by the press in a democratic society see news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i this includes reporting and commenting on court proceedings and more particularly criminal proceedings see ml and ww v germany nos and and june with regard to persons who have been convicted the court has found without explicitly distinguishing between the seriousness of the underlying criminal offences that after a certain period of time has elapsed and in particular as their release from prison approaches convicted persons have an interest in no longer being confronted with their acts with a view to their reintegration in society this may be especially true once a convicted person has been finally released likewise the public interest as regards criminal proceedings will vary in degree as it may evolve during the course of the proceedings according to a number of factors such as the circumstances of the case in question ibid referring to the cases of österreichischer rundfunk cited above and mutatis mutandis segerstedt wiberg and others v sweden no echr vii the court in its caselaw has identified a number of criteria within the context of balancing the competing rights under articles and of the convention see paragraph above in particular when the publication of photos was at stake the relevant criteria include the contribution to a debate of public interest the degree of notoriety of the person affected the subject of the news report the prior conduct of the person concerned the content form and consequences of publication and where appropriate the circumstances in which the photographs were taken see von hannover no cited above von hannover no no september and axel springer ag cited above where it examines an application lodged under article the court will also examine the way in which the information was obtained and its veracity and the gravity of the penalty imposed on the journalists or publishers see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés and axel springer ag both cited above the court considers in each case whether the criteria thus defined may be transposed to the case in question although certain criteria may have more or less relevance given the particular circumstances of the case see satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june where the balancing exercise between the competing rights has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see axel springer ag von hannover no both cited above and more recently delfi as v estonia gc no echr in the case of österreichischer rundfunk cited above which concerned proceedings under the copyright act brought by hs against a different media company the domestic courts had prohibited that media company from showing hss picture in connection with any report stating that he had been convicted under the prohibition act once the sentence had been executed or once he had been released on parole the court found a violation of article of the convention for the following reasons mr s who brought the proceedings at issue is a wellknown member of the neo nazi scene in austria the court has already held in a similar case that a person expressing extremist views lays himself open to public scrutiny see news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i moreover mr s was convicted of crimes under the prohibition act in and was sentenced to a lengthy prison term for being a leading member of vapo an organisation aimed at destroying the austrian constitutional order in the domestic courts assessment the proceedings against mr s were among the most important ones under the prohibition act at the time of his trial his picture was widely published turning to the nature and subject matter of the news item broadcast by the applicant the court notes that it was a brief report dealing mainly with the release on parole of mr k the leader of vapo and the neo nazi scene in austria mr s was mentioned as another convicted member of vapo who had also been released on parole a few weeks earlier it is not contested by the government that the news item concerned an issue of public interest consequently it related to a sphere in which restrictions on freedom of expression are to be strictly construed accordingly the court must exercise caution when the measures taken by the national authorities are such as to dissuade the media from taking part in the discussion of matters of public interest see for instance thoma v luxembourg no echr iii and jersild v denmark judgment of september series a no pp the court notes that the injunction granted by the domestic courts was phrased in broad terms it prohibited the applicant from showing mr ss picture in connection with any text mentioning his conviction under the prohibition act once the sentence has been executed or once he had been released on parole while the court agrees that there may be good reasons to prohibit the publication of a picture of a convicted person after his release on parole a number of elements are to be taken into account when weighing the individuals interest not to have his physical appearance disclosed against the public interest in the publication of his picture elements that will be relevant are the degree of notoriety of the person concerned the lapse of time since the conviction and the release the nature of the crime the connection between the contents of the report and the picture shown and the completeness and correctness of the accompanying text the domestic courts attached great weight to the timeelement in particular to the long lapse of time since mr ss conviction but did not pay any particular attention to the fact that only a few weeks had elapsed since his release they did not take into account his notoriety and the political nature of the crime of which he had been convicted nor did they have regard to other important elements namely that the facts mentioned in the news items were correct and complete and that the picture shown was related to the content of the report the latter elements distinguish the present case from a comparable case österreichischer rundfunk v austria dec no may which was declared inadmissible in that case the court found no indication of a violation of article as regards the prohibition to publish a convicts picture after his release on parole it had regard to the fact that the picture of b who had been convicted under the prohibition act had been shown in a different context namely in connection with the investigations in respect of a spectacular series of letter bomb attacks without mentioning that b had been acquitted of any involvement in these attacks and without mentioning that he had served his sentence under the prohibition act and had been released on paroleb application to the instant case in exercising its supervisory function the courts task is to review in the light of the case as a whole whether the decisions the domestic courts have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation have struck a fair balance between the rights at stake and ruled in accordance with the criteria established by it for that purpose see paragraphs and above accordingly the court will analyse in turn the elements identified as relevant in this regard in its caselaw and the domestic courts assessment thereofi contribution to a debate of general interest the court finds that the overall subject of the article namely the fact that the presidential candidate nh surrounded himself with an office manager rs who at least in the past had contacts with persons who had aimed at destroying the austrian constitutional order see österreichischer rundfunk cited above must be considered as having been of particular public interest at the time of its publication in this regard the court notes i the delicate point at which the article appeared during the presidential election in after the constitutional court had ruled unconstitutional a runoff ballot between the two candidates for the highest office of the republic and ii the particular public interest in the election process and the candidates at the time see paragraph above thus the court notes that there was little scope under article of the convention to restrict the applicant companys right to report on nhs election campaign see paragraph above while the news report in question see paragraph above served as such that particular interest by covering nhs political circles it did not itself even allege that there was any direct link between the presidential candidate and hs or that hs had played any role in the election campaign the only indirect connection between hs and nhs election campaign that could be understood from the article was that rs who is hss brother and nhs office manager had attended a neo nazi event in together with hs and gk both hs and gk had later undisputedly been criminally convicted under the prohibition act the vienna commercial court and the vienna court of appeal hence argued that they did not need to conduct a balancing exercise between the competing rights at stake in the instant case see paragraphs and above as hs was not the subject of the article and publishing the photo by mentioning that he was a convicted neo nazi therefore did not contribute to a debate of general interest the supreme court contrasted the instant case with the courts findings in the similar case of österreichischer rundfunk cited above and held that there was no temporal connection between the photograph hss criminal conviction in and the incriminated article which was published in see paragraph above it also referred to its reasoning in the provisional proceedings where it had found that the article impugned in the instant case had not concerned hs but only his brother rs there had thus been no objective justification for the reference to hss conviction see paragraph above considering that the applicant company did not either in the domestic proceedings see paragraph above or in its submissions to the court see paragraph above allege a direct link between nh and hs the court can accept the domestic courts conclusion that publishing hss photograph in a report on nhs political milieu with an incomplete accompanying text see paragraph below did not contribute to the debate on the election despite the particular public interest in the report as such see paragraph aboveii degree of notoriety of the person affected and subject of the news report the court reiterates that in its judgment österreichischer rundfunk cited above it has found that the plaintiff in the proceedings giving rise to that case hs who was also the plaintiff in the instant proceedings was a wellknown member of the neo nazi scene in austria the proceedings against him were among the most important ones conducted under the prohibition act at the time of his trial his picture had been widely published ibid the court notes moreover that vapo see paragraph above of which hs used to be a leading member before his conviction in aimed at nothing less than destroying the austrian constitutional order österreichischer rundfunk cited above and the court has already held in similar cases that a person expressing extremist views lays himself open to public scrutiny ibid and news verlags gmb h co kg cited above this must apply all the more to persons who did not only express extremist views but who committed severe crimes such as those under the prohibition act that run counter to the letter and the spirit of the convention see in this context mutatis mutandis witzsch v germany dec no december and the cases cited therein and more recently pastörs v germany no october the court attaches particular importance to the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society when reporting on crimes of that kind see paragraph above at the same time the court notes that at the time the report was published more than twenty years had passed since hss conviction and some seventeen years since his release see paragraphs and above and paragraph below compare and contrast österreichischer rundfunk cited above there is no indication in the parties submissions or in the documents submitted that hs sought the limelight after his release compare and contrast ml and ww v germany cited above where the applicants returned to the limelight after making several attempts to have their criminal proceedings reopened and after addressing the press on the subject for these reasons the court attaches weight to the fact that the applicant company while alleging that hss conviction and the circumstances that had led to it were of historical importance and that hs had not ceased his political activities in the neo nazi scene after his release from prison in see paragraph above and paragraph below did not even argue that hs was still a person of public interest and notoriety at the time of the publication of the photograph in in its submissions to the domestic courts it only referred to a wikipedia entry and another article concerning alleged events in the content of which were disputed by hs paragraphs above it neither specified hss conduct at these events nor elaborated on its submission that hs was an absolute person of contemporary history ibid this is all the more remarkable as hs had previously initiated proceedings against the applicant company in a similar context because of a different publication see paragraphs and above in that case the supreme court had already found in that hs had been fully reintegrated into society after his release see the supreme courts judgment from october ob s ibid in the absence of such specification the civil courts did not examine further the degree of notoriety of hs at the time of the publication while the court supports in general the applicant companys view that proceedings against neo nazis form an important part of judicial history in austria see paragraph above it can not be automatically concluded in the instant case that hss notoriety as an individual remained the same over the years see paragraphs above and below as regards the subject matter of the report the court has stated above that it did not relate to the criminal proceedings against hs or hss role in the election campaign see paragraphs aboveiii prior conduct of the person concerned according to the supreme courts findings see paragraphs and above which remained undisputed by the applicant company hs was reintegrated in society after his release and did not have any further criminal convictions after that of the applicant company as the defendant in the civil proceedings did not make any submissions regarding hss conduct after his conviction other than those dealt with in paragraph above for the reasons outlined above ibid the domestic civil courts were not obliged to go beyond those submissions and to assess in more detail hss conduct between his release in and the publication in iv method of obtaining the information and its veracity it was undisputed during the domestic proceedings and before the court that the statement made by the applicant company in connection with hs namely that he was a former convicted neo nazi was true incidentally this was one of the reasons why the domestic courts dismissed his claims for damages see paragraphs above the information itself can be considered common knowledge and is easily obtainable through an internet search typing in hss full name however with regard to the publication of a picture of a convicted person after his or her release on parole the court has found not only the correctness of the accompanying text to be a relevant element when weighing the individuals interest in not having his or her physical appearance disclosed against the publics interest in the publication of his or her picture but also the completeness of that text see österreichischer rundfunk cited above in the instant case the applicant companys report referred to hs as a convicted neo nazi without providing further details it did not inform the reader of the fact that the conviction referred to dated back to that hs had served his sentence and that he had not been convicted of a crime since the information that the conviction had in the meantime been expunged from his criminal record see paragraph above could have been ascertained by the applicant company by consulting the criminal record deletion act see paragraph above against this backdrop the court finds that the information provided by the applicant company in the text accompanying the photograph was true but not complete in respect of an essential point compare and contrast österreichischer rundfunk cited above where the court found that the facts mentioned in the news items had been correct and complete and that the picture shown had related to the content of the reportv content form and consequences of the publication of the article the court has examined the content and form of the news report together with the accompanying photograph when considering its contribution to a debate of general interest see paragraph above as to its consequences the court notes that hs as the plaintiff in the domestic proceedings did not allege that there had been any tangible consequences arising from the publication in question as stated above the domestic courts for that reason did not grant him the damages claimed see paragraphs and abovevi severity of the sanction imposed in the instant case the restriction imposed on the applicant company was of a very limited scope the applicant company was not sanctioned for the report or for the publication of the photograph either in civil or in criminal proceedings compare and contrast schwabe cited above where the applicant had been criminally convicted of defamation neither was it ordered to refrain completely in the future from publishing hss image without his consent compare and contrast mosley v the united kingdom no may or even from reporting on his trial in the applicant company was only prohibited from publishing hss picture if it was accompanied by the statement that he was a convicted neo nazi compare and contrast österreichischer rundfunk cited above where the national courts had ordered the applicant in that case to refrain from publishing hss picture without his consent if it was accompanied by any text stating that he had been convicted under the prohibition act once the sentence had been executed or he had been released on parole the applicant company had to reimburse hs for the costs of the domestic proceedings but there was no compensation awarded and no fine imposed see paragraphs above the court furthermore takes note of the fact that in its reasoning the supreme court referred to its judgment in previous proceedings case no ob s see paragraphs and above as stated above in that case the applicant company was ordered to refrain from publishing hss image without his consent only if the accompanying text described him as a neo nazi leader and did not state at the same time that he had already served his prison sentence and had behaved well since the court concludes from the supreme courts findings see paragraphs and above and in line with the governments submissions see paragraph above that in the instant case the applicant company had not met the criteria established by the supreme court in its previous judgment see paragraph above and by the court see paragraph abovevii the lapse of time between the conviction the release and the publication of the article in question in the case of österreichischer rundfunk cited above the court has held that another element to be taken into account within the context of the publication of an image of a convicted person after his or her release was the time that had lapsed since the conviction and the release in that case ibid the court found a violation of article as the domestic courts had not taken into account among other things see paragraph above that only a short time had passed since hss release at the time of the publication of the article that was the subject of that case see paragraph above the instant case can be distinguished from the case of österreichischer rundfunk cited above in respect of that point as in the meantime over twenty years had passed between hss criminal conviction in and the publication of the article at issue and some seventeen years since his release in see paragraph above the court notes that the supreme court referring to the courts caselaw explicitly pointed out this lack of temporal connection see paragraph above within this context the court considers it important to take into account the fact that hss conviction under the prohibition act had already been deleted from his criminal record at the time of the publication in question see paragraph above while is does not lose sight of the severe political nature of the crime committed by hs before and of the danger with regard to attacks on democracy if journalists are hindered from reporting on the crimes of neo nazis see paragraph above in fine these considerations have to be weighed against the importance of the reintegration into society of persons who have been released from prison after serving their sentence and their legitimate and very significant interest after a certain period of time in no longer being confronted with their conviction see paragraph above this is what hs essentially argued in the domestic proceedings see paragraph abovec conclusion the court reiterates that the member states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed under that provision is necessary see paragraph above in the instant case while the vienna commercial court and the vienna court of appeal concluded from the supreme courts reasoning in the provisional proceedings see paragraph above that a balancing of interests did not have to be carried out see paragraphs and above the supreme court did in fact balance the competing interests at stake and by doing so examined the case on the basis of the criteria that were established by the courts own judgment in the case of österreichischer rundfunk cited above which had also concerned hs the supreme court noted that the article had not concerned hs but only his brother rs and that the text accompanying hss photograph had lacked the information that he had meanwhile served his sentence and had behaved well since see paragraphs and above thus in contrast with the facts underlying the above mentioned judgment in the present case the published picture was not related to the content of the report and the accompanying text was correct but not complete see paragraphs and above the supreme court further noted citing the case of österreichischer rundfunk that there was no temporal connection between the photograph taken in hss criminal conviction in and the applicant company calling him a convicted neo nazi in the impugned article of see paragraph above as regards the notoriety of hs the court has already noted that the applicant company did not substantiate its submissions in this regard within this context there was no reason for the civil courts to carry out a detailed examination of whether hs was still a person of public interest and notoriety see paragraphs and above the court further notes that the applicant companys allegation that hs was still active in the rightwing scene was not supported by any evidence other than two reports referring to his participation in events in while it did not dispute the fact that hs had not been convicted again after his release in ibid on the basis of these facts the court can accept that the domestic courts for the purpose of the civil claim did not assess the question of hss conduct between and in more detail ibid as stated above the court is mindful of the essential role played by the press in protecting democracy which includes notably reporting on presidential candidates their social and political environment and in this context on certain crimes see paragraphs and above however having analysed the relevant elements see paragraph above the court notes that the domestic courts did not generally prevent the applicant company from reporting on hs and on the serious crimes once committed by him but only prohibited it to publish hss picture if at the same time he was called a convicted neo nazi in the accompanying report see paragraphs above in its reasoning the supreme court emphasized that in a context as the present one the connection between the contents of the report and the picture as well as the completeness and correctness of the accompanying text had to be among other things considered ibid the content of the article published by the applicant company did not concern hs see paragraph above and the information given by the applicant company was not complete see paragraph above therefore the court can not but conclude that in the specific circumstances of the case the reasons adduced by the domestic courts were undertaken in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw and were relevant and sufficient to justify the interference it sees no strong reasons to substitute the domestic courts views with its own see the caselaw quoted in paragraph above it follows that the interference was necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the courtdeclares unanimously the application admissible holds by four votes to three that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on april pursuant to rule and of the rules of court ilse freiwirth yonko grozev deputy registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the dissenting opinion of judge guerra martins joined by judges vehabović and motoc is annexed to this judgment ygrif dissenting opinion of judge guerra martins joined by judges vehabović and motocwith all due respect to my colleagues i am unable to subscribe to their view that article has not been violated the main legal issue in this case is to assess whether the decisions of the domestic courts struck a fair balance between the competing rights at stake the freedom of expression and the publics freedom of information under article the right to respect for ones private life and the right to protection of ones own image under article of the convention and ruled in accordance with the criteria established by the court for that purpose it is not unusual that in cases raising issues of conflicts of rights where a fair balance must be struck between two different rights it may be difficult to draw a clear dividing line between violation and nonviolation because it depends on the weight that each person gives to each individual criterion and to all of them together as for striking a balance between the freedom of expression and the right to respect for ones private life the court already has wellestablished criteria for doing so it goes without saying that i do not wish to depart from those criteria accordingly i can accept the reasoning of the majority concerning some of the criteria for example the part of the judgment on how wellknown the person affected by the news was in my opinion however the majority underestimated other criteria for instance the contribution to a debate of general interest and the veracity of the information and also overestimated others for example the lapse of time between the conviction the release and the publication of the information in short my main divergence with the majority concerns the assessment of the first criterion relating to the contribution to a debate of general interest i can not accept the domestic courts conclusion that publishing hss photo in a report on nhs political milieu did not contribute to a debate of general interest ie the debate on the election in my view given that the article drew attention to the neo nazi past of someone who might still be close to a presidential candidate even if it is highly unlikely the public has the right to have access to that information in principle an elector with access to all the relevant information is betterplaced and freer to choose between two or more candidates than an elector who lacks that information this assertion is even more valid in the context of the election in question which had been disputed and was subject to a decision of the constitutional court declaring the first election void the runoff ballot thus had to be repeated to put it differently while for the majority publishing hss photograph in a report on nhs political milieu with an incomplete accompanying text did not contribute to the debate on the election despite the particular public interest in the report as such for me on the one hand the particular context of those elections justified the broadest possible diffusion of information by the media on the candidates and their entourage and on the other hand that context meant that it was quite important for the public to know who might be supporting each candidate in my opinion democracy has to protect itself from certain political parties and persons who want to destroy it membership of a neo nazi party is such a serious threat to democracy that the mere suspicion that a presidential candidate might have such individuals among hisher supporters is ample justification for publishing the photograph in question i would take the view that the domestic courts did not have regard to the importance of the media in protecting democracy particularly where the neo nazi ideology is concerned the courts attached greater importance for instance to the lapse of time between the conviction the release and the publication of the article than to the information itself for me by contrast the neo nazi past of a person who might could still have a slight connection to a politician standing for president in a democratic country even if that connection is minimal is important even if there is a long lapse of time between hisher neo nazi past and the election additionally i can not follow the majority as regards the scant importance which it attached to the veracity of the facts concentrating much more on the fact that the news was not complete for me on the contrary the veracity of the facts is crucial the omission of some aspects does not undermine such veracity to conclude my divergencies with the majority have led me to conclude that there was a violation of article of the convention,,,
58,the applicant is a registered association which has its seat in vienna its aim is to research and study past and present transfers of ownership of agricultural and forest land in order to reach conclusions as to the impact of such transfers on society the applicant association also gives opinions on draft laws falling within its field of interest in essence agricultural and forest land transactions require approval by local and regional authorities the latter are called regional real property transactions commissions landes grundverkehrskommissionen the aim of this requirement laid down in the real property transactions acts of the länder is to preserve land for agricultural use and forestry and in some of the regions including tyrol to avoid the proliferation of second homes the applicant association states that it is sent all decisions issued by the regional real property transactions commissions with the exception of the one for tyrol in the decisions it receives the names of parties and other sensitive data are usually anonymised on april the association asked the tyrol real property transactions commission the commission to provide by mail all decisions issued since january in anonymised form the costs thereof to be reimbursed by letter of july the commission replied that it could not comply with the request owing to lack of time and personnel on july the applicant association submitted a further request this time requesting the provision by mail of all decisions issued since january in anonymised form in the event of refusal of the application it demanded a formal decision in accordance with the tyrol access to information act tiroler auskunftspflichtgesetz the information act the applicant association argued that since the commissions decisions concerned civil rights within the meaning of article of the convention the decisions should be either publicly announced or made public by other appropriate means in its decision of october the commission rejected the request holding that the transmission of anonymised copies of its decisions did not constitute information within the meaning of section of the information act which defines information as existing knowledge on matters known to the authority at the time it provides the information moreover even if the request were to fall within the scope of that provision the information act stated that pursuant to section subparagraph c there was no duty to provide the information if doing so would require so many resources that the functioning of the authority would be affected the decision stated that complaints could be lodged with the constitutional court verfassungsgerichtshof and the administrative court verwaltungsgerichtshof the applicant association complained to both the constitutional court and the administrative court it relied on article of the convention in its submissions in reply to the applicant associations complaint to the constitutional court and the administrative court the commission maintained that its decisions did not constitute information within the meaning of the information act it argued that a decision contained the facts of the case and the legal conclusions the authority had drawn from them legal arguments could be discussed and decisions could be challenged and set aside if the legal conclusions were found to be wrong therefore giving someone access to a decision was comparable to giving someone legal advice as opposed to providing information as defined in the information act on september the administrative court declared that it did not have jurisdiction to deal with the case and rejected the applicant associations complaint the administrative court held that it was only competent to deal with complaints against decisions regarding transfers of building plots and not with complaints brought against the commissions decisions on transfers of agricultural or forest land as the applicant association had not claimed to have been party to the transfer of a building plot it could not base its complaint on that status neither did the information act contain any rule stating that complaints about decisions by the commission pursuant to the information act were to be lodged with the administrative court therefore the matter was excluded from the administrative courts jurisdiction consequently the statement in the commissions decision that a complaint could be lodged with the administrative court was not correct on february the constitutional court declined to deal with the case for lack of prospects of success from the perspective of constitutional law and also because the matter was not excluded from the administrative courts jurisdiction the decision was served on the associations representative on april after the government had been notified of the present application the applicant association relying on the governments argument in respect of exhaustion of domestic remedies see paragraph below lodged an application under article of the federal constitution seeking a ruling from the constitutional court on the negative conflict of jurisdiction between it and the administrative court on december the constitutional court issued a decision stating that it was competent to rule on the applicant associations complaint against the commissions decision of october consequently it set aside its own decision of february and awarded the applicant association reimbursement of the costs of the proceedings in a further decision of december the constitutional court ruled on the merits of the applicant associations complaint referring to the courts caselaw and its own caselaw it held in particular that whilst the right to receive information enshrined in article of the convention prohibited states from restricting the receipt of information that others wished to or might be willing to impart it did not by contrast impose a positive obligation on states to collect and disseminate information of their own motion the constitutional court added that in accordance with its established caselaw article did not require the state to grant access to information or to make information available of its own motion consequently the commissions refusal to transmit anonymised copies of all decisions issued during a specific period of time to the applicant association did not constitute an interference with the latters right under article of the convention as to the applicant associations argument that the commissions decision was arbitrary as it had failed to provide reasons the constitutional court referred to the explanatory report on the information act and endorsed the commissions view that the applicant associations request was not merely a question of obtaining information about one or more specific issues but would require the commission to compile of its own motion all decisions issued over a period of some years to anonymise them and to send paper copies thereof to the applicant association the commission had therefore rightly taken the view that the applicant associations request did not fall within the scope of section of the information act moreover the commission had also dealt with the merits of the request in that it had concluded that the provision of information could be refused pursuant to section subparagraph c of the information act as it would require investigations calculations or preparations considerably impinging on the fulfilment of its other tasks lastly the constitutional court observed that the applicant association could be implicitly relying also on article of the convention it noted that neither the courts caselaw in respect of public access to court decisions nor its own caselaw guaranteed the right to obtain anonymised copies of all decisions issued by the commission over a lengthy period according to the constitutional courts caselaw access had to be given to the judgments delivered by the highest courts which dealt with cases raising important legal issues however this did not apply to all the commissions decisions ii relevant domestic law and practicea the information act the information act regional law gazette regulates the duty of the authority to provide information section provides as follows the authority of the land municipalities municipal associations and any other selfgoverning bodies regulated by regional law are under an obligation to provide anyone with information about their sphere of competence unless provided otherwise in section information is the notification of existing knowledge on matters known to the authority at the time it provides the information section in so far as relevant provides as follows anyone may require authorities of the land municipalities municipal associations and any other selfgoverning bodies regulated by regional law to provide information orally in writing or by phone telex or telegraph section in so far as relevant provides as follows no information shall be provided if the provision of such information is contradictory to a statutory duty of confidentiality there is no duty to provide information ifc the provision of information would require investigations calculations or preparations considerably impinging on the proper fulfilment of the authoritys other tasks b the tyrol real property transactions act the aim of the tyrol real property transactions act as in force at the material time regional law gazette as amended by regional law gazette was to preserve land for agricultural and forestry use and to avoid the proliferation of second homes contracts concerning the transfer of ownership and certain other rights relating to agricultural or forest land therefore required approval by local real property transactions authorities appeals against their decisions could be lodged with the commission either by the parties if they considered the decision had violated their rights or by the regional real property transactions referee grundverkehrsreferent if he considered that the decision ran contrary to the public interest a complaint could be lodged with the constitutional court against decisions of the commission relating to the transfer of agricultural and forest land if approval was declined the transfer of land was null and void the regional real property transactions commission was composed of nine members and substitute members who were appointed for five years and were not bound in the exercise of their functions by any instructions as a rule the commission held oral hearings in public an annual report on the situation of real property transfers in tyrol published by the regional government includes a report containing general information on the commissions activities it can be seen from these reports that in the period from to between and appeals per year were lodged with the commission the majority of which concerned transfers of agricultural and forest land it can also be seen that the commission issued decisions in decisions in decisions in decisions in decisions in and decisions in the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant association complained that its right to receive information had been violated as it was refused access to the decisions of the tyrol real property transactions commission the applicant association relied on article which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the government had initially argued that the applicant association had not exhausted domestic remedies since it had failed to make use of an application under article b of the federal constitution in order to resolve the negative conflict of jurisdiction which resulted from the administrative courts decision of september and the constitutional courts decision of february as the applicant association subsequently requested that the constitutional court rule on that conflict of jurisdiction and obtained a decision by the constitutional court on the merits on december see paragraph above the government withdrew their objection based on the nonexhaustion of domestic remedies the court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions the applicant association asserted that article of the convention required states to a certain extent to make information available to the public in its view the decisions of judicial bodies such as the commission should be publicly accessible given the possibilities of electronic data processing the authorities could easily create an online information system providing access to the decisions of the commission while making provision for the protection of confidential data where necessary such a system namely the federal legal information system rechtsinformationssystem des bundes existed at federal level and made decisions of the highest courts and various other courts and authorities available where such a system did not exist the state should at least provide anonymised paper copies of decisions upon request regarding the governments argument that austrian administrative law did not make provision for unrestricted access to files the applicant association submitted that it had not requested access to files but rather the provision of decisions in anonymised form in the applicant associations view such interference with its right to receive information could not be justified it asserted that interests in the rule of law and due process argued in favour of making decisions by judicial authorities available to the public while the interests of confidentiality could be protected by anonymising them in response to the governments argument that granting the request would have demanded considerable effort the applicant association criticised the fact that the commission had not provided any figures indicating the number of decisions to be made available or the actual amount of time needed to provide anonymised copies the government argued that the commissions refusal to provide anonymised paper copies of all decisions issued since january could not be regarded as an interference with the applicant associations rights under article according to the courts caselaw article of the convention prohibited contracting states from interfering with the receipt of information that someone wished to impart however it did not impose a positive obligation on the state to collect and disseminate information itself although the state had to set up its information system in such a way that an individual could obtain generally accessible information it was not obliged to provide access to confidential information access to files containing decisions issued in administrative proceedings was usually given only to parties with a special legal interest in the specific case the applicant association could not claim to have a special interest in all decisions issued by the commission over a lengthy period thus the refusal to provide anonymised copies of all decisions issued since january did not constitute an interference with its rights under article of the convention moreover a right to be provided with all decisions issued by the commission over a lengthy period could not be inferred from article of the convention either in the alternative assuming that there had in fact been an interference with the applicant associations rights under article the government asserted that such interference had been justified they pointed out in particular that it served legitimate aims it protected the rights of others namely their interest in nondisclosure of the contents of proceedings affecting them personally which might for instance include personal data concerning the location and price of land that had been purchased and prevented the disclosure of confidential information moreover it served to preserve the proper functioning of the authority concerned had the applicant associations request been granted compliance with it would have required substantial resources to anonymise numerous decisions issued over a number of years and would thus have jeopardised the fulfillment of the commissions main tasks a weighing up of interests showed that this latter interest had to prevail over the applicant associations interest in obtaining access to all these decisions in anonymised form consequently the interference had also been proportionate the courts assessmenta whether there has been an interference the court has consistently recognised that the public has a right to receive information of general interest its caselaw in this field has been developed in relation to press freedom the purpose of which is to impart information and ideas on such matters the court has emphasised that the most careful scrutiny on its part is called for when measures taken by the national authorities may potentially discourage the participation of the press one of societys watchdogs in the public debate on matters of legitimate public concern see társaság a szabadságjogokért v hungary no april with references to observer and guardian v the united kingdom november series a no thorgeir thorgeirson v iceland june series a no jersild v denmark september series a no and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii furthermore the court has held that the gathering of information is an essential preparatory step in journalism and an inherent protected part of press freedom see dammann v switzerland no april however the function of creating forums for public debate is not limited to the press that function may also be exercised by nongovernmental organisations the activities of which are an essential element of informed public debate the court has therefore accepted that nongovernmental organisations like the press may be characterised as social watchdogs in that connection their activities warrant similar convention protection to that afforded to the press see társaság a szabadságjogokért cited above and animal defenders international v the united kingdom gc no april the applicant association is a nongovernmental organisation the aim of which is to research the impact of transfers of ownership of agricultural and forest land on society it also contributes to the legislative process by submitting comments on draft laws falling within its field of expertise in the present case it wished to obtain information about the decisions of the commission that is to say the appellate authority approving or refusing transfers of agricultural and forest land under the tyrol real property transactions act the aims pursued by that act namely preserving land for agricultural and forestry use and avoiding the proliferation of second homes are subjects of general interest the applicant association was therefore involved in the legitimate gathering of information of public interest its aim was to carry out research and to submit comments on draft laws thereby contributing to public debate consequently there has been an interference with the applicant associations right to receive and to impart information as enshrined in article of the convention see társaság a szabadságjogokért cited above see also kenedi v hungary no may b whether the interference was justified the court reiterates that an interference with an applicants rights under article will infringe the convention if it does not meet the requirements of paragraph of article it should therefore be determined whether it was prescribed by law whether it pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in that paragraph and whether it was necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve those aims in dismissing the applicant associations request the commission relied on sections and subparagraph c of the information act the court is thus satisfied that the interference at issue was prescribed by law within the meaning of article of the convention the government argued that the interference served legitimate aims namely the protection of the rights of others and the nondisclosure of confidential information the applicant association argued that these interests could have been protected by anonymising the copies of the decision the court considers that the interference in question can be seen as having pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the rights of others the court must examine whether the interference was also necessary within the meaning of article in respect of the general principles concerning the necessity of an interference with the right to freedom of expression the court refers to its recent judgment in the case of animal defenders international cited above in the specific context of access to information the court has held that the right to receive information basically prohibits a government from preventing a person from receiving information that others wished or were willing to impart see leander v sweden march series a no furthermore it has held that the right to receive information can not be construed as imposing on a state positive obligations to collect and disseminate information of its own motion see guerra and others v italy february reports of judgments and decisions i however in társaság a szabadságjogokért which concerned a request for access to information by a nongovernmental organisation for the purposes of contributing to public debate the court noted that it had recently advanced towards a broader interpretation of the notion of the freedom to receive information and thereby towards the recognition of a right of access to information cited above furthermore it drew a parallel to its caselaw concerning the freedom of the press stating that the most careful scrutiny was called for when authorities enjoying an information monopoly interfered with the exercise of the function of a social watchdog ibid with reference to chauvy and others v france no echr vi in the present case the applicant association requested paper copies of all decisions issued by the commission from january to mid it argued in essence that the state had an obligation either to publish all decisions of the commission in an electronic database or to provide it with anonymised paper copies upon request the court does not consider that a general obligation of this scope can be inferred from its caselaw under article however its task in the present case is to examine whether the reasons given by the domestic authorities for refusing the applicant associations request were relevant and sufficient in the specific circumstances of the case and whether the interference was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued both the commission and the constitutional court relied on a twofold argument firstly they considered that the applicant associations request did not fall within the scope of the information act secondly they argued that even if it did the request could be refused on the grounds that its fulfilment would require substantial resources which would jeopardise the fulfilment of the commissions other tasks the constitutional court noted in particular that the applicant associations request was not concerned with obtaining information on one or more specific issues but would have required the commission to compile of its own motion all decisions issued over a period of some years to anonymise them and to send paper copies thereof to the applicant association the government also relied on this line of argument the court observes that there is a difference between the present case and társaság a szabadságjogokért which concerned a request by a nongovernmental organisation to be given access to a particular document a constitutional complaint for the review of certain provisions of the criminal code lodged by a member of parliament in reaching its conclusion that the refusal of access was in breach of article the court had regard to the fact that the information sought was ready and available and did not necessitate the collection of any data by the government see társaság a szabadságjogokért cited above however in assessing whether the interference complained of in the present case was necessary within the meaning of article the court must consider all the circumstances of the case the court notes that the applicant association by requesting anonymised copies of the commissions decisions accepted that the decisions at issue contained personal data which would have to be removed before the decisions could be made available it also understood that the production and mailing of the requested copies involved a certain cost which it proposed to reimburse nevertheless the applicant associations request met with an unconditional refusal given that the commission is a public authority deciding disputes over civil rights within the meaning of article of the convention see eisenstecken v austria no echr x with further references which are moreover of considerable public interest the court finds it striking that none of the commissions decisions was published whether in an electronic database or in any other form consequently much of the anticipated difficulty referred to by the commission as a reason for its refusal to provide the applicant association with copies of numerous decisions given over a lengthy period was generated by its own choice not to publish any of its decisions in this context the court notes the applicant associations submission which has not been disputed by the government that it receives anonymised copies of decisions from all other regional real property commissions without any particular difficulties in sum the court finds that the reasons relied on by the domestic authorities in refusing the applicant associations request for access to the commissions decisions though relevant were not sufficient while it is not for the court to establish in which manner the commission could and should have granted the applicant association access to its decisions it finds that a complete refusal to give it access to any of its decisions was disproportionate the commission which by its own choice held an information monopoly in respect of its decisions thus made it impossible for the applicant association to carry out its research in respect of one of the nine austrian länder namely tyrol and to participate in a meaningful manner in the legislative process concerning amendments of real property transaction law in tyrol the court therefore concludes that the interference with the applicant associations right to freedom of expression can not be regarded as having been necessary in a democratic society there has accordingly been a violation of article of the convention ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant association complained that it did not have an effective remedy in respect of its complaint under article it relied on article of the convention which reads as follows everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in the convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity the government contested that argument the court notes that this complaint is linked to the one examined above and must therefore likewise be declared admissible the applicant association asserted that in their respective decisions of september and february the administrative court and the constitutional court had refused to examine the merits of its complaint concerning the commissions refusal to provide it with copies of all decisions issued over a specified period of time the government submitted that a complaint to the constitutional court constituted an effective remedy even a refusal to deal with a complaint entailed a summary examination of the subject matter moreover in the present case the applicant association had had the possibility of challenging the constitutional courts refusal to deal with the case by lodging an application under article of the federal constitution in order to resolve the negative conflict of jurisdiction between the administrative court and the constitutional court as the court has held on many occasions article of the convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order the effect of article is thus to require provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an arguable complaint under the convention and to grant appropriate relief the scope of the contracting states obligations under article varies depending on the nature of the applicants complaint however the remedy required by article must be effective in practice as well as in law the effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of article does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant see for instance kudła v poland no echr xi the court therefore has to examine whether austrian law afforded the applicant association the possibility of complaining about the alleged violation of its right to freedom of expression and whether this remedy was effective in the sense that it could have afforded appropriate redress for the alleged violation the court observes that the administrative court held that it was not competent to deal with the applicant associations complaint the constitutional court in its turn also refused to deal with the case making the assumption that the case was not excluded from the administrative courts jurisdiction however the applicant association had the possibility of bringing an application under article of the federal constitution which allowed this negative conflict of jurisdiction to be resolved it made use of this option with the result that the constitutional court set aside its previous decision and ruled on the merits of the applicant associations complaint under article the fact that the outcome was not favourable for the applicant association does not detract from the effectiveness of the remedy the court is therefore satisfied that the applicant association had an effective remedy at its disposal in respect of its complaint under article consequently there has been no violation of article of the convention iii application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court finds that there has been a violation of the convention or the protocols thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party a costs and expenses whereas the applicant association did not claim compensation for pecuniary or nonpecuniary damage in its observations of august it claimed a total of euros eur for the costs and expenses incurred in the domestic proceedings comprising eur for expenses incurred before the commission eur for costs and expenses incurred before the administrative court and eur for costs and expenses incurred in the first set of proceedings before the constitutional court the applicant association also claimed costs for a further set of proceedings to be conducted before the constitutional court under article of the federal constitution unless such costs were to be reimbursed by the constitutional court in respect of the convention proceedings the applicant association claimed adequate compensation for the cost of representation without specifying an amount the government observed that the applicant association had failed to substantiate the expenses it claimed to have incurred before the commission they noted the claim for reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred before the administrative court and for the first set of proceedings before the constitutional court without making any further comment moreover they observed that the costs of a possible further set of proceedings before the constitutional court had not yet been actually incurred lastly the government submitted that the applicant association had failed to substantiate the costs claimed in respect of the convention proceedings as required they observed that the applicants submissions before the court were in any event largely similar to those already made before the domestic authorities according to the courts caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum in the present case taking into account the documents in its possession and the above criteria the court awards a total amount of eur for the costs incurred in the proceedings before the administrative court and the first set of proceedings before the constitutional court it notes that in the second set of proceedings before the constitutional court the applicant association was awarded reimbursement of its costs and has not made any further claims in that respect in the proceedings before the court furthermore the court dismisses the remainder of the claim for costs and expenses in the domestic proceedings and considers it reasonable to award the sum of eur for the proceedings before the court consequently the court rounding up the amount awards a total of eur under the head of costs and expenses b default interest the court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the european central bank to which should be added three percentage points for these reasons the court declares unanimously the application admissible holds by six votes to one that there has been a violation of article of the convention holds unanimously that there has been no violation of article of the convention holds unanimouslya that the respondent state is to pay the applicant association within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with article of the convention eur seven thousand five hundred euros plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant in respect of costs and expensesb that from the expiry of the abovementioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage points dismisses unanimously the remainder of the applicant associations claim for just satisfaction done in english and notified in writing on november pursuant to rule and of the rules of court søren nielsen isabelle berro lefèvre registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the separate opinion of judge møse is annexed to this judgment iblsnpartly dissenting opinion of judge møse i agree that for the reasons set out in the judgment there was no violation of article but can not follow my colleagues in finding that article has been violated see paragraphs to of the judgment the general principles concerning freedom of expression are well known and have been summarised for instance in mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no july it is also common ground that the press exercises a vital role of public watchdog in imparting information of serious public concern when measures are taken or sanctions imposed by national authorities in such matters the most careful scrutiny on the part of the court is called for see among many authorities bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no and echr iii the grand chamber has accepted that when a nongovernmental organisation ngo draws attention to matters of public interest it is exercising a public watchdog role of similar importance to that of the press see animal defenders international v the united kingdom gc no april i agree with this point of departure however whether there is a violation or not depends on a concrete assessment in animal defenders which concerned the prohibition of paid political advertising on radio and television the majority did not find a breach of article at chamber level an ngos role as a watchdog was raised in vides aizsardzibas klubs v latvia no may steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii and riolo v italy no july which related to a researcher in political science writing a newspaper article the facts in those cases are very different from the present case as regards access to information i agree with the initial recapitulation of relevant case law in paragraph of the judgment including the references to leander v sweden march series a no and guerra and others v italy february reports of judgments and decisions i the majority then refer to társaság a szabadságjogokért v hungary no april which concerned access to information by an ngo in my view that case does not support a finding of a violation in the present case see paragraphs below in paragraphs of the judgment reference is made to dammann v switzerland no april the case of társaság a szabadságjogokért cited above and and kenedi v hungary no may the first judgment concerns the conviction of a journalist who had taken certain preparatory steps to obtain information in alleged breach of the swiss penal code and is clearly distinguishable from the present case nor is the third judgment comparable the applicant a historian had obtained a court judgment granting him access to certain documents deposited with the ministry of the interior in spite of subsequent court decisions in line with the original judgment the authorities obstructed his access as mentioned by the majority see paragraph of the judgment the case of társaság a szabadságjogokért cited above concerned a request by an ngo to be given access to a particular document a constitutional complaint the court found that the refusal of access was in breach of article taking into account that the information sought was ready and available and did not require the collection of any data by the government ibid with reference to guerra and others cited above moreover the court held in that case that private data protection considerations could not justify the interference ibid by contrast the request made by the applicant association in the present case required the provision of anonymised paper copies of all decisions by the tyrol real property commission issued over a period of more than five years the decisions were not in a state to be sent it appears that the applicant association itself by requesting anonymised copies understood that the decisions concerned contained personal data which would have to be removed before they could be made available the commission refused the request on the grounds that its fulfilment even if it were accepted that it fell within the scope of the information act would require substantial resources which would jeopardise the fulfilment of the commissions other tasks the constitutional court endorsed this line of argument finding that the commission would have to compile all the decisions anonymise them and send paper copies to the applicant association it is noteworthy that according to the annual report published by the regional government the commission issued between and decisions per year in the relevant period from to see paragraph of the judgment the applicant associations request therefore related to several hundred decisions in my view there was thus no arbitrariness in the argument that complying with the applicant associations request would have had a negative impact on the fulfillment of the commissions tasks i therefore accept that the reasons given for the refusal of the applicant associations request were relevant and sufficient lastly it should be noted that the applicant association is not left completely without any possibility to obtain information about the commissions decisions a certain amount of information is available in the regional governments annual report moreover the commission is not an authority of last resort a complaint against its decisions can be lodged with the constitutional court and a collection of the latters decisions which as a rule contain a summary of the challenged decision is published in an online database the federal legal information system consequently the interference with the applicant associations right under article was also proportionate in my view these considerations lead to the conclusion that the domestic authorities did not overstep their margin of appreciation when refusing the applicant associations request the fact that all other regional real property commissions sent out anonymised copies is not sufficient to alter that conclusion there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for citation purposes the short title

59,the applicant company is a limited liability company established under austrian law with its registered office in innsbruck it publishes bezirksblatt lokalausgabe hall rum the bezirksblatt a weekly newspaper distributed free of charge in a region of tyrol one edition of the newspaper had copies circulated in january approximately copies of an anonymous letter were sent out many of them to members of the supervisory board of the tourism association for hall and wattens two towns in tyrol the letter written in the form of a survey concerned cm and jm referred to as mm on account of the initial letter of their surname cm was at the time a practising lawyer and chairman of the tourism association for hall and wattens when the article was published elections for the post of chairman of the tourism association were underway and cm was again standing as a candidate for the post his brother jm also a practising lawyer had been active in politics in hall for many years and was at the material time the member of the city council responsible for public finance he was also chairman of the supervisory board of stadtwerke hall the towns electricity water and heating supplier the survey part of the letter read in the course of our mm survey i would like to ask you the following questions would you buy a car from this man would you stake your money on a promise made by this man does this man have the necessary personal professional qualifications has this man ever built anything properly is this man honest with his own family would you allow this man to execute your will if you have answered one of these questions with no please ask yourself why you want to leave this man in his current position we being entrepreneurs will decide at the next tourism association meeting with our votes it is our promise our money our qualification our association and our heritage l a journalist working for the applicant companys newspaper was informed of the anonymous letter he telephoned cm and jm who commented on it claiming it to be part of a political campaign against them a few minutes later cm telephoned the journalist back and asked him whether he was planning to publish the letter when l confirmed that he was cm said that he did not agree to its publication and that he would take legal action if it were published in the january issue of the bezirksblatt the applicant company published an article entitled anonymous campaign against mm the subheading read mm or cms and jms full surname are the target of a not at all bittersweet campaign the article contained the story of the anonymous letter and cms and jms replies to the accusations made in it it reported that both of them had stated that the letter had attempted to harm their political activities and had considered the accusations to be a personal insult the article contained photos of cm and jm and a reproduction of the letter containing the questions set out above relying on section of the media act cm and jm brought proceedings against the applicant company for defamation requesting compensation and publication of the judgment the applicant company argued that its conduct did not amount to defamation as the article had only quoted someone elses statements and had duly distanced itself from the contents of the letter moreover the information had been a matter of public interest on march the innsbruck regional court found in favour of the claimants and ordered the applicant company to publish the judgment and to pay eur in compensation to each of them the regional court held that the article itself merely commented on the letter in an objective manner and did not agree with its offensive content furthermore the nature of the offices held by the claimants meant that they were often in the local media but had so far not been the subject of any negative campaign however the anonymous letter which had been included in the article fulfilled the actus reus of defamation as it accused cm and jm of dishonesty and other disreputable character traits relating to both their professional and private lives both had experienced negative repercussions as a result of the article in their professional activities as lawyers in that they had repeatedly been confronted with the allegations made in the anonymous letter the regional court referring to the applicant companys argument that it had only quoted a statement made by someone else noted that section of the media act only permitted quoting the statement of a third person if the quotation was truthful and there was an overriding public interest in its publication this rule would even apply if the identity of the third person having made the statement was unknown in any case the court held that it was required to balance the public interest in disseminating information about the statements quoted against the claimants interest in protecting their reputation it accepted that the local public had an interest in knowing about a campaign against the chairman of the tourism association and a local politician however public interest did not justify reproduction of the anonymous letter in the article the applicant company could have provided information on the campaign against cm and jm without printing the defamatory letter in that connection the court observed that by printing the letter the applicant had also made its entire content known to a far greater number of people than the letter itself had reached the applicant company appealed and lodged a plea of nullity relying on the media act in particular on the socalled law on quotations developed under section of that act it asserted that the regional court had wrongly considered there to be no overriding public interest in publishing the anonymous letter in particular the article and the letter related to the tourism association which was a public law corporation and the applicants were both public figures in local politics the innsbruck court of appeal dismissed the appeal on august it held that the law on quotations was not applicable in the present case it was not possible to claim for damages under article of the media act in respect of quotations in the media where the identity of the third person making the offensive statements was known in such cases the person concerned could seek compensation from the person who had made the offensive statements in the first place as in the present case the person who had made the offensive statements had remained anonymous the applicant company could not rely on section of the media act furthermore the court of appeal confirming the regional courts view found that in any event there was no overriding public interest in publication of the anonymous letter the judgment was served on the applicants counsel on january ii relevant domestic law and practice section of the media act provides for the strict liability of the publisher in cases of defamation the victim can thus claim damages from the publisher section in so far as material reads as follows where a medium publishes statements which constitute the actus reus of disparagement insult derision or defamation the victim shall have a claim against the owner of the medium publisher for damages for the injury suffered the right referred to in paragraph above shall not apply in the case of defamationa where the statements published are true orb where there was an overriding public interest in publication and the requisite journalistic diligence having been observed there were sufficient reasons to believe that the statement was true where a truthful quotation of a statement made by a third person is concerned and there was an overriding public interest in knowing about the statement quoted for the purpose of section of the media act defamation is to be understood as defined in article of the criminal code strafgesetzbuch which reads as follows anybody who in such a way that it may be noticed by a third person attributes to another a contemptible characteristic or sentiment or accuses him of behaviour contrary to honour or morality and such as to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six months or a fine anyone who commits this offence in a printed document by broadcasting or otherwise in such a way as to make the defamation accessible to a broad section of the public shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine the person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true in the case of the offence defined in paragraph he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to believe that the statement was true the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant company complained that the courts judgments had violated its right to freedom of expression it relied on article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissionsa the applicant company the applicant company maintained that the interference with its right to freedom of expression was not necessary in a democratic society as required by article of the convention in particular it asserted that the article had been published in the context of the upcoming elections of the chairman of the local tourism association and had contributed to a debate of general interest moreover cm and jm were public figures on account of their activities in the political scene and the nature of the offices held by them the applicant company also submitted that the courts had failed to evaluate the reproduction of the anonymous letter against the background of the article as a whole which gave room to the statements of the two people concerned and duly distanced itself from the accusations made against them furthermore the applicant company citing albert engelmann gesellschaft mb h v austria no january contested the domestic courts view that the reproduction of an anonymous letter had to be distinguished from the quotation of a third persons statementb the government the government pointed out in the first place that the domestic courts had not prevented the applicant company from publishing the article itself they had ordered it to pay compensation to cm and jm only in respect of the publication of the anonymous letter furthermore they submitted that the interference with the applicant companys right to freedom of expression was based on law and served a legitimate aim namely the protection of the reputation and rights of others in that connection they noted that the anonymous letter which the applicant company had published in the bezirksblatt accused cm and jm gratuitously of dishonesty and other reprehensible character traits and had therefore interfered with their rights under article of the convention regarding the necessity of the interference the government argued that in cases which required a balancing of the respective interests under articles and of the convention the domestic courts enjoyed a certain margin of appreciation in the present case the courts had exercised their discretion in accordance with the criteria established by the courts caselaw they had accepted that the article itself contributed to a public debate while considering that reproduction of the anonymous letter could not be justified by the duty of the press to impart information the courts had observed in particular that the anonymous letter had made farreaching allegations of dishonesty and other reprehensible character traits against cm and jm both in their professional lives as practising lawyers and in their private lives the anonymous letter thus contained excessive value judgments as it did not provide any factual basis for the accusations made the courts had also taken into account the fact that the alleged deficiencies in the work or character of cm and jm had not been the subject of any public discussion before publication of the article including the anonymous letter in the governments view the domestic courts had rightly considered that section of the media act did not apply as the impugned statement could not be attributed to a third person but was anonymous and moreover there had been no overriding public interest in its publication lastly the courts had had regard to the fact that the article had brought the contents of the anonymous letter to the attention of a far larger public since the letter itself had originally only been addressed to some recipients the courts assessment it is not in dispute that the courts judgments constituted an interference with the applicant companys right to freedom of expression which was based on section of the media act taken in conjunction with article of the criminal code and served a legitimate aim namely the protection of the reputation and rights of others the parties argument concentrated on the question whether this interference was necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention in respect of the general principles developed by its caselaw under article relating to the freedom of the press the court refers to its assessment in a number of recent cases see mgn limited v the united kingdom no january von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr and axel springer ag v germany gc no february in these judgments the court also set out the relevant principles to be applied when examining the necessity of an instance of interference with the right to freedom of expression in the interests of the protection of the reputation or rights of others it noted that in such cases the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases namely freedom of expression protected by article and the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see mgn limited cited above von hannover no cited above and axel springer ag cited above in the context of the present case the court reiterates that the right to protection of reputation is a right protected by article of the convention as part of the right to respect for private life see axel springer ag cited above and polanco torres and movilla polanco v spain no september in von hannover no cited above and axel springer ag cited above the court defined the contracting states margin of appreciation and its own role in balancing these two conflicting interests it held in particular that where the balancing exercise between the rights under articles and of the convention has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see also mgn limited cited above the court went on to identify a number of criteria as being relevant where the right of freedom of expression is being balanced against the right to respect for private life see von hannover no cited above and axel springer ag cited above namelya contribution to a debate of general interestb how well known is the person concerned and what is the subject of the reportc prior conduct of the person concernedd method of obtaining the information and its veracitye content form and consequences of the publicationf severity of the sanction imposed in the present case the court will therefore examine whether the domestic courts carried out the balancing exercise in conformity with the criteria laid down in its caselawa contribution to a debate of general interest the domestic courts accepted that the article itself contributed to a debate of general interest namely the upcoming election of the chairman of the local tourism association and the campaign against cm who held the post of chairman at the time and was standing again as a candidate and his brother jm a local politicianb how well known is the person concerned and what is the subject of the report the domestic courts also took into account that cm and jm were well known to the local public and had been in the local media on account of their respective functions as chairman of the tourism association for hall and wattens and member of the hall city council furthermore they noted that the article had reported on the anonymous letter directed against cm and jm in an objective mannerc prior conduct of the person concerned regarding the prior conduct of the people concerned the courts noted that prior to the dissemination of the anonymous letter there had been no public discussion of cm and jms professional or private conduct in other words there had not been any allegations of misconduct against them the court observes that there is no indication that cm and jm although often in the local media sought the limelight or laid open any details regarding their professional lives as practising lawyers or their private livesd method of obtaining the information and its veracity the court notes that while the case file does not contain any information on how the journalist l managed to obtain a copy of the anonymous letter it shows that he duly gave cm and jm an opportunity to comment before its publication but proceeded to publish the letter anyway against cms explicit wishes regarding the veracity of the information the applicant company did not claim that the allegations made in the anonymous letter against cm and jm were true or had any factual basis it merely relied on the argument that printing the letter was no more than a quotation of someone elses statements however the domestic courts argued that the publication of an anonymous letter had to be distinguished from the quotation of a third persons statement and that in any case the question whether there was an overriding public interest in publication of the anonymous letter had to be examined the court considers that this approach is not at variance with its caselaw it has repeatedly held that punishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so see jersild v denmark september series a no thoma v luxembourg no echr iii and verlagsgruppe news gmb h v austria no december most of the cases concerned statements made by third persons whose identities were known however it is important to note that the courts own examination of whether there had been a violation of article of the convention involved an assessment of the news item or newspaper article as a whole in accordance with the criteria developed by its caselaw among other criteria the court looked into the question whether the reporting was balanced and had regard to the context in which the offensive quotations had been made see for instance jersild cited above the case cited by the applicant company which related to the publication of a letter to the editor whose author could not be identified indicates that journalists or editors may also quote anonymous statements albert engelmann gesellschaft mb h cited above however the case also demonstrates that the final assessment of whether there has been a violation of article depends on a balancing of all relevant criteria the court did not share the domestic courts view that the fact that the letter to the editor had been an anonymous one was of relevance its finding of a violation of article in that case was mainly based on the consideration that the offending statements contained in the anonymous letter were value judgments which had a sufficient factual basis in statements which the claimant himself had previously made ibid in the present case as has already been noted above there had been no allegations against cm and jm before the publication of the anonymous letter and there is no indication that their own conduct provided any factual basis for the value judgments contained in the anonymous letter which were thus no more than a gratuitous attack on their reputation in these circumstances the court accepts that there were strong reasons for considering that the publication of the anonymous letter transgressed the limits of permissible reportinge content form and consequences of the publication in respect of the content form and consequences of the publication the domestic courts had regard to the fact that the impugned article in the bezirksblatt had not only reported on the anonymous letter in the context of the upcoming elections of the chairman of the local tourism association but had reproduced the anonymous letter and thus had disseminated it to a far larger public than the restricted circle of initial recipients see paragraphs and above they also referred to the negative repercussions cm and jm had experienced in their professional lives as practising lawyersf severity of the sanction imposed the court notes that the sanction imposed namely the order to pay compensation of eur to each of the claimants and to publish the regional courts judgment is not of a degree of severity which would render the interference disproportionateg overall conclusion the foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the court to conclude that the domestic courts duly applied the criteria established by the courts caselaw when ordering the applicant company to pay compensation to cm and jm under article of the media act they gave relevant and sufficient reasons for arriving at the conclusion that while the publication of the article itself contributed to a debate of general interest reproduction of the anonymous letter amounted to defamation the court does not see any strong reasons to substitute its own view for that of the contested decisions of the domestic courts there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on october pursuant to rule and of the rules of court andré wampach isabelle berro lefèvre deputy registrar president,,,

may and april the applicant passed information about the prison to a tabloid journalist on around forty occasions in exchange for money totalling pounds sterling gbp the information supplied formed the basis of numerous published articles in the daily mirror and news of the world newspapers the stories for which his information was the source ranged from general stories in which individuals were not identified to specific or personal stories in which prisoners or staff were named or identifiable in july as a result of revelations widespread public concern arose about the conduct of some journalists working for certain newspapers in the united kingdom in particular the means by which they obtained stories these included unlawful telephone hacking and corruption of public officials the revelations led to proceedings before two parliamentary select committees and the institution of a public inquiry the leveson inquiry which considered the culture practices and ethics of the press meanwhile the police launched a criminal investigation into allegations of inappropriate payments by some journalists to public officials operation elveden in july the police requested from the owner of the daily mirror mirror group newspapers mgn details of public officials who had been paid for information a memorandum of understanding mo u was agreed between the police and mgn to provide a framework for the voluntary provision by mgn of material relevant to operation elveden under clause of the mo u mgn was entitled to withhold or provide a redacted or edited version of any relevant documentation to the extent that it amounted to excluded material excluded material included journalistic material held in confidence which in mgns judgment it would not be in the public interest to disclose having regard to crown prosecution service cps guidance the code for crown prosecutors the code of practice of the press complaints commission and in particular to the public interest served by the freedom of expression balanced against the extent of any apparent wrongdoing and harm in early mgn undertook a search of its records in order to identify and in line with the mo u disclose information sought by the police the disclosure process was overseen by counsel instructed by mgn the applicant was identified as a recipient of payments and mgn subsequently disclosed his name to the police the criminal proceedingsthe applicants arrest in june the applicant was arrested and charged with misconduct in public office on the ground that he had passed information obtained in the course of his duties to the media in return for payment misconduct in public office is a commonlaw offence which is made out where a public officer acting as such wilfully neglects to perform his duty andor wilfully misconducts himself to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the publics trust in the office holder without reasonable excuse or justification see paragraphs below in march the court of appeal handed down judgment in a case concerning a prison officer who had been convicted of misconduct in public office for having passed information to the media r v chapman and others see paragraphs below in its judgment the court considered what was required to satisfy the third element of the offence namely conduct to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the publics trust the seriousness test in the light of the judgment the cps conducted a review of relevant pending cases it decided that it remained in the public interest to proceed with the charges against the applicant the trial the applicants trial before a jury began in may he did not dispute that he had provided the information to the journalist and had received payment for it his defence was that his actions were justified and that his conduct was insufficiently serious to satisfy the seriousness test application to stay the indictment at the outset of the trial the applicant made an application to the judge to stay the indictment for abuse of process on the basis that his prosecution breached article of the convention he argued that the disclosure of his name had not been voluntary since at the relevant time mgn had been a suspect in a corporate prosecution investigation he further argued that the mo u should have included safeguards for journalistic sources to prevent disclosure of his name including independent scrutiny of the decision to disclose and the opportunity to make representations during the disclosure process he pointed out that the mo u made no mention of article of the convention referring to caselaw of this court he submitted that the police had taken receipt of the material without a lawful article compliant process the prosecution contested the application they argued that the rights accorded by article were not absolute and were subject to limitation to protect the reputation or rights of others and to prevent the disclosure of information received in confidence the provision of information on the applicants identity had been justified under article as it had disclosed prima facie evidence against him in relation to his longstanding and repeated disclosure of confidential information to a journalist in flagrant breach of his terms of employment although the mo u did not specifically refer to article it had its essence in mind given the terms in which it was drafted and the manner in which it was reasonable to assume that it had been given effect journalistic privilege did not preclude newspapers from voluntarily disclosing the identity of a source on may the judge refused the application he acknowledged that there was a reasonable inference that mgn had assisted the police with its investigation in the hope that its actions would avoid prosecutions at a higher level however he concluded that the applicant had failed to establish any breach of article he accepted the prosecution submission that the mo u had been drafted with the essence of article in mind and that disclosure had been justified under article he further noted that journalistic privilege did not preclude a newspaper from voluntarily disclosing the identity of a source submission of no case to answer at the close of the prosecution case the applicant sought a ruling from the judge that there was no case to answer on the basis that the four essential elements of the offence had not been made out see paragraph below on may the judge refused the application he found that in respect of each element of the offence there was evidence on which it would be open to a jury to be sure that this element was made out he considered that the fact that the applicant had chosen to have cheques for the first twentyseven transactions made out to his son who transferred the equivalent amount into the applicants bank account was capable of giving rise to the inference that the applicant knew very well that what he was doing was wrong and in breach of duty as to whether the applicant had a reasonable excuse or justification for his action the judge found it open to the jury to conclude that he did not having regard to the number of stories involved the length of time over which information was divulged the amount of money involved and the fact that the applicant had not taken up any matters which featured in the stories through official channels despite his claims to have been concerned for reasons of public interest in respect of the seriousness test the judge took the view that a jury could conclude that the necessary harm to the public interest had been established by the very fact of a prison officer having been in a longstanding relationship with a journalist and in breach of his duty repeatedly divulging information about the prison for money conviction and sentence on june the applicant was convicted by the jury the following day he was sentenced to twenty months imprisonment in his sentencing remarks the judge accepted that the applicant had had genuine concerns about the manner in which the prison was being run this he considered had been in part a motivating factor for his actions the judge continued that said in my judgment that does not tell the whole story on a number of occasions as you yourself conceded in evidence you disclosed information when the public interest had nothing at all to do with what you were imparting the judge considered that the applicant had been motivated by money and by an intense dislike of the prison governor he further pointed out that the applicant had been a tradeunion representative and could have used official channels to disseminate information had public interest been his sole concern as to the harm caused by his actions the judge referred to the suspicion that had fallen on other innocent members of staff since the identity of the person leaking stories was unknown he also highlighted the damage to prisoners who had been demonised in the tabloid stories as well as the resulting potential for enmity from other inmates and inmates general mistrust of prison staff because of the leaks finally the fact that for a lengthy period of time and on numerous occasions the applicant had acted in flagrant breach of rules which the judge was satisfied he knew very well prohibited such contacts with the press represented a very serious breach of trust in sentencing him to a term of imprisonment the judge emphasised the scope and scale of the offending in the case the court of appeal the applicant sought leave to appeal against conviction and sentence his application for leave to appeal against sentence was refused on september on september he was granted leave to appeal his conviction in his written argument prior to the appeal hearing he advanced two grounds of appeal first he argued that the trial judge had erred in failing to stay the prosecution as an abuse of process see paragraphs above disclosure of his name as a journalistic source had breached article because mgn had been acting under pressure and because the disclosure process had not been prescribed by law as it had lacked the necessary safeguards second he argued that the judge should have acceded to his submission of no case to answer see paragraphs above he contended that his misconduct did not meet the criminal threshold but amounted rather to a disciplinary offence and the appropriate article compliant sanction would therefore have been disciplinary proceedings not a criminal prosecution he added that the criminal prosecution of a disciplinary offence offended the principle of legal certainty and thus violated article of the convention on october the court of appeal dismissed the appeal in its judgment it listed the stories for which the applicants information was said to have been the source which it noted ranged from general stories in which individuals generally remained anonymous to specific or personal stories in which prisoners or staff were named or identifiable the court noted at the outset that all of the caselaw of the european court of human rights cited in argument was concerned with the compulsory disclosure of journalistic sources or materials it found no evidential basis for the applicants suggestion that the police had exerted any improper pressure on mgn to disclose information in particular the comments of the trial judge regarding the newspapers hope that their assistance would avoid prosecution at a higher level see paragraph above merely recorded the motivation of the newspapers it did not amount to a finding that the police had sought to impose any pressure on them indeed the court said all the evidence suggested the reverse it explained the police made no threat or promise express or implied about the bringing of a prosecution against the company or companies or their top management the police were seeking voluntary disclosure under the terms of the mo u clause of which made clear that mgn retained the right to invoke article grounds for refusing disclosure mgn was a large organisation with access to inhouse and external legal advice it was inconceivable that mgn did not give careful consideration to whether to make disclosure to the police in the context of the publicity which operation elveden and the leveson inquiry were attracting the police were entitled to assume that the disclosure which was proffered was as a result of a considered and informed decision with the benefit of full and accurate legal advice the court concluded that the disclosure had not been procured by any improper pressure or coercion but had been truly voluntary there had therefore been no misconduct by the police in receiving or acting upon the information the court further rejected the argument that voluntary disclosure was a breach of the applicants article right as a journalistic source to have his anonymity maintained it considered that there was room for doubt whether the applicants article rights were engaged at all in these circumstances referring to council of europe recommendations see paragraphs below it noted that while the right of journalists to withhold journalistic material was an important article right there was no concomitant obligation on journalists to do so the court also noted that the edition of the editors code of practice described a journalists obligation to protect confidential sources of information as a moral obligation see paragraph below in the event the court did not find it necessary to decide the point since even if such a right existed it was not unqualified assuming in the applicants favour that article was engaged the court was satisfied that the use of the material in his prosecution in the circumstances of his case was compatible with article the freedom of expression which potentially fell within article was the provision of information in return for the corrupt acceptance of money by him as a public official over a prolonged period which amounted to the serious criminal offence of misconduct in public office revelation of the applicants wrongdoing was necessary and proportionate for the important public interest of prosecuting a crime which existed in this context to maintain the integrity and efficacy of the prison service and the publics confidence in it the court then turned to examine the second ground of appeal that the trial judge should have acceded to his nocasetoanswer submission it observed that while the challenge before the trial court had been that the prosecution case had been insufficient to be left to the jury in respect of all four elements of the offence see paragraph above on appeal the argument had been confined to the second and third elements see paragraph below only as to the seriousness test the third element the court agreed with the findings of the trial judge see paragraph above it considered that the prosecution evidence was capable of meeting the high threshold of criminality because of the harm to the public interest caused by the applicants conduct in this respect the court referred to the extent of the applicants corrupt activity taking payments of over gbp for a period of some five years was conduct that the jury had been entitled to conclude was not justified in the public interest it was also conduct that caused significant public harm because corruption of a prison officer on this scale undermined public confidence in the prison service the court further referred to the impact of the leaks from an unknown source on trust and morale among and between prisoners and staff and the deterrent effect on staff and prisoners reporting incidents as regards the second element of the test the applicants argument was that what he had done had been in accordance with the freedom of expression protected by article and it could not therefore amount to a breach of duty the court disposed of this argument on the basis that the applicants conduct amounting to the serious offence of misconduct in public office was not protected by article lastly the court dealt briefly with the article point see paragraph in fine above which it noted had not been pursued in oral argument it concluded that there was no lack of certainty in the seriousness element of the offence of misconduct in public office it had recently been clearly articulated and explained in attorney generals reference no of and r v chapman and others see paragraphs below in the latter case it had been made clear that the level of seriousness which had to be reached was defined by recognised criteria on which the jury were to be directed the seriousness test was therefore sufficiently clear to enable a person with appropriate legal advice if necessary to regulate his behaviour and foresee whether such behaviour was capable of amounting to misconduct in public office the supreme court the applicant applied for leave to appeal to the supreme court relying on articles and of the convention on january the court of appeal refused to certify a point of law of general public importance and refused leave to appeal relevant legal framework and practicedomestic law and practicemisconduct in public office the elements of the offence misconduct in public office is a commonlaw offence not defined in statute it carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment the leading modern case defining the offence is attorney generals reference no of ewca crim in which the court of appeal at paragraph stated that the elements of the offence were a public officer acting as such wilfully neglects to perform his duty andor wilfully misconducts himself to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the publics trust in the office holder without reasonable excuse or justification as regards the seriousness test the court explained the threshold is a high one requiring conduct so far below acceptable standards as to amount to an abuse of the publics trust in the office holder a mistake even a serious one will not suffice the motive with which a public officer acts may be relevant to the decision whether the publics trust is abused by the conduct the element of culpability must be of such a degree that the misconduct impugned is calculated to injure the public interest so as to call for condemnation and punishment it will normally be necessary to consider the likely consequences of the breach in deciding whether the conduct falls so far below the standard of conduct to be expected of the officer as to constitute the offence the conduct can not be considered in a vacuum the consequences likely to follow from it will often influence the decision as to whether the conduct amounted to an abuse of the publics trust in the officer a default where the consequences are likely to be trivial may not possess the criminal quality required a similar default where the damage to the public or members of the public is likely to be great may do so the consequences of some conduct such as corrupt conduct may be obvious the likely consequences of other conduct of public officers will be less clear but it is impossible to gauge the seriousness of the defaulting conduct without considering the circumstances in which the conduct occurs and its likely consequences in the light of operation elveden and the resulting criminal investigations the director of public prosecutions issued cps guidelines for prosecutors on assessing the public interest in cases affecting the media on september the guidance specifically referred to article of the convention and emphasised that prosecutors were required to take the right to freedom of expression including the right to receive and impart information into account when taking decisions on whether to prosecute in march the court of appeal considered the ambit of the offence in the case of r v chapman and others ewca crim where one of the issues before the court was whether the trial judges direction concerning the threshold of seriousness had been correct the court referred to attorney generals reference no of see paragraph above and noted that it had not been suggested that this formulation of the law was in any way inaccurate it considered that there were two ways in which the jury might be assisted to assess seriousness the first was to refer them to the need for them to reach a judgment that the misconduct was worthy of condemnation and punishment the second was to refer them to the requirement that the misconduct had to be judged by them as having had the effect of harming the public interest on the latter the court went on to explain in our view in the context of provision of information to the media and thus the public that is the way in which the jury should judge the seriousness of the misconduct in determining whether it amounts to an abuse of the publics trust in the office holder the jury must in our view judge the misconduct by considering objectively whether the provision of the information by the office holder in deliberate breach of his duty had the effect of harming the public interest if it did not then although there may have been a breach or indeed an abuse of trust by the office holder visàvis his employers or commanding officer there was no abuse of the publics trust in the office holder as the misconduct had not had the effect of harming the public interest no criminal offence would have been committed in the context of a case involving the media and the ability to report information provided in breach of duty and in breach of trust by a public officer the harm to the public interest is in our view the major determinant in establishing whether the conduct can amount to an abuse of the publics trust and thus a criminal offence for example the public interest can be sufficiently harmed if either the information disclosed itself damages the public interest as may be the case in a leak of budget information or the manner in which the information is provided or obtained damages the public interest as may be the case if the public office holder is paid to provide the information in breach of duty the law commission project the law commission was set up for the purpose of promoting the reform of the law in it began a project on the offence of misconduct in public office its reform objectives were to decide whether the offence of misconduct in public office should be abolished retained restated or amended it published an issues paper on january launching the first phase of the consultation process appendix c to the paper is entitled misconduct in public office and the echr it identified the definition of the seriousness test as being one of the main difficulties from the perspective of article of the convention the paper continued c this question was the main focus of the recent court of appeal decision in chapman here the seriousness test was compared to the test in gross negligence manslaughter which also has difficulties in terms of circularity and uncertainty the court felt that it is not helpful for a jury to be told that the breach of duty must be so serious as to amount to a criminal act and sought to solve this difficulty by applying another method of determining whether the conduct was so serious it held that the jury must be referred to the requirement that the misconduct must be judged by them as having the effect of harming the public interest unfortunately the concept of public interest is not one with consensus as to its meaning and therefore may not be a much clearer basis for the test the law commission concluded in so far as relevant that the seriousness test was illdefined and vague and that since it was a core element of the offence the law might be incompatible with article of the convention paragraph c in the second phase of the consultation process the law commission published consultation paper no of september reforming misconduct in public office and invited responses it explained that in the light of the responses received it intended to decide on its final recommendations and present them to government at paragraph of the paper the law commission noted that numerous problems had been identified including an abuse of the publics trust is crucial in acting as a threshold element of the offence but is so vague that it is difficult for investigators prosecutors and juries to apply the paper continued paragraph the lord chief justice lord thomas reiterated recently in the case of chapman that the legal position is that an abuse of the publics trust is one that has the effect of harming the public interest however it remains unclear what role if any factors such as consequences and impropriety of motive will play in the assessment of harm to the public interest we consider that the difficulties currently experienced with the definition of seriousness in the offence are unlikely to be resolved by the courts without a more fundamental review of this element of the offence there are two problems with this element first the jury is being asked to make a circular assessment of whether an individuals breach of duty is serious enough to be criminal it is criminal because it is serious it is serious because it is criminal secondly this may be compounded by the fact the jury is being asked to do so without any clear indication of what could amount to serious and therefore criminal misconduct the lack of comprehensive guidance as to what makes misconduct serious causes difficulties for investigators prosecutors judges and juries it is particularly difficult in terms of making decisions as to where the line should be drawn between disciplinary and criminal proceedings the law commissions final report and recommendations were published on december in its report it repeated its concerns as to the difficulties a jury may have in applying the seriousness criterion overall as regards the commonlaw offence it concluded in summary we consider the following to be the main concerns it is not clear in all cases whether a person might be subject to the offence as the category of public office is not defined with sufficient precision this creates problems in practice including erroneous charging decisions and successful appeals and may offend article of the european convention on human rights the fault element that must be proved appears to vary depending on the circumstances of the case creating additional complexity and leading to costly appeals the seriousness threshold that the offence amounts to an abuse of the publics trust is highly subjective and difficult to apply this has led to concern that the offence is being pursued in some circumstances that are not sufficiently blameworthy so as to justify criminal consequences there is a general lack of definition in the scope and subject matter of the offence which has led to its application in contentious contexts the law commission accordingly recommended the abolition of the commonlaw offence and its replacement with two statutory offences corruption in public office and breach of duty in public office duties related to employment in the prison service rule of the prison rules provides no officer shall make directly or indirectly any unauthorised communication to a representative of the press or any other person concerning matters which have become known to him in the course of his duty article of the civil service code provides civil servants must not misuse their official position or information acquired in the course of their official duties to further their private interest or those of others they should not receive benefits of any kind from a third party which might reasonably be seen to compromise their personal judgment or integrity protection of journalistic sources clause of the editors code of practice of the independent press standards organisation is entitled confidential sources and provides journalists have a moral obligation to protect confidential sources of information international law and practicecouncil of europe recommendation no r recommendation no r on the right of journalists not to disclose their sources of information was adopted by the committee of ministers of the council of europe on march it sets out in an appendix principles concerning the right of journalists not to disclose their sources of information principle provides that domestic law should provide for explicit and clear protection of the right of journalists not to disclose information identifying a source in accordance with article of the convention pursuant to principle the right of journalists not to disclose information identifying a source must not be subject to other restrictions than those mentioned in article of the convention according to principle journalists should be informed by the competent authorities of their right not to disclose information identifying a source as well as the limits of this right before a disclosure is requested council of europe recommendation recommendation of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on the protection of journalists sources was adopted on january paragraph provides public authorities must not demand the disclosure of information identifying a source unless the requirements of article paragraph of the convention are met and unless it can be convincingly established that reasonable alternative measures to disclosure do not exist or have been exhausted the legitimate interest in the disclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in the nondisclosure and an overriding requirement of the need for disclosure is proved at paragraph the assembly welcomes the fact that journalists have expressed in professional codes of conduct their obligation not to disclose their sources of information when they receive information confidentially it explains that this professional ethical standard ensures that sources may rely on confidentiality and decide to provide journalists with information which may be of public concern it invites journalists and their organisations to ensure through selfregulation that sources are not disclosed the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the offence of misconduct in public office was too vague for him to have foreseen that as a result of his actions he would be subject to criminal prosecution he relied on article of the convention which reads as follows no one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed admissibility the court is of the opinion that the complaint raises sufficiently complex issues of fact and law so that it can not be rejected as manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible merits the parties submissionsa the applicant the applicant submitted that at the material time it had not been possible for him to foresee that by breaching the general rules of his employment he would be subject to criminal trial and imprisonment it was only after he had voluntarily ceased his activities that prosecutions were initiated against public servants and journalists for the offence of misconduct in public office if information had been provided and money paid he contended that it was not until the court of appeal judgment in r v chapman and others see paragraphs above that it became clear that payment for information alone could constitute criminal conduct this development he said had not been predictable and postdated his own conduct the applicant referred to the view of the law commission that the offence was ill defined see paragraphs above and submitted that the piecemeal development of the law made it difficult for citizens to predict even after relying on legal advice or to regulate their conductb the government the government pointed out that article did not require criminal offences to have a statutory footing the courts caselaw had recognised the compatibility with article of changes to criminal offences including commonlaw offences as a result of legal developments the elements of the offence at issue in the present case had been clarified in attorney generals reference no of with equivalent precision to statutory offences well before the applicant had begun to commit it see paragraphs above in particular the government endorsed the conclusion of the court of appeal that the seriousness test was sufficiently clear to enable a person with appropriate legal advice to regulate his behaviour and foresee whether it was capable of amounting to misconduct in public office concerning the law commissions project see paragraphs above the government submitted that none of the issues highlighted in the issues paper arose in the applicants case the conduct for which the applicant had been convicted had always fallen within the range of conduct to which the offence undoubtedly applied the applicants disclosures to the journalist were as he might have foreseen and any competent lawyer would have advised him misconduct in public office on any view the courts assessmenta general principles article should be construed and applied in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution conviction and punishment among its guarantees it lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accuseds detriment it follows that offences must be clearly defined by law when speaking of law article implies qualitative requirements notably those of accessibility and foreseeability this requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision if need be with the assistance of the courts interpretation of it and after taking appropriate legal advice what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable see del río prada v spain gc no and echr and dallas v the united kingdom no february with further references the progressive development of criminal law through judicial lawmaking is a wellentrenched and necessary part of legal tradition in the contracting states article of the convention can not be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen see del río prada cited above and dallas cited above with further references it is primarily for the national authorities notably the courts to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation it is not the task of this court to substitute itself for the domestic courts as regards the assessment of the facts and their legal classification provided that these are based on a reasonable assessment of the evidence the courts role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the convention see dallas cited above b application of the general principles to the facts of the case the court emphasises at the outset that the commonlaw nature of the offence of misconduct in public office does not in itself give rise to any particular concerns under article the courts caselaw makes clear that article does not require a criminal offence to be placed on a statutory footing see for example dallas cited above and sw v the united kingdom november series a no b where the court found no violation in cases concerning commonlaw offences what is important is that whatever the basis for the offence the substantive guarantees of legal certainty are satisfied the parties do not dispute the four elements of the offence of misconduct in public office or that these four elements were clearly articulated by the court of appeal in attorney generals reference no of see paragraph above well before the applicant began to provide information to the journalist in exchange for money the applicant contends however that the content of the offence was too vague to satisfy the requirements of article he refers to the work of the law commission see paragraphs above in this respect the applicant did not dispute before the court of appeal that the first and fourth elements of the test for misconduct in public office see paragraph above had been made out see paragraph above he did not contest that disclosing internal prison information to the press breached his employment duties as set out in the prison rules see paragraph above but argued that his conduct was protected by article his challenge to the clarity of the offence essentially concerned the third element namely the seriousness test see paragraph above thus the courts startingpoint is the explanation of the seriousness test given in attorney generals reference no of itself see paragraph above there the court of appeal pointed to the role played by the motive with which a public officer acted the circumstances in which the impugned conduct occurred and the consequences of the breach in establishing whether the requisite seriousness threshold had been attained the fact that the applicant was paid to disclose the sensitive information in question indisputably pertains to his motive for acting and also forms part of the circumstances in which the conduct occurred it therefore ought to have been plain to him before embarking on his course of conduct in that his accepting payment in exchange for stories was likely to be a factor which would be taken into account by the court in assessing whether the criminal offence of misconduct in public office had been committed in fact in deciding whether there was a case to answer the trial judge considered that the fact that the applicant had chosen to have a number of cheques made out to his son was capable of giving rise to the inference that the applicant knew very well that what he was doing was wrong and in breach of duty see paragraph above the court agrees and considers in particular that the attempt to conceal the payments demonstrates that the applicant was well aware of the potential role that the payment of money might play in any subsequent investigation of wrongdoing the applicant has argued that the importance of payment to the establishment of the offence was not fully evident until the court of appeals judgment in r v chapman and others see paragraph above the court observes however that payment was only one of the elements taken into consideration by the domestic authorities in establishing the requisite seriousness threshold for the offence it further reiterates that article does not preclude the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation see the caselaw quoted in paragraph above in the applicants case it is satisfied that any development of the law in r v chapman and others was consistent with the essence of the offence and could have been reasonably foreseen it must also have been apparent to the applicant from attorney generals reference no of that the consequences of his actions would be taken into account when establishing whether the seriousness test had been met the sentencing judge pointed to the suspicion that had fallen on innocent members of staff as a result of the leaks by an unknown source the damage to prisoners demonised in the press and the general enmity and mistrust that the leaks caused both within the prison population and between prisoners and staff see paragraph above the court of appeal agreed with these findings adding that corruption of a prison officer on the scale present in the applicants case undermined public confidence in the prison service see paragraph above these consequences were considered to be serious none of the conclusions by the domestic courts can be said to have been unforeseeable or surprising lastly the description of the seriousness test itself in attorney generals reference no of tends to suggest that the scope and scale of the behaviour in question could be a relevant factor when assessing seriousness in the present case as the trial judge and the court of appeal pointed out see paragraphs and above the applicant disclosed information to a newspaper in exchange for payment on forty occasions over a period of five years in flagrant breach of rules of which he was well aware in particular in his sentencing remarks the judge emphasised the very serious breach of trust which had occurred in the case when imposing a custodial sentence of twenty months imprisonment the applicant has argued that his behaviour ought to have been sanctioned only in disciplinary proceedings rather than by way of a criminal prosecution the court observes that conduct does not fall outside the scope of the criminal law merely because it also constitutes a disciplinary offence as noted above the applicant placed some reliance on the law commissions work see paragraphs above the court observes that the law commissions final report identifies a concern as to legal certainty from the perspective of article but this is limited to the definition of public office the applicant did not contest that this criterion was evidently satisfied in his case see paragraphs and above in any event the report recognises that the classification of public office is clear for civil servants a category which included the applicant while the report also notes that the nature of the seriousness threshold has led to concern that the offence is being prosecuted in circumstances not sufficiently blameworthy as to justify criminal consequences this is clearly not the case here as explained in the preceding paragraphs the domestic courts in the applicants case pointed to the serious nature of his offending the court does not exclude that there may be cases in which given their specific facts prosecution and conviction for misconduct in public office were arguably not foreseeable however for the reasons outlined above it does not consider the applicants prosecution and conviction to be such a case in conclusion the court is satisfied that the applicant ought to have been aware if necessary after having sought legal advice that by providing internal prison information to a journalist in exchange for money on numerous occasions over a fiveyear period he risked being found guilty of the offence of misconduct in public office there has therefore been no violation of article of the convention alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the disclosure of his identity by mgn to the police and his subsequent prosecution and conviction violated his right to protection as a journalistic source under article of the convention which provides everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the court considers it appropriate to examine each of these two complaints separately the disclosure of the applicants identity admissibilityc the parties submissions the government submitted that article did not apply to the mere provision by mgn and receipt by the police of voluntary information they underlined that the disclosure had been voluntary there had been no compulsion involved they argued that it would be inimical to the rights and freedoms of a democratic society were a journalist unable to disclose criminal wrongdoing to the police or the police unable to rely on voluntary disclosures made by journalists moreover in their view there was no freestanding right of anonymity for a source under the convention the protection afforded by article in this respect was accorded only to the journalist accordingly the government submitted the disclosure of the applicants name to the police did not engage article the applicant argued that the right of a source not to be identified by a journalist was a necessary corollary of the right of the journalist not to disclose the source and therefore an inseparable element of the protection afforded by article by asking for and receiving information about his identity the police had acted incompatibly with his article rights moreover the disclosure by mgn had not been truly voluntary since the company had acted under pressure to avoid a corporate prosecution he argued that the disclosure of his name without any prior review of the proposed disclosure by an independent body amounted to an interference with his right to speak out but remain anonymousd the courts assessment in the absence of a court order compelling disclosure of the applicants identity the court must examine whether the complaint is compatible ratione personae with the provisions of the convention within the meaning of article a of the convention the applicants position was that the disclosure by mgn was not voluntary but resulted from improper pressure from the police and was therefore akin to the compelled disclosure by the state of his name as a journalistic source the court can not accept this argument as the court of appeal pointed out the reference by the trial judge to the motivation of mgn in assisting the police can not be equated to a finding that pressure was put on mgn to disclose the applicants name see paragraph above even though the mo u did not expressly refer to article its terms allowed mgn to refuse to disclose information on article grounds including the right to protect journalistic sources see paragraphs and above mgn enjoyed access to legal advice and as the court of appeal found it is inconceivable that they did not give careful consideration to whether to make disclosure to the police in the context of the publicity which operation elveden and the leveson inquiry were attracting in these circumstances the court accepts the finding of the court of appeal that the disclosure was truly voluntary see paragraph above in the absence of any compulsion on mgn to disclose the applicants name the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the disclosure was attributable to the respondent state in particular it can not be said that merely by requesting the information agreeing an mo u or accepting receipt of the information the police interfered with the applicants article rights the applicants complaint concerning the disclosure of his information is accordingly incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the convention and must be declared inadmissible pursuant to article a the prosecution and conviction of the applicant admissibility in imparting information to the journalist in this case the applicant could assert his right to freedom of expression his prosecution and conviction for disclosing the information amounted to an interference with his article rights the court is therefore of the opinion that the complaint raises sufficiently complex issues of fact and law so that it can not be rejected as manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention and is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible meritse the parties submissionsi the applicant the applicant argued that the decisions to prosecute him and to refuse his applications for abuse of process and no case to answer violated his article rights given the circumstances of the disclosure of his name to the police he contended that the offence was vague and his prosecution on the basis of his actions had not been foreseeable at the time he carried them out he also argued that there had been a clear public interest in the information he had provided and that disclosure of the information had not been harmful he claimed that he had taken steps to raise his public interest concerns at the prison on numerous occasions but that no action had been taken causing him to finally resort to providing information to a journalist to highlight these important issues he disputed that the information had been received by him in confidence or that its disclosure had been harmful he underlined the chilling effect that the prosecution and conviction had had on freedom of expression his treatment would leave sources concerned that without more their identities could be disclosed to the police by journalists and discourage them from contacting the mediaii the government the government submitted that any interference because of the applicants prosecution or his conviction had been justified under article the criminal offence of misconduct in public office was accessible and foreseeable and thus prescribed by law for the reasons advanced in respect of the article complaint see paragraphs above any interference was also necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others and for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence the government pointed out that the applicant had committed a serious offence and that the information he had provided had been principally received in confidence consisting to a large extent of private information about prisoners and staff obtained in the course of his duties its disclosure had had a harmful impact on staff and prisoners and a negative effect on safety security and order within the prison it had also been in flagrant breach of duty the public interest in free speech had been carefully considered at each stage of the process the mo u had allowed mgn to withhold the information on public interests grounds the decision to prosecute had been reviewed by the cps in the light of emerging clarifications from the court of appeal as to the public interest defence available and public interest was a defence to the charge itself which would have resulted in the applicants acquittal had it been made out the applicant had been prosecuted and convicted precisely because his conduct did not fall within this defence the jurys verdict represented a finding of fact that the applicants conduct had not been in the public interestf the courts assessmenti general principles article expressly protects the freedom to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority the necessity of any restriction on freedom of expression must be convincingly established it is for the national authorities to assess in the first place whether there is a pressing social need for the restriction and in making their assessment they enjoy a certain margin of appreciation see goodwin v the united kingdom march reports of judgments and decisions ii the courts task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities but rather to review the case as a whole in the light of article and consider whether the decision taken by the national authorities fell within their margin of appreciation the court must therefore look at the interference and determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient ibid it is clear from the courts caselaw that freedom of expression is of particular relevance to the press whose duty it is to impart in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities information and ideas on all matters of public interest see bédat v switzerland gc no march accordingly the safeguards to be afforded to the press as part of its right to freedom of expression are of particular importance see sanoma uitgevers bv v the netherlands gc no september and goodwin cited above the court has explained that the most careful scrutiny under article is required where measures or sanctions imposed on the press are capable of discouraging the participation of the press in debates on matters of legitimate public concern see bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii and times newspapers ltd v the united kingdom nos and nos and echr accordingly a particularly narrow margin of appreciation will normally be accorded where the remarks concern a matter of public interest see bédat cited above furthermore the court has confirmed that under article the signalling by an employee in the public sector of illegal conduct or wrongdoing in the workplace should in certain circumstances enjoy protection this is particularly true where the employee concerned is the only person or part of a small category of people aware of what is happening at work and is thus best placed to act in the public interest by alerting the employer or the public at large see guja v moldova gc no echr and goryaynova v ukraine no october in such circumstances the court must enquire into whether there existed any alternative channels or other effective means for the applicant to remedy the alleged wrongdoing such as disclosure to the persons superior or other competent authority or body which the applicant intended to uncover see guja cited above ii application of the general principles to the facts of the case the court has no doubt that the prosecution and conviction of the applicant were prescribed by law within the meaning of article it has already found that the offence for which he was prosecuted was sufficiently clear and foreseeable in the circumstances of his case see paragraphs above the court further accepts that the prosecution and conviction of the applicant pursued the aims cited by the government namely the interests of public safety the prevention of disorder or crime the protection of health or morals the protection of the reputation or rights of others and the prevention of the disclosure of information received in confidence as to whether the applicants prosecution and conviction were necessary in a democratic society the court notes that the applicants conduct spanned a period of five years over the course of which he provided stories in exchange for payment on forty occasions this conduct was as the trial judge concluded in flagrant breach of the rules which applied to him as a prison officer and constituted a very serious breach of trust see paragraph above the applicant did not dispute before the court of appeal as the trial judge had found that he was aware of the rules and he accepted that his conduct had amounted to a disciplinary offence see paragraph above there can therefore be no doubt that the applicant knowingly engaged in a course of conduct contrary to the requirements of his public office and that the scope and scale of his unlawful conduct was significant the court also attaches significant weight in this context to the serious harm caused to other prisoners to staff and to public confidence in the prison service as a result of the applicants behaviour see paragraph above there was therefore a strong public interest in prosecuting him in order to maintain the integrity and efficacy of the prison service and the publics confidence in it on the other hand the domestic courts noted that there was no public interest in the majority of the information disclosed by the applicant nor had he been primarily motivated by publicinterest concerns in his sentencing remarks the judge recorded the applicants own concession in evidence that on a number of occasions he had disclosed information when the public interest had had nothing at all to do with what he was disclosing see paragraph above the judge found as fact that the applicant had been motivated by money and by an intense dislike of the prison governor see paragraph above the court of appeal having set out the articles for which the applicant had been the source and after careful consideration of the nature of those articles likewise noted that there was no public interest in the disclosures see paragraphs above since the applicant moreover did not claim before this court to have acted as a whistleblower as defined in the courts caselaw see paragraph above there is no need for the court to enquire into the kind of issue which has been central in the above caselaw on whistleblowing namely whether there existed any alternative channels or other effective means for the applicants to remedy the alleged wrongdoing which the applicants intended to uncover compare guja cited above the court would nonetheless observe in this respect that the sentencing judge pointed to the fact that as a tradeunion representative the applicant could have used official channels to disseminate information had public interest been his sole concern see paragraph above in conclusion the reasons for the applicants prosecution and conviction were relevant and sufficient and no violation of article is disclosed for these reasons the court unanimouslydeclares the complaint under article and the complaint under article in so far as it concerns the applicants prosecution and conviction admissible declares the remainder of the application inadmissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on july pursuant to rule and of the rules of court ilse freiwirth

61,the applicant was born in and lives in góis a background of the proceedings at the relevant time the applicant was a chief corporal in the national republican guard guarda nacional republicana working at the góis territorial post on november the applicant sent an email to the general inspectorate of internal administration inspecção geral da administração interna on the subject suspected misuse of money in which he made reference to an alleged misuse of money by commander mc of the arganil territorial post in accordance with what he had heard in a conversation with colleagues at the arganil territorial post he asked the general inspectorate to investigate the alleged facts stating as follows in the month of december the coimbra national republican guard territorial group distributed money to the territorial posts of its area of command for the christmas dinner the only members of the military in arganil who attended the dinner were the commander of the post and corporal m the total amount of money that had been given to the military from the territorial post to pay for the dinner was paid to the restaurants manager in exchange for a receipt it seems that the commander has since then been going with his family to the mentioned restaurant where the cost of his meals is deducted from the money that was not spent on the above dinner note i have just become aware of this matter through rumours within the military of the mentioned post who claim that they have not reported the situation for fear of reprisals and because of that fear of reprisals i ask you for secrecy during the investigation because i am also a member of the military on an unknown date the general inspectorate of internal administration forwarded the email to the general command of the national republican guard comando geral da guarda nacional republicana and to the lousã public prosecutors office ministério público on an unknown date the lousã public prosecutors office opened an investigation into the applicants allegations on february the lousã public prosecutors office discontinued the proceedings on the grounds that following investigations by the criminal investigation police policía judiciária it had found no evidence of the criminal offence denounced by the applicant the general inspectorate of internal administration also conducted an inquiry into the applicants allegations on june the inquiry was discontinued the general command of the national republican guard also started an internal inquiry into the allegations on december on december commander mc was heard in that respect he then became aware of the email of november and its content on february the inquiry was converted into disciplinary proceedings against commander mc at the request of the official in charge of the inquiry on the grounds that the management of the cafeteria of the arganil territorial post showed signs of lack of transparency which required further investigation on july the disciplinary proceedings against commander mc were discontinued on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to take disciplinary action the decision to discontinue the disciplinary proceedings also took into account the decision of the lousã public prosecutors office to discontinue the criminal proceedings against commander mcb criminal proceedings against the applicant on april commander mc lodged a criminal complaint before the lousã public prosecutors office accusing the applicant of defamation he alleged that the applicants email had disseminated injurious statements about him on july the public prosecutor brought charges acusação against the applicant for aggravated defamation on the grounds that the statements made in his email called into question commander mcs honesty honour and professional reputation which the applicant had intentionally attacked on september commander mc lodged a claim for damages against the applicant in the amount of euros eur in a judgment of january the lousã criminal court convicted the applicant of aggravated defamation and sentenced him to eighty dayfines totalling eur euros the applicant was also ordered to pay eur in damages to commander mc the court described its findings of fact and the manner in which it had assessed the evidence and held as follows since the existence of such a rumor has not been proved in any way the court is fully convinced that the defendants intention was to undermine the honour of the offended party once he knew that this was just a rumour and that therefore he was making an allegation that was not true the allegation made in the defendants complaint by its content put into question the offended partys honesty honour and professional reputation as commander of a territorial post of the national republican guard which was well known to the defendant the defendant has therefore acted in a free voluntary and conscious way with the achieved aim of attacking the offended partys honour and personal and professional reputation the disclosure of irregular situations has to be seen as a duty as the performance of an obligation when it falls within the competence and responsibilities of the whistleblower and when it does not go beyond the facts which were effectively observed whistleblowing can not be used as a basis to cast suspicion which can not be supported by any factual element in the instant case the defendant accuses the offended party of facts which are objectively dishonorable without having any evidence to substantiate them indeed by submitting that the offended party and his family were using the existing credit to have dinner at the mentioned restaurant the defendant knew that he was accusing the offended party of a dishonorable deed all the more because he knew that the offended party was in charge of the national republican guards arganil territorial post he further knew that the allegation was inconsistent with the truth and that he could easily have clarified its authenticity with the restaurant owner through such conduct the defendant acted of his own free will and in the knowledge that his actions were not allowed on an unknown date the applicant appealed against the judgment to the coimbra court of appeal in particular he contested the established facts as in his opinion he had not acted with the intention of attacking commander mcs honour and reputation on september the coimbra court of appeal upheld the firstinstance courts decision it considered that there were no reasons to change the facts established by the firstinstance court and as such no reasons to reach a different conclusion with regard to the applicants guilt and conviction c disciplinary proceedings against the applicant on august the general command of the national republican guard instituted disciplinary proceedings against the applicant on february the official in charge of the inquiry within the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant submitted a final report in which he concluded that the applicant had breached his duties the relevant passage of the report reads as follows the defendant breached the duty of loyalty as being on duty and being part of the góis territorial post in the quality of deputy commander of the post he did not inform his hierarchical superiors in clear disregard of the functional hierarchy principles of the acts allegedly committed in the report it was also taken into account that the applicants allegations had been investigated by different authorities all of which had discontinued their investigations additionally it had regard to the fact that the applicant had been convicted by the domestic courts in the criminal proceedings against him the report further analysed the existence of a fine which commander mc had imposed on the applicant before the latter had sent the impugned email however the official responsible for the report considered that fact to be innocuous and irrelevant on march at the request of the official responsible for the disciplinary proceedings the general command imposed on the applicant a disciplinary sanction consisting of suspension from duty for six days its enforcement being suspended for a period of twelve months according to the material submitted in the case file it seems that the applicant did not lodge an appeal against the disciplinary sanction with the minister of home affairs ii relevant domestic lawa relevant provisions of the portuguese criminal code article anyone who when addressing a third party accuses another even if the accusation takes the form of a suspicion or makes a judgment that casts a slur on the honour or reputation of the other even when reproducing the accusation or judgment shall be liable on conviction to a maximum of six months imprisonment or dayfines article provides that if the reporting agent has not complied with his duty to verify the information he has disclosed he will not be deemed to have acted in good faith article of the criminal code increases the sentence by half if the victim is an agent of authority b relevant provision of the statute of the military service of the national republican guard law decree no of november article other duties servicemen of the national republican guard also have the following dutiesi to refrain from making statements which could

faults or acts on the part of other servicemen which are against express legal provisions c in submitting a petition request complaint or any other similar written statement ensure that it is sent to the competent authority and always through the hierarchical channels the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under articles and of the convention that his conviction by the domestic courts for aggravated defamation had infringed his right to freedom of expression the court being master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of the case will consider this complaint solely under article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions the applicant submitted that his right to freedom of expression had been breached in that he had been convicted for denouncing an alleged misuse of public money within the national republican guard he maintained that he had acted in good faith in disclosing the suspicion of alleged misuse of money as the veracity of the rumour could only be proved by means of an investigation the only reason for his disclosure was to have the alleged facts investigated the applicant acknowledged that he could have used the existing channels within the internal hierarchy of the national republican guard to make the disclosure however he contended that the disclosure was made by email to an authority which had competence within the ministry of home affairs to investigate the alleged facts as such he had complied with the chain of command he concluded that demanding that the disclosure of information be made only within the hierarchy of the general republican guard would limit freedom of expression referring to the case of heinisch v germany no echr the government contended that the protection of the workplace afforded by article of the convention could be guaranteed only when a disclosure of information was made in good faith and favoured the internal channels of disclosure they considered that the allegations reported by the applicant could have been an issue of public interest given that the alleged misuse of public money was at stake however the applicants allegations were based on a rumour which was none the less investigated by three different entities and not proved the government submitted that the duty of loyalty was particularly binding on servicemen in the national republican guard who were subject to special duties arising from the disciplinary regulations to which they were bound the applicant was subject to a chain of command and should have disclosed the allegations to his hierarchical superiors namely the commander of his territorial post or the commander of the territorial unit there were internal channels of disclosure which where used had been proven effective lastly the government submitted that past events the fact that the applicant had allegedly been fined by commander mc and that there was a poor relationship between commander mc and the servicemen working at the arganil territorial post could lead to suspicion that the applicant may have felt some animosity towards commander mc the courts assessment it has not been disputed that the applicants conviction by the domestic courts for aggravated defamation constituted interference by the public authorities with his right to freedom of expression under the first paragraph of article of the convention such interference will constitute a breach of article unless it was prescribed by law pursued one or more legitimate aims under paragraph and was necessary in a democratic society for the achievement of those aims the court observes that the applicants conviction was based on article and article of the portuguese criminal code and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting commander mcs reputation it remains to be ascertained whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society a the principles established by the courts caselaw the court reiterates that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfillment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society as set forth in article this freedom is subject to exceptions which must however be constructed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly the general principles for assessing the necessity of an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression have been summarised recently in pentikäinen v finland gc no echr and bédat v switzerland gc no march the court further reiterates that the protection of article of the convention extends to the workplace in general and to the public service in particular see among other authorities guja v moldova gc no february furthermore under the courts caselaw the signaling by an employee in the public sector of illegal conduct or wrongdoing in the workplace should in certain circumstances enjoy protection this may be called for where the employee concerned is the only person or part of a small category of persons aware of what is happening at work and is thus best placed to act in the public interest by alerting the employer or the public at large see guja cited above and heinisch v germany no july the court is at the same time mindful that employees owe to their employer a duty of loyalty reserve and discretion in the light of these duties disclosure should be made in the first place to the persons superior or other competent authority or body it is only where this is clearly impracticable that the information can as a last resort be disclosed to the public in assessing whether the restriction on freedom of expression was proportionate the court must therefore take into account whether the applicant had any other effective means of remedying the wrongdoing which he or she intended to uncover see guja cited above heinisch cited above the court also reiterates that when it is called upon to rule on a conflict between two rights that are equally protected by the convention it must weight up the interests at stake the state is called upon to guarantee both rights and if the protection of one leads to an interference with the other to choose adequate means to make this interference proportionate to the aim pursued in this context the court accepts that the state has a wide margin of appreciation see fernández martínez v spain gc no echr in the present case the court must ascertain whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance between on the one hand the applicants right to freedom of expression under article and on the other the protection of reputation of commander mc a right which as an aspect of private life is protected by article of the convention see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no november in this regard the courts task is not to take the place of the national courts but rather to review under article in the light of the case as a whole the decisions they have taken pursuant to their discretionary powers see stankiewicz and others v poland no no november b application of the above principles to the present case turning to the facts of the present case the court agrees with the governments position that the applicants allegations could concern an important question of public interest the possible misuse of public money by a civil servant see paragraph above it notes that the defamation claim originated in the applicants correspondence with the general inspectorate of internal administration which forwarded the applicants email to the general command of the national republican guard and to the lousã public prosecutors office in his email the applicant alleged that commander mc had been misusing public money he claimed that his intention was to prompt an investigation into the allegations which he admitted were based on a rumour see paragraph above in order to assess the justification of a statement which is in issue a distinction must be made between statements of fact and value judgments while the existence of facts can be demonstrated the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article see among other authorities pinto pinheiro marques v portugal no january the court considers that in the present case the applicants allegations constituted a statement of fact for a civil servant working for a lawenforcement authority the accusation that he misused public money was a particularly serious one capable of affecting his reputation and to an even larger extent that of the national republican guard thus even if the applicant had intended to prompt an investigation he had to have a factual basis on which to base his allegations however he based his allegations on a mere rumour and had no evidence to support them the court therefore concludes that the domestic courts finding that he had not acted in good faith see paragraph above was proportional and justified in this regard the situation differs from that examined by the court in the case bargão and domingos correia v portugal nos and where the applicants believed that the information disclosed was true and were able to prove it ibid in fact the applicant knowing that his allegations were based on a rumour made no attempt to verify their authenticity before reporting them to the general inspectorate of internal administration the court notes that the applicant had no evidence to support his allegations and that none of the three different entities which investigated them were able to establish their veracity additionally none of the three entities established that commander mc had committed a criminal act or had acted unlawfully see paragraphs above the court further notes that in the criminal proceedings against the applicant the domestic courts were not able to establish the existence of the rumour which had given rise to the applicants allegations see paragraph above as to the addressee of the disclosure the court observes that the applicant was aware that he had internal channels within the hierarchy of the national republican guard to which he could have reported the rumour namely as pointed out by the government the commander of his territorial post or the commander of the territorial unit see paragraph above notwithstanding that he did not convincingly explain why he did not disclose the allegations to a superior by not doing so the applicant did not comply with the chain of command and denied his hierarchical superior the opportunity to investigate the veracity of the allegations in the light of the above the instant case has therefore to be distinguished from cases of justified information of the superior or whistleblowing an action warranting special protection under article of the convention compare with guja and heinisch both cited above finally as regards the proportionality of the sanction the court notes that the applicant was ordered to pay a fine of dayfines eur plus eur in damages to commander mc those amounts appear very moderate taking into account the gravity of the applicants allegations the harm caused to mc and the fact that the applicable maximum fine was daysfine according to articles and of the criminal code therefore the sanction imposed can not be found disproportionate having regard to the above considerations the court considers that the reasons advanced by the domestic courts in support of their decisions were relevant and sufficient and that the interference was not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued namely the protection of reputation the interference could thus be reasonably considered necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of paragraph of article of the convention therefore the court sees no serious reason to substitute its own assessment for that of the domestic courts which examined the question at issue with care and in line with the principles laid down by the courts caselaw accordingly there has been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the application admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on june pursuant to rule and of the rules of court marialena tsirli

throughout the country as he is the main suspect in a case of breaking and entering at the headquarters of the psd in suceava sa aged is suspected of being one of the organisers of the burglary of the local headquarters of the governing party committed at the end of last year the night before christmas eve was marked by bad luck for the psd in suceava as thieves visited their headquarters on the morning of december some of the members of this party arrived at the headquarters located in the centre of suceava and noticed that the headquarters had been ravaged after checking inside they realised there had been a burglary and that the thieves had stolen two televisions and approximately rol while searching for valuables the thieves vandalised the offices breaking all the doors and yanking the televisions from the electric sockets following an investigation by the suceava police the main suspect was identified as sa who has been missing from his place of residence since that date sa see photo fled in order to avoid criminal investigation for the offence of aggravated theft and so a general search has been instituted and his photograph has been sent to judicial service police officers throughout the country in a case where someone tries to avoid getting nicked pârnaie by fleeing despite being sought by the police a countywide search is launched if the person is not found within ninety days the police launch a national search in a case where there is information that the person has left the country an international arrest warrant is issued and the arrest of the fugitive is only a matter of time following the publication of the article the father of sa sent a letter to the newspaper which read as follows to the editor of monitorul de suceava the undersigned ad found out from your newspaper that there was a national and local search order for my son as for the offence of aggravated theft regarding the content of the article i can tell you that at the time my son was neither in the country nor in suceava county as he was in italy the employees of the suceava county police inspectorate promptly informed me that there had been a mistake and that the general search for my son had been called off the document confirming this information is available to the public from the suceava judicial service my wish would be to have the article retracted this letter was published in the newspaper on august b firstinstance proceedings on september sa lodged with the suceava district court a criminal complaint against the applicant for the offence of defamation as prescribed at the time by article of the romanian criminal code after explaining that at the time of the theft he was in italy and thus it was impossible for him to have participated in the alleged offence he mentioned that once his father had found out about the article he had written to the newspaper asking that it be retracted the letter was published unedited but nothing else was done since then sa considered that the article contained serious allegations which considerably affected his public image causing him personal suffering he therefore requested that those responsible be convicted and ordered to pay him nonpecuniary damages in the amount of rol in his defence the applicant submitted that the information concerning the general search for sa as well as the photograph of sa were given to him on august by the suceava judicial service and thus there had been no reason for him to doubt it he contended that at the time of the publication the general search order issued in respect of sa was valid he further argued that he did publish a retraction in the newspaper namely the letter of sas father on october the head of the police department of suceava informed the firstinstance court that in response to your letter in which you enquire whether on august a general search order was outstanding against sa i wish to inform you that on december by order no of the general inspectorate of the romanian police a general search order was issued in respect of this person as he was attempting to avoid criminal investigation while under suspicion of theft the measure was revoked by order no s of the general inspectorate of the romanian police on september after clarification of sas situation on november the court acquitted the applicant of the charge of defamation however it ordered the applicant to pay jointly with the newspaper the sum of rol to sa the relevant excerpts from the judgment read as follows taking into account the fact that the applicant obtained information concerning the suspect from the judicial office within the general police inspectorate he can not be found to have deliberately mens rea defamed the plaintiff under the civil limb of the action defamation concerns public communication of a distorted negative image of a person which is likely to cause him or her personal suffering and damage to reputation leading to changes such as social embarrassment and injury to selfesteem the firstinstance court considers that publishing the article in the newspaper caused damage to the standing of the civil party moreover it must be noted that although the civil partys father notified the newspaper that the facts published about his son were false the newspaper did not publish a retraction of the article written by the defendant c appeal proceedings by a final judgment of january the suceava county court rejected an appeal by the applicant and upheld the firstinstance courts judgment the court stated in its reasoning the following even though there is no mens rea as far as the offence of defamation provided for in article of the criminal code is concerned given the source of information at the date of the publishing of the article the defendants obligation to pay compensation to the civil party can not be set aside this is because following the discovery of the error he did not publish a retraction in order to try to rectify it the article caused nonpecuniary damage to the civil party which can be repaired only in the manner established by the firstinstance court ii relevant domestic law the relevant

the press to publish or to broadcast the answer within fifteen days from the moment when the judgment becomes final the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the obligation imposed on him by the domestic courts to pay nonpecuniary damages to sa amounted to a breach of his right to freedom of expression he further complained under article of the convention of the unfairness of the trial its outcome being based on judgments which lacked reasoning the court considers that the applicants complaints are to be assessed under article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions the government accepted that the court decisions rendered against the applicant constituted interference with his right to freedom of expression but argued that the interference was provided for by law notably articles of the criminal code and of the civil code and had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the victims reputation the government further argued that the issue raised by this case was the failure of the applicant and the newspaper to publish any rectification or retraction concerning the disputed article once they became aware pending the criminal proceedings started by sa against the applicant that the police had provided erroneous information and that the general search order had been revoked in their view in line with the reasoning of the domestic courts the publication of the letter written by sas father did not qualify as a proper rectification in so far as it had been afforded only very limited space in the newspaper and the readers could not have made a connection between the first article and the letter furthermore since the applicant had not provided any explanation for his omission to publish an appropriate rectification the government contended that he could not be considered to have acted in good faith the government further pointed out that the civil sanctions imposed on the applicant by the courts were proportionate the applicant reiterated that when publishing the disputed article he had relied in good faith on official information which he had had no obligation or possibility of verifying he cited selistö v finland no november and colombani and others v france no echr v and the article had not included any value judgments nor any personal opinions concerning the criminal liability of sathe applicant further argued that by publishing sas fathers letter only a few days after the publication of the defamatory article and in so far as the letter contained explicit details sufficient to clarify the situation of the aggrieved party the obligation to rectify the article had been fulfilled he further claimed that the relevant romanian legislation was not very precise in defining what form an appropriate retraction would take therefore the domestic courts conclusions that he had failed to publish a retraction were ungrounded and arbitrary the applicant further submitted that by publishing the impugned article he contributed to the clarification of sas situation in so far as had it not been for the article the general search warrant issued by mistake would have still been maintained the applicant estimated that in such circumstances it was the police and the investigative authorities who were responsible for the moral damage sustained by salastly the applicant contended that the obligation imposed on him by the domestic courts to pay nonpecuniary damages of approximately euros eur had been excessive in view of his monthly revenue at the relevant time of about eur and thus had a significant chilling effect the courts assessment the court notes that the parties agree that there had been an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression it is further satisfied that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protection of the rights of others namely of sas right to reputation it remains to be ascertained whether the interference was necessary in a democratic societya general principles the courts general principles on the application of the requirement in article of the convention that any interference must be necessary in a democratic society were restated recently in perinçek v switzerland gc no october as followsii the adjective necessary in article implies the existence of a pressing social need the high contracting parties have a margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the law and the decisions that apply it even those given by independent courts the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction can be reconciled with freedom of expressioniii the courts task is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but to review the decisions that they made under article this does not mean that the courts supervision is limited to ascertaining whether these authorities exercised their discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith the court must rather examine the interference in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that these authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts the nature and severity of the sanctions imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference as the court has previously pointed out interference with freedom of expression may have a chilling effect on the exercise of that freedom the relatively moderate nature of the fines do not suffice to negate the risk of a chilling effect on the exercise of freedom of expression see morice v france gc no april although the press must not overstep certain bounds regarding in particular protection of the reputation and rights of others its duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities information and ideas on all matters of public interest thus the duty of imparting information necessarily includes duties and responsibilities as well as limits which the press must impose on itself of its own accord see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no november in this respect the court reiterates that the protection afforded by article of the convention to journalists is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism this concept pertains to inter alia the contents of information which is collected andor disseminated by journalistic means in this context journalists who exercise their freedom of expression undertake duties and responsibilities it will be recalled in this connection that paragraph of article does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to media coverage of matters of serious public concern see mutatis mutandis pentikäinen v finland gc no october and the caselaw cited therein the court further reiterates that a legal obligation to publish a retraction or a reply is a normal element of the legal framework governing the exercise of freedom of expression by the print media and it can not as such be regarded as excessive or unreasonable such an obligation makes it possible for example for the person who feels aggrieved by a press article to present his or her reply in a manner compatible with the editorial practice of the newspaper concerned see kaperzyński v poland no april lastly in cases which require the right to respect for private life to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression the court considers that the outcome of the application should not in theory vary according to whether it has been lodged with the court under article of the convention by the person who was the subject of the news report or under article by the publisher indeed as a matter of principle these rights deserve equal respect accordingly the margin of appreciation should in theory be the same in both cases see among many other authorities couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above b application of those principles to the present case the court notes at the outset that in the case at hand the applicant reported on a matter of public concern that is to say the criminal investigation of a theft for which the suspect was wanted throughout the country and for which he allegedly attempted to avoid prosecution by fleeing as this information proved to have been erroneous and defamatory and in so far as no proper retraction was published criminal proceedings were lodged against the applicant for defamation at the request of the aggrieved party sahowever the domestic courts ultimately cleared the applicant of the charge of defamation in so finding they relied on the fact that the information published had been provided by official sources specifically by the judicial service a department of the local police this authority confirmed before the courts that at the time of publication the facts presented in the article had been accurate in the sense that at that time sa had been wanted an order which had been revoked at a date subsequent to the publication of the article see paragraph above noting that the mens rea was found to be missing the domestic courts considered that the applicant was responsible for the damage caused to the third party by the publication of the article in so doing the courts referred to the fact that a retraction should have been published once the applicant had become aware of the error contained in the article the court would refer to the circumstances of the case as reflected in paragraphs above noting that the letter of sas father pointing out the error committed in respect of his son was promptly published in the newspaper however in spite of the explicit request that a retraction be published in the newspaper this was never done referring to the newspapers failure to publish the necessary retraction sa filed the abovementioned criminal complaint in which he requested that the applicant be punished in criminal proceedings and ordered to pay civil damages see paragraph above in this context the court notes that the pertinent domestic legislation does not clearly lay out the terms for an appropriate retraction thus leaving the matter at the discretion of the editor initially and ultimately of the judge see paragraph above it is in these circumstances that the applicant argued that the prompt publication of the letter written by sas father constituted an appropriate retraction however the court notes that the domestic courts arguments for rejecting the applicants defence and ordering the payment of nonpecuniary damages to sa focused mainly on the fact he did not publish a retraction once he had become aware of the defamatory information see paragraph above while considering it regrettable that the domestic courts did not give more details thereto the court can not ignore the fact that the applicant has never confirmed or made it clear in the newspaper that the impugned information previously published was indeed erroneous and defamatory not even after the respective error was officially acknowledged by the judicial service of the local police on october thus more than one month prior to the delivery of the first instances judgment see paragraphs and above in fact it was the applicants constant submission both before the domestic courts and before this court see paragraphs and above that by publishing the letter written by sas father his obligation to retract had been fully complied with furthermore the court considers that there is nothing in the case file to suggest that the applicant may have attempted to publish a proper retraction but was prevented by the editor to do so see also paragraph above while reiterating the importance of the right of a person who feels aggrieved by a press article to a rectification with a corresponding obligation on the journalist or newspaper the court considers that in the present case the applicant has failed to act in accordance with the principles governing journalistic ethics requiring of him to clearly and explicitly correct any published information which has proved to be erroneous or defamatory furthermore looking into the severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant specifically the obligation to pay nonpecuniary damages of approximately eur the court considers that such an obligation does not appear excessive in view both of its amount and of the fact that the newspaper is bound to pay it jointly with the applicant therefore in the overall circumstances of the instant case the court finds that the solution of the domestic courts struck a fair balance between the competing interests of the claimant and those of the applicant and the reasons given to justify their decisions were relevant and sufficient and met a pressing social need the court also has regard to the award of damages made against the applicant in the context of a civil action and did not find it to be disproportionate therefore the court does not see any serious reason to substitute its own assessment for that of the domestic courts which examined the question at issue in line with the principles laid down by the courts caselaw see mutatis mutandis medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina no october there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court declares unanimously the application admissible holds by five votes to two that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on march pursuant to rule and of the rules of court fatoş aracıandrás sajódeputy registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the separate opinion of judges sajó and tsotsoria is annexed to this judgment asfa joint dissenting opinion of judgessajó and tsotsoriato our regret we have to disagree with our colleagues in the majority we take the view that the applicants article rights were violated in this case on august the applicant a journalist published an article concerning a police investigation on the basis of information which he had received from the police about sa being suspected of aggravated theft and of absconding following the publication of the article sas father sent a letter to the newspaper in the letter the father stated that his son was out of the country and that the police had informed him that there had been a mistake and the search had been called off in the letter the father claimed that the document confirming this information was available at the judicial service furthermore the father requested the articles retraction the letter was published three days after the original publication of the article on september as the journalist had taken no further action sa lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant for criminal defamation thirtytwo days later on october the police informed the local court that the search order had been revoked on september that is to say after the publication of the fathers letter the applicant was held liable for civil defamation the domestic courts attached importance to the fact that although the injured partys father had notified the newspaper that the facts published about his son were false the newspaper had not published a retraction of the article written by the defendant this consideration was held by the court to show that the applicant had failed to correct the erroneous and defamatory information while we disagree with the judgment primarily because we find that the court has departed from its clear caselaw that protects freedom of expression and journalism we have disagreements with regard to the reconstruction of the facts and also to the domestic proceedings in particular we find that the injured partys father was immediately granted the right to reply although he was not a directly concerned party and apparently had no power of attorney moreover it is unclear whether under section of the press act a defamed person is entitled to request both reply and retraction thirdly at the time of the nonspecific request for retraction the search had not been called off there was nothing to retract the search was called off later and this was not known to the applicant until the police provided the information during the criminal proceedings the plaintiff never provided the relevant official information that could have served as a basis for retraction the court itself accepts that at the time it was written the facts presented in the article were accurate the court claims however that the courts referred to the fact that a retraction should have been published once the applicant had become aware of the error contained in the article we do not find such a limited approach in the domestic judgments quoted where the main reference is to the notification by the father at the time of that notification as the present judgment clearly states the contested information was correct moreover the plaintiff in the domestic proceedings at no point requested rectification even though he had thirty days to avail himself of that remedy instead he asked for damages for the defamation contained in the original publication which informed about the position of the police the injured party initiated an action for damages as the original publication had allegedly damaged his reputation during the proceedings it was shown that the police made a mistake the injured party did not alter his plea and did not request rectification nevertheless the journalist was ordered to pay damages for reputational injury for what he had failed to do during the proceedings where he had not even been asked to act in any given manner furthermore we also entertain serious doubts about the assumption that journalists have a duty of rectification whenever they become aware of an error in their article especially if that error is not of their making such a duty is even more problematic in the absence of any request for a rectification when the error becomes known if it really is an error on the part of the journalist a very big if in this case however our major concern is that the judgment which seems to endorse the abovementioned position departs from the clear caselaw of this court in the present case the court allegedly relies on a concept of responsible journalism with reference mutatis mutandis to pentikäinen v finland gc no october and the caselaw cited therein more specifically the court refers to the duty of the journalist or newspaper to enable a defamed person to present his or her reply in a manner compatible with the editorial practice of the newspaper concerned see kaperziński v poland no april needless to say in the present case the right of reply was allowed so the kaperziński requirement of responsible journalism was satisfied but perhaps there is something else in the general principles of pentikäinen even if it is quoted without going into specifics mutatis mutandis that justifies the nonviolation of article the caselaw cited in pentikäinen is bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii fressoz and roire v france gc no and so on fressoz and roire reads as follows in essence that article article leaves it for journalists to decide whether or not it is necessary to reproduce such documents to ensure credibility it protects journalists right to divulge information on issues of general interest provided that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the ethics of journalism see in particular the goodwin judgment cited above p the schwabe v austria judgment of august series a no b p and as an example of a finding to the contrary on the facts prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no p it is true that pentikäinen uses a formula that may be seen as a slight and most unfortunate departure from the traditional position of this court in matters of journalistic responsibilities the court also reiterates that the protection afforded by article of the convention to journalists is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism see mutatis mutandis bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc cited above fressoz and roire v france gc no etc pentikäinen also adds a new element not taken into consideration by the court and not even cited in the present case namely the lawfulness of the journalists behaviour the fact that a journalist has breached the law in that connection is a most relevant albeit not decisive consideration when determining whether he or she has acted responsibly there can be no doubt that there is no issue with regard to this most relevant consideration the journalist acted lawfully it is undeniable that the text of fressoz and roire is not fully reproduced in pentikäinen the relevance of an accurate factual basis was omitted and in accordance with the ethics of journalism was replaced with tenets of responsible journalism this is regrettable especially as there are no reasons given but in the absence of a specific statement to the contrary and in view of the direct reference to the earlier texts of the leading cases we see no reason to assume that the previous standards and caselaw have been abandoned or reinterpreted in any way or sense the role of the court remains the same it has toexamine whether the journalist who wrote the impugned article acted in good faith and in accordance with the ethics of the profession of journalist in the courts view this depends in particular on the nature and degree of the defamation at hand the manner in which the impugned article was written and the extent to which the applicant newspaper could reasonably regard its sources as reliable with respect to the allegations in question the latter issue must be determined in light of the situation as it presented itself to the journalist at the material time rather than with the benefit of hindsight see bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above flux v moldova no no july there can be no question about the good faith of the article which provided reliable information on the search and the reasons it was carried out this is correct factual information the only thing added to the information is that it has assumed that the wanted person was a fugitive this was a logical conclusion drawn from the suspects absence in order to describe the legal situation journalism is not stenography if such comments are not allowed official press communiques will replace the press the source the police was to be considered reliable in the most controversial flux v moldova no judgment even the majority would have accepted that the publication of a reply is a measure complying with the responsibilities dictated by journalistic ethics further the present case does not involve someone being charged with criminal acts in the absence of a factual basis at the material time see bladet tromsø and stensaas at the material time the information was correct it accurately reported the facts of the police search the injured party could have asked the police for a rectification possibly at their own expense after the search had been called off arguably he could also have asked the newspaper after the cancellation of the search but he failed to do so even during the criminal procedure we can not see why it should be a matter of journalistic ethics to provide rectification ex officio and proprio motu where the police mistake comes to the journalists attention in a criminal case against him of course we would have given thought to that possibility had the court given us reason to believe that such an obligation exists the bladet tromsø test requires us to consider the nature of the defamation it was grave but inevitable and certainly not caused by the press which acted as a messenger in a matter of public interest note that the burglary had targeted the headquarters of a political party the majority position is even more surprising if one compares the facts and the reasoning in the present case with that of a number of judgments concerning romania see for all barb v romania no october and further caselaw cited there to our regret we observe time and again that the concept of responsible journalism in the present case in the framework of a non sequitur results in undermining freedom of the press and this case is no exception while there are responsibilities attached to all professional activities when it comes to the press the reference to responsible journalism is disturbing just as when the little adjective socialist was added to democracy responsible journalism is far too often equated with selfcensorship or is perhaps used as a judicial tool to enforce selfcensorship we do not intend to use that tool the term responsible journalism was used in in flux and samson v moldova no october to explain what is said in bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii it was shorthand for judicial respect for journalistic ethics in stoll v switzerland gc no echr v it was used to emphasise that there is no full immunity for journalists in the name of journalistic freedom in matters of criminal responsibility it seems that this idea was transposed to responsibility in general and the fact that journalists can not claim unlimited protection in criminal cases in the name of freedom of expression is now increasingly understood as imposing special duties on journalists in reporting in general in the civil context,,,

and article bis of the code of civil procedure formal requirements regarding the bringing of proceedings before a court and the parties thereto at the hearing of may the applicant indicated that he had deindexed the article in question with a view to settling the case by a decision of march the court excluded google italy srl from the proceedings following vxs withdrawal of his claim against this party by a decision of january the district court of chieti observed at the outset that in the light of the information that the applicant had supplied on may there was no need to examine the part of vxs complaint regarding the request for the article to be removed from the internet as for the remainder of the complaint concerning the breach of the claimants right to respect for their reputation the court awarded to each claimant euros eur in compensation for nonpecuniary damage and eur for costs and expenses the court referred to the applicable legislation on the matter namely articles and of the personal data protection code it noted in particular that the information concerning the claimants had been published on march and had remained accessible on the internet until may notwithstanding vxs formal notice to the applicant asking that the article in question be removed from the internet see paragraph above in the courts view the public interest in the right to provide information had then been satisfied and at least from the date of vx sending the abovementioned formal notice the processing of his personal data had not been in compliance with articles and of the personal data protection code the court then concluded that there had been a breach of the claimants reputation and right to respect for their private life the court also noted that the information at issue was easily accessible much more than any information published in print newspapers taking into account the large local dissemination of the online newspaper at issue by simply inserting the claimants names into the search engine and that the nature of the relevant data as regards judicial proceedings was sensitive the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law by a judgment of june the supreme court upheld the firstinstance decision on all grounds and dismissed the applicants appeal the supreme court noted that the processing of the plaintiffs personal data had been unlawful inasmuch as the article published on march had remained accessible on the internet despite the abovementioned formal notice sent to the applicant asking that the article in question be removed from the internet by vx on september and that the possibility to access the article had been easy and direct the supreme court excluded the possibility that in this case the unlawfulness of the way in which the personal data had been processed had been linked either to the content of the said article to its online publication and dissemination or to its conservation and digital archiving relevant

the committee of ministers under the terms of article b of the statute of the council of europe recommends that member states in consultation with private sector actors and civil society develop and promote coherent strategies to protect freedom of expression access to information and other human rights and fundamental freedoms in relation to search engines in line with the convention for the

engine providers to carry out the following actions enhance transparency regarding the way in which access to information is provided in order to ensure access to and pluralism and diversity of information and services in particular the criteria according to which search results are selected ranked or removed review search ranking and indexing of content which although in the public space is not intended for mass communication or for mass communication in aggregate this could include listing content sufficiently low in search results so as to strike a balance between the accessibility of the content in question and the intentions or wishes of its producer for example having different accessibility levels to content which is published seeking broad dissemination as compared to content which is merely available in a public space default settings should be conceived taking account of this objective iii filtering and deindexing context and challenges a prerequisite for the existence of effective search engines is the freedom to crawl and index the information available on the internet the filtering and blocking of internet content by search engine providers entails the risk of violation of freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention in respect to the rights of providers and users to distribute and access information search engine providers should not be obliged to monitor their networks and services proactively in order to detect possibly illegal content nor should they conduct any ex ante filtering or blocking activity unless mandated by court order or by a competent authority however there may be legitimate requests to remove specific sources from their index for example in cases where other rights outweigh the right to freedom of expression and information the right to information can not be understood as extending the access to content beyond the intention of the person who exercises her or his freedom of expression in many countries search engine providers deindex or filter specific websites at the request of public authorities or private parties in order to comply with legal obligations or at their own initiative for example in cases not related to the content of websites but to technical dangers such as malware any such deindexing or filtering should be transparent narrowly tailored and reviewed regularly subject to compliance with due process requirements action member states should ensure that any law policy or individual request on deindexing or filtering is enacted with full respect for relevant legal provisions the right to freedom of expression and the right to seek receive and impart information the principles of due process and access to independent and accountable redress mechanisms should also be respected

protection of personal data as guaranteed under articles and of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union oj c when a search by means of that engine was carried out on the basis of an individuals name since such processing enabled any internet user to obtain through the list of search results thus attained a structured overview of the information relating to that individual that could be found on the internet and thereby to establish a more or less detailed profile of him or her furthermore the effect of such interference on the rights of a data subject would be heightened on account of the important role played by the internet and search engines in modern society which rendered the information contained in such a list of results ubiquitous in the light of the potential seriousness of that interference it could not be justified merely by the economic interest of the operator the cjeu held that a fair balance had to be sought between the legitimate interest of internet users in having access to such information and the data subjects fundamental rights it deemed that a data subjects fundamental rights as a general rule overrode the interests of internet users but that that balance might however depend on i the nature of the information in question and its sensitivity as regards the data subjects private life and ii the interest of the public in having that information the cjeu held that in certain cases the operator of a search engine was obliged to remove from the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of a persons name any and all links to internet pages published by third parties and containing information relating to that person even when the publication of that information on the internet pages in question was in itself lawful that was so in particular where the data in question appeared to be inadequate irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive given the purposes for which they had been processed

the national commission on data processing and civil liberties commission nationale de linformatique et des libertés cnil refusing to serve formal notices on google requiring it to dereference various links appearing in the lists of results displayed following searches of their names and leading to internet pages published by third parties the cjeu decided inter alia that information relating to legal proceedings brought against an individual and information relating to any ensuing conviction constituted data relating to offences and criminal convictions within the meaning of article of directive ec the cjeu also ruled that the operator of a search engine was required to accede to a request for dereferencing in respect of links to internet pages displaying such information in the event that the information in question i related to an earlier stage of the legal proceedings in question and ii having regard to the progress of the proceedings no longer corresponded to the current situation however the search engine operator in question would be required to accede to a request for dereferencing only if in the course of verifying whether there were reasons of substantial public interest as listed in article of directive ec it had been established that in the light of all the circumstances of the case the data subjects fundamental rights as guaranteed in the charter of

dereferencing and to determine whether the provisions of directive ec required dereferencing at the national european or worldwide level the cjeu ruled that in the event that a search engine operator granted a request for dereferencing pursuant to article b and subparagraph a of the first paragraph of article of directive ec and of article of regulation eu of the european parliament and of the council see paragraph below that operator would not be required to carry out that dereferencing on all versions of its search engine but only on the versions of that search engine corresponding to all the european union states using where necessary measures which while meeting the legal requirements effectively prevented or at the very least seriously discouraged an internet user from i conducting

aepd and mario costeja gonzález c adopted on november by the article data protection working party wp the second part of the guidelines concerns common criteria which the data protection authorities were invited to apply when handling complaints following refusals by search engines to delist search results the thirteenth criterion reads as follows does the data relate to a criminal offence eu member states may have different approaches as to the public availability of information about offenders and their offences specific legal provisions may exist which have an impact on the availability of such information over time dpas will handle such cases in accordance with the relevant national principles and approaches as a rule dpas are more likely to consider the delisting of search results relating to relatively minor offences that happened a long time ago whilst being less likely to consider the delisting of results relating to more serious ones that happened more recently however

impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing the european data protection boards guidelines on the criteria of the right to be forgotten in search engines cases under the gdpr the guidelines on the criteria of the right to be forgotten in the search engines cases under the gdpr adopted by the european data protection board on july read as follows in their relevant parts this document aims to interpret the right to be forgotten in the search engines cases in light of the provisions of article gdpr the right to request delisting indeed the right to be forgotten has been especially enacted under article gdpr to take into account the right to request delisting established in the costeja judgement judgment of the cjeu of may in google spain and google c euc according to article a gdpr a data subject may request a search engine provider following a search carried out as a general rule on the basis of his or her name to delist content from its search results where the data subjects personal data returned in those search results are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes of the processing by the search engine this provision enables a data subject to request the delisting of personal information concerning him or her that have been made accessible for longer than it is necessary for the search engine providers processing yet this processing is notably carried out for the purposes of making information more easily accessible for internet users within the context of the right to request delisting the balance between the protection of privacy and the interests of internet users in accessing the information must be undertaken in particular it must be assessed whether or not over the course of time the personal data have become outofdate or have not been updated the lawalleged violation of article of the convention under article of the convention the applicant alleged that the interference in his freedom of expression namely his right to inform the public had been unjustified he also complained that the penalty imposed on him had been excessive article of the convention reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the court notes that the application is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merits the parties submissionsa the applicant the applicant pointed out that the criminal proceedings instituted against vx had still been pending at the date on which the supreme courts judgment had been issued in respect of his case therefore it could not be said that the period of time during which the information had remained published was excessive thus vxs right to be forgotten had never existed in the first place the applicant submitted that the domestic authorities had not taken into account article of legislative decree no which provided that the processing of personal data for inter alia historical research purposes scopi storici could be carried out upon the expiry of the period allowed for achieving the different purposes for which the data had originally been collected and processed he also referred to articles and of the same decree and to the abovementioned code of ethics which contained specific provisions regarding the protection of journalists freedom of expression the applicant further submitted that he had been unjustly held liable for not having erased the article in question since only the search engine provider that is to say google italy had been technically capable of delisting the article in question the applicant also pointed out that in cases similar to the present one the balance between the protection of individuals reputation under article and the freedom of expression provided by article had been easily secured by simply requiring the publications concerned to publish supplementary information or clarifications to the articles in questionb the government the government submitted that an adequate balance between the applicants freedom of expression and the right of vx and his restaurant to respect for his private life and the reputation of both had been achieved in the instant case the government added that the restriction in question had been prescribed by law namely legislative decree no which clearly stated that the maintenance of personal data was subject to the continuing existence of the objective that had initially justified their collection and storage the aim of journalism namely to contribute to public debate on matters of social political and economic interest should be deemed to be ongoing whenever the knowledge of certain events was still relevant to public discussion in that regard the government submitted that the article had remained on the website of the online newspaper for a substantial period of time indeed no information about the progress of the related criminal proceedings had been provided in the article which had simply recounted the material events the government emphasised that the fact that the applicant had been found guilty had been a consequence of the failure to deindex from the internet search engine the tags to the article published by the applicant which would have prevented anyone accessing the article by means of simply typing out the name of vx or of his restaurant in other words the decisions of the italian courts had stated that the applicant should have deindexed the articles content thereby making it more likely that only people who were genuinely interested in learning the facts of the matter in question would come across the article however the applicant had not been obliged actually to remove the article in question from the internet archives contrary to what the applicant had stated in his observations the government submitted that the obligation to deindex material could be imposed not only on internet search engine providers but also on the administrators of newspaper or journalistic archives accessible through the internetc thirdparty intervenersi reporters committee for freedom of the press this intervener reiterated that the right to be forgotten as recognised by the cjeu in google spain and google and as stipulated by the gdpr see respectively paragraphs et seq and et seq above is aimed at providing users with the ability to request that search engines delist or deindex the results of searches conducted on the basis of a persons name within the convention system this right has to be weighed against the right to freedom of expression and the right to publish information in particular when it would result in the permanent removal of news articles published by the press see węgrzynowski and smolczewski v poland no july this thirdparty intervener also pointed out the essential role played by the press in a democratic society including through media websites and its establishment of digital archives it also pointed out that the court had found that the publics right to be informed outweighed the right to be forgotten in the case of two individuals who had sought to have online media reports about their past criminal convictions anonymised it referred to ml and ww v germany nos and june ii un special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the special rapporteur for freedom of expression of the inter american commission on human rights this thirdparty intervener argued that there was a significant distinction between delisting and the outright erasure of content under international standards regarding freedom of expression the conclusion that the right to be forgotten encompassed the right to demand the erasure of certain news content as opposed to its mere delisting would almost certainly lead to censorship worldwide and the right to be forgotten would be inappropriately expanded to the extent of severely jeopardising press freedomiii media lawyers association the media lawyers association contended that online media archives played a fundamental role in protecting and developing the rights and values enshrined in article of the convention the erasure of accurate information from the record ran directly contrary to the values protected by article and amounted to press censorship accordingly any attempt to erase such information had to be genuinely exceptional and only justifiable where strictly necessaryiv media legal defence initiative the media legal defence initiative argued that the scope of the right to be forgotten should not include the right to secure the erasure or the anonymisation of newspaper articles containing the personal information of individuals in the interveners view articles published by individuals or entities engaged in journalistic activities or by governments should not be delisted this third party also submitted that in the evaluation of the balance between the right to respect for ones reputation and the right to freedom of expression other elements came into play such as whether the complainant had suffered substantial harm how recent the information in question was and whether it remained of interest to the public individuals should not be empowered to restrict access to information concerning themselves and published by third parties except when such information had an essentially private or defamatory character or when the publication of such information was not justified for other reasons the courts assessmenta preliminary remarksi the scope of the case the court notes at the outset that it has dealt with article cases concerning internet publications in which the subject matter was an article or a post with defamatory or offensive content see delfi as v estonia gc no echr savva terentyev v russia no august and kablis v russia nos and april moreover it has previously examined the requirement to publish where appropriate supplementary information or clarifications to an article contained in internet archives see times newspapers ltd v the united kingdom nos and nos and echr which concerned the requirement to append a notice to the articles at stake in that case to the effect that they were subject to libel litigation with regard to article the court has already examined cases in which the domestic courts refused to remove personal data from public internet archives see węgrzynowski and smolczewski cited above or to oblige media to anonymise online archived material concerning a crime see ml and ww v germany cited above the court observes however that the present case diverges from all the article and cases cited above its crux is indeed not related to the content of an internet publication nor to the way information is published as for instance its anonymisation or classification rather it relates to the applicants failure to deindex information concerning vx and his restaurant and to his decision to keep the article easily accessible despite the fact that the claimant had asked that the article be removed from the internet the scope of the case as defined above was also emphasised by the supreme court which ruled out the possibility that the unlawfulness of the processing of vxs personal data arose from either i the content of the said article ii its online publication and dissemination or iii its conservation and digital archiving see paragraph above the court also notes that what is at stake in the present case is the length and ease of access to the data concerned and not their mere retention on the internet in this regard the court observes that the applicant claimed that he could not be attributed responsibility for deindexing the article in question such a possibility being open in his view only to the relevant internet search engine provider the court notes however that this assertion is contradicted by the fact that the applicant eventually did deindex the impugned article on may see paragraph above indeed deindexing can be carried out by an editor noindexing being a technique used by website owners to tell a search engine provider not to let the content of an article appear in the search engines search results in this respect the court shares the governments position that the finding of the applicants liability had been a consequence of the failure to deindex from the internet search engine the tags to the article published by the applicant which would have prevented anyone accessing it by simply typing out the name of vx or of his restaurant and that the obligation to deindex material could be imposed not only on internet search engine providers but also on the administrators of newspaper or journalistic archives accessible through the internet see paragraphs and above the court will therefore keep in mind the scope of the case as described above as it now proceeds to examine the applicants complaintii relevant terminology the court acknowledges that the terms deindexing delisting and dereferencing are often used interchangeably in different sources of eu and international law and that their specific meaning can often only be drawn from the context in which they are used see paragraph above for recommendation cmrec of the council of europes committee of ministers to member states on the protection of human rights with regard to search engines in particular its part iii entitled filtering and deindexing points and the european data protection boards guidelines on the criteria of the right to be forgotten in search engines cases under the gdpr in paragraph above and the cjeus judgment in gc and others dereferencing of sensitive data in paragraphs above within the abovementioned sources the terms deindexing delisting and dereferencing indicate the activity of a search engine consisting of removing on the initiative of its operators from the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of a persons name internet pages published by third parties that contain information relating to that person see paragraph above instead in the instant case the subject to whom was addressed the request to limit access to personal data namely the applicant was not a search engine but an editor journalist and owner of an online newspaper website for the sake of consistency the court emphasises that in this judgment it will use the term deindexing to indicate the measure that the applicant was asked to carry out in order to guarantee vxs and ws right to respect for their reputationb the courts assessment the court notes that it was not in dispute between the parties that the applicants freedom of expression as guaranteed under article of the convention was interfered with by the domestic courts decisions of january and june neither was it in dispute between the parties that such interference was prescribed by law namely by legislative decree no of the court sees no reason to hold otherwise furthermore it is satisfied that the interference in question was intended to protect the reputation or rights of others and thus pursued a legitimate aim under article of the convention as to the question whether the said interference was necessary in a democratic society the court would draw attention at the outset to the specificity and scope of the case at issue see paragraphs et seq above the applicant was held liable not for failing to remove the article but for failing to deindex it thus allowing the possibility for a period whose length has been deemed to be excessive of typing into the search engine the restaurants or vxs names in order to access information relating to the criminal proceedings involving vx in this connection and with reference to the above considerations concerning the scope of the case the court endorses the observations of the thirdparty interveners see paragraphs et seq above which draw a clear distinction between on the one hand the requirement to delist or deindex as in the present case and on the other hand the permanent removal or erasure of news articles published by the press in the instant case the court acknowledges that the applicant was found to be liable solely on account of the first requirement that is to say no requirement to permanently remove the article was at issue before the domestic courts nor was any intervention regarding the anonymisation of the online article in question at issue in this case in the courts view this is an important startingpoint from which to define the interference with the applicants freedom of expression and to identify accordingly the applicable principles in order to assess the proportionality of that interference as to this last point the court has laid down relevant principles to guide its assessment of whether or not an interference in this area is necessary and has identified a number of criteria in the context of balancing freedom of expression against the right to reputation these criteria are the following i contribution to a debate of general interest ii the extent to which the person concerned is well known and the subject of the report in question iii the prior conduct of the person concerned towards the media iv the method of obtaining the information in question and its veracity v the content form and consequences of the publication in question and vi the severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant see axel springer ag v germany gc no february however the court observes that there are factual differences between axel springer ag cited above and the present case the former case concerned the publication by the applicant company of print articles reporting the arrest and conviction of a wellknown television actor whereas as noted above the present case deals with the retention online for a certain period of time of an internet article concerning a criminal case against private individuals there are therefore two main features that characterise the present case one is the period for which the online article remained on the internet and the impact thereof on the right of the individual in question to have his reputation respected the second feature relates to the nature of the data subject in question that is to say a private individual not acting within a public context as a political or public figure indeed anyone well known or not can be the subject of an internet search and his or her rights can be impaired by continued internet access to his or her personal data in the light of the above the court acknowledges that the strict application of the criteria set out in axel springer ag cited above would be inappropriate in the present circumstances what the court must examine is whether in the light of the fundamental principles established in its caselaw the domestic courts finding of civil liability on the part of the applicant was based on relevant and sufficient grounds given the particular circumstances of the case see among other authorities times newspapers ltd and delfi as both cited above see also the more recent case of big brother watch and others v the united kingdom gc nos and others et seq may special attention should be paid in this case to i the length of time for which the article was kept online particularly in the light of the purposes for which vxs data was originally processed ii the sensitiveness of the data at issue and iii the gravity of the sanction imposed on the applicant regarding the first point the court acknowledges that as pointed out by the applicant the criminal proceedings against vx and other members of his family were still pending at the time that the supreme court adopted its judgment in the applicants case however it should be noted that the information contained in the article had not been updated since the occurrence of the events in question moreover notwithstanding the formal notice that vx sent to the applicant requesting the removal of the article from the internet it remained online and was easily accessible for eight months in this connection the applicable domestic law see article of legislative decree no read in the light of the international legal instruments see article e of the updated convention ets no quoted in paragraph above and article a of the gdpr quoted in paragraph above supports the idea that the relevance of the applicants right to disseminate information decreased over the passage of time compared to vxs right to respect for his reputation in this connection compare and contrast éditions plon v france no echr iv where as time elapsed the public interest in discussing the history of president mitterrands time in office increasingly prevailed over any rights with regard to medical confidentiality in that case the court considered in particular that in any event the duty of medical confidentiality had already been breached with regard to the sensitiveness of the data in question in the instant case the court is mindful that the subject matter of the article in question related to criminal proceedings instituted against vx as can also be seen from several council of europe and eu sources article of the updated convention ets no see paragraph above and the judgment of the cjeu in google spain and google see paragraphs above and in gc and others dereferencing of sensitive data see paragraphs above the court is of the belief that the circumstances in which information concerning sensitive data is published constitutes a factor to be taken into account when balancing the right to disseminate information against the right of a data subject to respect for his or her private life concerning the gravity of the sanction the court reiterates that the applicant was held liable under civil and not criminal law contrast tuomela and others v finland no april and savva terentyev cited above although the amount of compensation that the applicant was ordered to pay to the claimants for the breach of their right to have their reputations respected was not negligible the court is of the view that the severity of the sentence and the amount of compensation awarded in respect of nonpecuniary damage eur to each claimant can not be regarded as excessive given the circumstances of this case where the balancing exercise between on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for ones private life as enshrined in article of the convention has been carried out by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down by the courts caselaw the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see among other authorities palomo sánchez and others v spain gc nos and others echr and delfi as cited above the foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the court to conclude that the finding by the domestic courts that the applicant had breached vxs right to respect for his reputation by virtue of the continued presence on the internet of the impugned article and by his failure to deindex it constituted a justifiable restriction of his freedom of expression see mutatis mutandis times newspapers ltd cited above all the more so as no requirement was imposed on the applicant to permanently remove the article from the internet accordingly there has been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimouslydeclares the application admissible finds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on november pursuant to rule and of the rules of court renata degener ksenija turković registrar president the relevant extract of the supreme courts judgment reads as follows by a declaration reported in the minutes of the hearing of the may the representative of the defendant online newspaper belonging to the

64,the applicant was born in and lives in helsinki the applicant is a photographer and journalist for the weekly magazine suomen kuvalehti on september he was sent by his employer to take photographs of the demonstration which was being held in protest against the ongoing asia europe meeting asem in helsinki the demonstration was an exceptionally large one in the finnish context and all media followed it closely before the demonstration took place on august the helsinki police department was alerted by the finnish security intelligence that the upcoming smash asem demonstration would be a hostile one and would not aim to highlight any clear political message the police department did not manage to establish contact with the organisers of the demonstration the demonstration was to start at pm on september a separate area was reserved for the representatives of the media so that they could freely and safely observe the situation and take photographs on the demonstration place at the start of the demonstration bottles stones and jars filled with paint were thrown at public and policemen some demonstrators kicked and hit police officers the police announced several times over loudspeakers that a peaceful demonstration was allowed on the spot but that the crowd was not allowed to demonstrate by marching the crowd tried to break through the police defence line relying on all the information in their possession the police decided to interrupt the demonstration which had now turned violent the police announced over loudspeakers that the demonstration was stopped and that the crowd should leave the scene this announcement was repeated several times hundreds of people then left voluntarily after the escalation of violence the police considered that the event had turned into a riot and decided to seal off the demonstration area first only a few people were allowed to leave the area then the police established several exit routes and people were allowed to leave when leaving they were asked to show id and their belongings were checked however the core group of around people remained in one of the demonstration spots including the applicant and a former member of parliament all of whom had been asked to leave the scene failing which they would be arrested according to the applicant he thought that this request only applied to the demonstrators he claims that sometime later he indicated to the police that he was a representative of the media he further claims that he was wearing his press badge and that a police officer accepted this after having called his colleague the applicant decided to stay until the situation was over a short time later the police arrested the demonstrators when leaving the scene the applicant was also arrested the police arrested altogether persons in the context of the demonstration the applicant was detained from september at pm until september at pm that is hours on may the public prosecutor brought charges against the applicant for disobeying the police niskoittelu poliisia vastaan tredska mot polis under chapter section subsection of the penal code on december the helsinki district court käräjäoikeus tingsrätten found the applicant guilty of disobeying the police but did not impose any penalty on him the court found it established that the applicant had been aware of the orders of the police to leave the scene but had decided to ignore them it appeared from the witness statements given before the court that the applicant had not told or indicated the arresting police officer that he was a journalist according to the arresting officer this fact only became known to him when the relevant magazine appeared it appeared also from the witness statements that two other photographers who had been in the sealedoff area had been able to leave the scene without consequences just before the applicant was arrested the court found it further established that the police orders had been clear and that they had clearly concerned everybody the court balanced the article right against other interests finding that the police had had the right to ask the applicant among others including the former member of parliament to leave the scene the interference with the applicants right to exercise his freedom of expression had thus been based on law and it had fulfilled the legitimate aim of preventing disorder the interference had been necessary in a democratic society in order to put an end to a violent situation however relying on chapter section of the penal code no penalty was imposed as the offence was excusable the court found that the applicant who as a journalist was confronted with contradictory expectations stemming from obligations imposed on the one hand by the police and on the other by his employer by letter dated january the applicant appealed to the helsinki court of appeal hovioikeus hovrätten claiming that the district court should have dismissed the charges against him he argued that his arrest and the fact that he was found guilty were against the constitution and article of the convention the applicant was a journalist and that he had not participated in the demonstration or caused any disorder the district court had not reasoned why his arrest and conviction were necessary in a democratic society and had thereby failed to justify the interference on april the court of appeal rejected the applicants appeal without giving any further reasons by letter dated june the applicant further appealed to the supreme court korkein oikeus

within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions the applicant contested the fact that the police were unaware of his status as a journalist at the time of the arrest his press badge had been hanging round his neck at the end of the demonstration the applicant also claimed that he had presented his press badge to the police when he had been taken to the bus to be taken into custody the applicant pointed out that it had been clear at the scene that he was there to practise his profession as a photographer at the end of the demonstration there had remained about twenty demonstrators sitting in a circle and holding hands the applicant a former member of parliament and the police it had been clear to the police that neither the applicant nor the former mp had in any way participated in the demonstration the applicant had been doing his duty as a journalist it was clear that there had been an interference with his right to freedom of expression the government had not given any reasons why it had been necessary to remove the applicant from the scene nor had they given any reasons why it had been necessary to arrest him and to find him guilty of disobeying the police orders the government noted that the applicant had not been in any way prevented from taking photographs during the demonstration or when the area was being sealed off by the police the applicant had not been arrested for acting as a photographer but for refusing to obey police orders to leave the scene the applicant had been quickly released the next day when the police had found out that he was a photographer for a magazine the domestic courts had not imposed any sanctions on the applicant nor had his camera or other equipment been confiscated he had been allowed to keep all the photographs he had taken and to use them unrestrictedly there was thus no interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression in any event were the court of another opinion the government argued that the interference had been prescribed by law and that it had had a legal basis in the constitution the police act the assembly act and the penal code the interference had had the legitimate aim of protecting public safety health or morals and the rights of others as well as of preventing disorder and crime as to the necessity in a democratic society the government pointed out that the smash asem demonstration had clearly been an event of considerable general importance this had also been recognised by the police and therefore a separate safe area had been reserved for the media to observe the situation freely and safely the applicant and some other journalists had chosen not to take this option the domestic courts had found that the police had had justifiable reasons to seal the demonstration area and to order the demonstrators to disperse since they had not obeyed this order the police had been entitled to arrest and detain them when the demonstration had turned violent the police had allowed the media to move outside the police line two other photographers who had been in the sealedoff area had left the scene and no measures had been imposed on them at any point also the applicant could have left the scene at any point without any consequences the government noted that the intention of the police had not been to prevent the applicant from exercising his profession but only to calm the situation and to restore public order everyone was equal before the law and the fact that the applicant was a journalist did not entitle him to disobey police orders the other journalists had had no need to disobey police orders but the applicant had done so knowingly the district court found it established that the police orders had been clear and that they had clearly concerned everybody the fact that the applicant had also consulted a colleague by telephone and asked for advice on whether to stay or to leave clearly indicated that he had understood that the police orders also concerned him the government pointed out that the policeman arresting the applicant had not noticed his press badge when he had been taken to the bus to take him to custody his id had been requested and he had also presented his press badge however the applicant had failed to mention his profession to the policeman receiving him in the custody room when the police had found out that he was a journalist he had been allowed to call his employer the applicant had been detained from september at pm until september at pm that was hours it had not been possible to interrogate him on the same day as the law prohibited interrogations between pm and am altogether persons had been arrested and detained due to the demonstration the applicant had been one of the first to be released as he was a journalist the government stressed that the applicants arrest and detention had thus been justifiable and could not be regarded as disproportionate moreover the domestic authorities had applied the domestic provisions in the light of article of the convention and had based their decisions on acceptable assessment derived from the relevant circumstances considering the circumstances the interference with the applicants freedom of expression had been necessary in a democratic society the courts assessment whether there was an interference the court notes that the government claimed that there had been no interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression whereas the applicant claimed that there clearly had been the court notes that the applicant was arrested by the police in the context of a demonstration and that he was later found guilty by the domestic courts of disobeying the police however no penalty was imposed on him since the offence was excusable the court considers that since the applicants arrest and conviction were the consequence of his conduct as newspaper photographer and journalist when disobeying the police the presumption is that there was an interference with his freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the convention see juppala v finland no december whether it was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim the court notes that freedom of expression is subject to the exceptions set out in article of the convention the court further notes that the parties agree that the impugned measures had a basis in finnish law in particular in section of the penal code it was thus prescribed by law moreover the interference complained of had several legitimate aims namely the protection of public safety as well as the prevention of disorder and crime whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society according to the wellestablished caselaw of the court freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article of the convention it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society this freedom is subject to the exceptions set out in article which must however be strictly construed the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly see for example lingens v austria july series a no and nilsen and johnsen v norway gc no echr viii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with a european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article see janowski v poland gc no echr i the courts task in exercising its supervision is not to take the place of national authorities but rather to review under article in the light of the case as a whole the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation see among many other authorities fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction the court must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case as a whole in particular it must determine whether the interference in issue was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient see sunday times v the united kingdom no april series a no lingens v austria cited above barfod v denmark february series a no janowski v poland cited above and news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see jersild v denmark september series a no the court further emphasises the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society although the press must not overstep certain bounds its duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities information and ideas on all matters of public interest see jersild v denmark cited above de haes and gijsels v belgium february reports of judgments and decisions i and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii not only do the media have the task of imparting such information and ideas the public also has a right to receive them see sunday times v the united kingdom no cited above turning to the facts of the present case the court notes that the applicant was arrested charged and found guilty of having disobeyed the police his arrest took place in the context of a demonstration in which he had participated as a photographer and journalist a separate secure area had been reserved for the press but the applicant chose not to use it preferring to stay among the demonstrators the court notes that it does not appear that the applicant was in any way prevented from taking photographs of the demonstration as the government pointed out his camera or other equipment was not confiscated and he was allowed to keep all the photographs he had taken and to use them unrestrictedly the court further notes that when the demonstration turned violent the police sealed the demonstration area and ordered the demonstrators to disperse the domestic courts found subsequently that the police had had justifiable reasons to take these measures since these legal and legitimate orders were not obeyed the police were entitled to arrest and detain the disobedient demonstrators the court also notes that the police allowed the media to move outside the police line two other photographers who were in the sealedoff area left the scene and no measures were imposed on them at any point the court observes that the applicant had waived his right to use the separated secured area for the press when he had decided to stay among the demonstrators also after the orders to disperse the district court found it established that the applicant had been aware of the orders of the police to leave the scene but had decided to ignore them the applicant could have left the scene and moved to the secured press area without any consequences at any time while the sealingoff lasted the applicant has not even claimed that he could not have carried out his professional duties from the secured press area by not doing so the applicant knowingly took the risk of being arrested for contumacy the court notes that it is not entirely clear at what stage the police learned that the applicant was a journalist it appears from the witness statements given before the district court that the applicant did not tell or indicate the arresting police officer that he was a journalist according to the government it was only when he was taken to the bus taking him to custody and when he was asked to present his id that he also presented his press badge the applicant however failed to mention his profession to the policeman receiving him in the custody room when the police found out that he was a journalist he was allowed to call his employer the court notes therefore that it appears that the applicant failed to make clear efforts to identify himself as a journalist compare and contrast najafli v azerbaijan no october the court further considers that the applicant was not as such prevented from exercising his freedom of expression and reporting the event moreover he was offered the alternative to follow the demonstration from the secured area reserved to the press his arrest and conviction only related to disobeying the police as he failed to obey their orders as the government pointed out the fact that the applicant was a journalist did not give him a greater right to stay at the scene than the other people moreover the court notes that the applicant was held in detention for about hours as the government maintained the length of the detention is mainly explained by the fact that the applicant was detained late at night and that the domestic law prohibited interrogations between pm and am in addition the court notes that altogether persons were arrested and detained due to the demonstration and that this fact may also have delayed the applicants release however the next day the applicant was one of the first to be released due to his status as a journalist taking into account the considerations outlined above the court finds that in any event any interference with the applicants exercise of his journalistic freedom was only of limited extent given the opportunities made available to him to cover the event adequately the conduct sanctioned by the criminal conviction was not his journalistic activity as such but his refusal to comply with a police order at the very end of the demonstration when the latter was judged by the police to have become a riot in order to assess whether the necessity of the restriction of the exercise of the freedom of expression has been established convincingly the court must examine the issue essentially from the standpoint of the relevance and sufficiency of the reasons given by the domestic courts for convicting the applicant the court must determine whether the applicants conviction struck a fair balance between the public and private interests involved and whether the standards applied were in conformity with the principles embodied in article see nikula v finland no echr ii the court considers that the demonstration was a matter of legitimate public interest having regard in particular to its nature from the point of view of the general publics right to receive information about matters of public interest and thus from the standpoint of the press there were justified grounds for reporting the event to the public this was also acknowledged by the authorities and therefore a separate secure area had been reserved for the press the event attracted a lot of media attention and was closely followed the court notes that the applicant was the only journalist claiming that his freedom of expression had been violated in the context of the demonstration the court observes that the domestic courts found it established that the applicant had understood that the police orders to disperse also concerned him and that he had failed to obey these orders the district court found by referring to article of the convention that the police orders interfered with the applicants right to exercise his freedom of expression but that interference was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim as to the necessity the court found that it had been necessary to disperse the crowd because of the riot and the threat to the public safety and to order people to leave thus the restrictions on the applicants freedom of expression were justified the court notes that the district court analysed the matter from the article point of view in this analysis the court balanced the applicants freedom of expression against the states interests and found that there had been a pressing social need to take the impugned measures against the applicant as to the applicants conviction the court observes that it appears from the case file that the prosecution was directed against altogether defendants who were accused of several types of offences the district court found it established that the applicant had committed a crime by disobeying the lawful orders of the police however the court did not impose any penalty on the applicant as his act was considered excusable he was considered as a photographer and journalist to be confronted with contradictory expectations arising from obligations imposed on the one hand by the police and on the other hand by his employer moreover the court notes that according to the domestic law no entry of the conviction was made on the applicants criminal record as no penalty was imposed see paragraph above in conclusion in the courts opinion the reasons relied on by the domestic courts were relevant and sufficient for the purposes of article of the convention having regard to all the foregoing factors and taking into account the margin of appreciation afforded to the state in this area the court considers that the domestic courts struck a fair balance between the competing interests at stake in sum the court concludes that the domestic courts were entitled to decide that the interference complained of was necessary in a democratic society accordingly there has been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court declares unanimously the application admissible holds by five votes to two that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on february pursuant to rule and of the rules of court françoise elens passos ineta ziemele registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the separate opinion of judge nicolaou joined by judge de gaetano is annexed to this judgment izfepdissenting opinion of judge nicolaoujoined by judge de gaetanoat the time of the applicants arrest on the evening of september he was on duty as a journalistphotographer working for a weekly magazine he had been assigned the task of covering a demonstration held in helsinki against the asia europe meeting asem it was a political demonstration with economic undertones and by finnish standards an exceptionally large one the government themselves described it as an event of considerable public importance there was unsurprisingly strong media interest the authorities expecting such interest made provision for a separate area from which journalists might follow events and take whatever photographs they could that area would presumably afford them some safety and comfort especially if it proved necessary for the police to take unpleasant suppressive measures the measure would not have been regarded as one meant to keep journalists at bay so that while they would have a fair view of general developments they would not be able to spot or adequately distinguish incidents occurring anywhere in the middle of the demonstration or at the far end instead one might reasonably have thought that the use of the area was optional and that a journalist had freedom to move around and mingle with demonstrators in order to get a better understanding of events to obtain statements from participants and in the case of a photographer to take closeups which sometimes speak volumes as it turned out journalists were denied this freedom according to prior intelligence there was a risk of the demonstration turning violent and unfortunately it did the demonstration started at pm and after half an hour the police considered that it had become a riot they took measures to suppress it initially for about fortyfive minutes no one was allowed to leave save for a few individuals then in furtherance of an order to disperse the police created exit routes through which people could go on condition of showing an identity card and having their belongings checked shortly after pm only some twenty persons remained at the scene the police called on them to leave and warned them that unless they did so they would be arrested the applicant was among them still covering the event there is no indication that there was at that stage a threat to public order the riot had already been quelled that is not to say of course that the police orders ceased to have relevance as regards the demonstrators but the applicant was not one of them and it has never been suggested that he did anything inconsistent with his journalistic duties the applicant says that he did not expect that the order would apply to him as well at that stage he spoke about the matter with a colleague over the phone and asked for advice on whether he should leave or stay he decided to stay so as to cover the situation until it was completely resolved he was then arrested together with the others he claims that he was wearing his press badge and had made his identity known according to the government he had not revealed his identity to the arresting officer but when taken to the police bus he showed both his id and his press badge however that made no difference at all section of chapter of the penal code as amended provides that the police may issue an order for the maintenance of public order or security or the performance of a duty and that to disobey would constitute contumacy towards the police a criminal offence punishable by a fine or by imprisonment for up to three months in the present case the order issued orally by the police could also have been orally revoked or varied according to what the circumstances might have required the object of the order was to restore peace by dispersing the crowd in a controlled way it is surprising that it should have been thought that it could also apply to a journalist who was lawfully present and covering the event in the context of his media duties and that it could lead to his arrest the criminal court before which the applicant jointly with many others was charged under the aforesaid provision simply found that he had been aware of police orders that they had been clear and had covered everyone including him and that he had decided not to comply the domestic court having briefly considered article of the convention found that there had been an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression that the interference had a lawful basis and pursued a legitimate aim namely preventing disorder and that the interference had been necessary for the purpose of putting an end to a violent situation still it may be noted that the situation had already been effectively dealt with by the time the applicant was arrested the court found the applicant guilty as charged however it did not impose a sentence it regarded the offence as excusable because it considered that the applicant as a journalist must have faced a dilemma between his duty to his employer and the obligation imposed on him by the police order consequently by law the conviction was not to be entered on the applicants criminal record thus the applicant was first required to obey the police order and then when he failed to do so he had to be arrested and kept in detention for seventeen and a half hours it is to be noted that the domestic court never said that the arrest and detention were wrong or unnecessary subsequently the applicant had to be prosecuted and to stand trial and to be convicted of a criminal offence in the domestic courts view all of that had been right and proper and well deserved but on the other hand the applicant would suffer no further consequences because the offence was excusable the majority are content with that conclusion the applicant brought an appeal complaining inter alia that the trial court had not given reasons why his arrest and conviction were necessary in a democratic society he was obviously right in what he indicated but his appeal was rejected without the court of appeal itself giving reasons the supreme court refused leave for a further appeal it is not known why it seems to me that it was only natural that the situation as it developed would heighten journalistic interest there was nothing improper about that where a demonstration is peaceful the journalists function is essentially one of collecting and transmitting information and quite often adding comment but when tension builds up and violence breaks out whereupon the authorities resort to suppressive control measures the journalist assumes the role of public watchdog and his task then acquires even greater significance as to this role of the press see for example barthold v germany march series a no he is entitled to be in the very thick of things until the very end and sometimes does so at considerable risk to himself the reason is because in a democratic society the public have the right to know what happens during such difficult times this right forms one of the basic safeguards of democracy hardly a day passes by when we are not made aware in one way or another of the need for journalistic freedom to perform that kind of role the domestic courts view that the applicant was inevitably faced with a dilemma as to where his loyalty lay and that this dilemma could only be resolved by giving precedence to the law quite misses the point it does not in my respectful view reflect the true nature of the situation in which the applicant found himself he was not one of the demonstrators he was a journalistphotographer covering what the government themselves have described as an event of considerable public importance how could the police fail to realise the capacity in which the applicant was present at the scene particularly at a stage when he was with a very small remaining group as to whether he was wearing his media badge and whether he made his identity known to the police in good time i have already referred to the controversy on this point the domestic court made no finding on the matter but as i have noted it was accepted that his identity was established before he was put on the police bus to the police station and further one might ask whether the applicant while locked up had not asserted his identity and remonstrated about spending the night in a cell there is a nagging question and it is this did the police really care whether the applicant was a journalist or not the fact that he was prosecuted tends to suggest that they did not it may also be added that if the police or the courts were to have taken the view that the applicants prosecution should have been disconnected from his arrest and detention they would have been expected to look at these aspects separately and to give relevant explanations but they did not the majority take the view in line with the governments position that the fact that the applicant was a journalist did not give him a greater right to stay at the scene than the other people see paragraph of the judgment this aspect is seen as connected with the question of necessity the majority say paragraph that since these legal and legitimate orders were not obeyed the police were entitled to arrest and detain the disobedient demonstrators but the applicant was not a demonstrator and no one has ever suggested that he was the majority seem to be saying that since the applicant chose to stay among the demonstrators and not to use the area reserved for the press he should accept the same fate see paragraphs and again referring to the question of necessity the majority say see paragraph that as to the necessity the court found that it had been necessary to disperse the crowd because of the riot and the threat to the public safety and to order people to leave thus the restrictions on the applicants freedom of expression were justified i would respectfully observe that the majority conflate the meaning of the undoubted necessity to quell the riot with what the domestic court also saw as the necessity of compliance with a police order irrespective of its essence and its rationale an order which led to the imposition of restrictions on a journalists freedom of expression through his arrest detention prosecution and conviction for a criminal offence simply because he had the courage to do his duty in furtherance of the public interest the majority speak of an analysis of article of the convention carried out by the domestic court my own understanding is that at least in the case of the applicant there was no real analysis at all and that the domestic courts judgment was more by way of declaration than based on reasoning it has not been substantiated why it was necessary in a democratic society to equate a professional journalist operating within recognised professional limits in covering the demonstration with any of the people taking part in the demonstration and to impose drastic criminal restraints on him i consider that the order should not have been intended or interpreted as directed against the applicant as a journalist covering the events in question since his presence was not connected with what needed to be countered and resolved i also consider that if the domestic courts were unable to adopt such an interpretative approach they were bound in applying article of the convention to balance the competing interests involved yet they failed to do so it is incumbent on the national authorities to convincingly establish by relevant and sufficient reasons that curtailing press freedom is necessary in the sense that it meets a pressing social need see among many authorities cumpănă and mazăre v romania gc no echr xi the courts caselaw concerning the protection of journalistic sources illustrates the courts concern in this regard see goodwin v the united kingdom march reports of judgments and decisions ii and subsequent cases such as tillack v belgium no november and voskuil v the netherlands no november which are particularly instructive in the latter case a journalist who was called as a witness in criminal proceedings refused to name his source even when the judge ordered him to do so he was punished by detention for noncompliance the court found a violation of article it held that the judicial order was not justified by an overriding requirement in the public interest and so in balancing the competing interests the interest of a democratic society in securing a free press had to prevail there is no indication that any such balancing exercise was carried out in the present case on the contrary the case reveals a onesided attitude on the part of the authorities one likely to create a chilling effect on press freedom for the reasons i have set out i regret that i am unable to follow the majority,,,
65,the applicant the applicant was born on june and lives in tryškiai he joined the lithuanian army during the s in and respectively the commander of the armed forces awarded him the exemplary service and merit medals on august the commander of the armed forces and the applicant who had the military rank of senior noncommissioned officer vyriausiasis puskarininkis concluded a fiveyear professional service contract that contract was to come to an end on august the contract also stipulated that in certain circumstances and in accordance with the rules provided for by the law on military service hereinafter lms see paragraph below it could be rescinded even before that date point of the applicants contract in the applicant graduated from the college of management law and languages of šiauliai region and obtained professional qualifications as a lawyer these were higherlevel nonuniversity studies aukštosios neuniversitetinės studijos by order of the commander of the armed forces of april the applicant was assigned military code as a human resources specialist on august the applicants duties changed he was transferred to the post of assistant on legal matters vado padėjėjas teisės klausimais to the commanding officer of the grand duke vaidotas battalion on march the daily kauno diena published an article war without constitutional rights karas be konstitucinių teisių which was written after the applicant had approached the newspaper with criticism of the new army disciplinary statute adopted by the lithuanian seimas almost unanimously a couple of months previously in the article the applicant argued that the new disciplinary statute restricted a servicemans defence rights when he was the subject of disciplinary proceedings in particular the statute was vague on servicemens right to acquaint themselves with the substance of any internal investigation report against them the applicant also claimed that during disciplinary proceedings a serviceman had only a limited opportunity to have recourse to legal representation which in his view was particularly harmful since few servicemen had the proper legal knowledge to defend themselves in person the article further stated that the applicant discontented with the new statute had conveyed his observations and suggestions to the president of the republic asking the latter to veto the statute according to presidential office sources the president took account of the applicants proposals but decided to promulgate the statute anyway the chairman of the committee of national security of the seimas commented that the committee had received numerous suggestions in connection with the text of the statute all of which had been given serious consideration before the statute was adopted on march the applicants superiors initiated an internal investigation into the applicants actions as regards his communication with journalists from the daily kauno diena and contact with the state president on march kauno diena published a new article criticism of the statute angers the ministry of defence statuto kritika užrūstino ministeriją the article noted that the ministry of defence had initiated an internal investigation after the publication of the first article it further quoted the applicant as stating that disappointed with the seimas for adopting the new disciplinary statute and with the state president for promulgating it he had a right to show initiative as a citizen and under the european convention on human rights to impart information and ideas unobstructed the internal investigation into the actions of the applicant was terminated on march it was established that the applicant had had prior permission from his superiors to address the state president however he had not obtained permission to contact the newspaper the army investigator nevertheless considered that as cited in the article war without constitutional rights the applicant had been expressing only his own personal opinion and had not disseminated any official information consequently article of lms applied pursuant to which soldiers had a right to express their opinions unless there was a conflict with their duties as soldiers or with military discipline no disciplinary penalties were imposed on the applicant on may the applicants superiors concluded that the applicant had failed to perform his duties as a legal advisor namely he had recommended the commanding officer of his battalion to grant childcare leave to another soldier rv in breach of applicable legal norms the army imposed upon the applicant a disciplinary penalty drausminę nuobaudą namely a reprimand papeikimąon appeal against this penalty on april the supreme administrative court held that the applicant had acted lawfully and that his recommendation that rv be granted childcare leave was lawful the disciplinary penalty was quashed on june the applicants superiors signed an order dismissing him from the position of battalion commanders assistant on legal matters with effect from june on the basis of article of lms the order further stipulated that by june documents discharging the applicant from the army should be prepared and submitted to the minister of defence on june the applicant was dismissed from the position of battalion commanders legal advisor on the ground that he had reached retirement age in accordance with articles and of lms on july the ministry of defence issued a decision to terminate the applicants professional military service contract and to transfer him to the army reserve the order was based on articles and of lms whereby a serviceman of the applicants statutory rank had to be transferred to the reserve when he reached fifty years of age on july the applicant appealed to the vilnius regional administrative court asking it to quash the decision of july and to reinstate him into professional military service the applicant also claimed that he had been discriminated against because he had defended another serviceman see paragraph above and because of his views as expressed in the publication in kauno diena in breach of article of the convention the applicant asserted that there were hundreds of soldiers in the lithuanian army who did not have speciality codes allowing them to serve until years of age however they continued to serve in the army until the expiry of their military service contracts even though they had already reached retirement age the applicant thus requested the court on the basis of article of the law on administrative proceedings see paragraph below to oblige army officials to produce certain documents regarding his dismissal and regarding the situation of four servicemen rl vs jš and mi who to his knowledge had continued to serve in the military in the same grand duke vaidotas battalion despite the fact that they had reached retirement age he noted that those documents were in the custody of the battalion commander and he could not obtain them on his own lastly the applicant acknowledged that in the minister of defence had changed the military specialist codes and he had been transferred to other duties those of legal specialist all officers with lawyers duties were given the code of legal specialist but the applicant a noncommissioned officer had not been given a legal specialist code this meant that at that time he had no legal specialist code at all the administrative courts found that under the applicable legislation the applicant was obliged before he could bring a court action to exhaust other nonjudicial remedies namely to lodge an appeal with the minister of defence the applicant then appealed to the minister of defence against his discharge from the army on august the ministry of defence held that the decision to discharge the applicant from the army was lawful and dismissed his appeal on october the vilnius regional administrative court dismissed as unfounded the applicants complaints regarding the annulment of his professional military service contract and his discharge from the army the court observed that under articles and of lms a serviceman must be discharged from the army once his military service contract expired or arba he reached retirement age which in the applicants case was fifty years the applicant had reached the age of fifty on june the court further noted that under article of lms soldiers who had been holding military specialist posts under the minister of defences decision of june could be discharged on reaching years of age however the applicants duties of a legal affairs assistant vado padėjėjas teisės klausimais to the commander of the grand duke vaidotas battalion had not been included in the list approved by that decision accordingly he could not rely on the agerelated exception in addition in another case the supreme administrative court had already held that reaching retirement age was the ground for discharge of a soldier from the military notwithstanding whether or not his military service contract had expired yet ruling of march in case no a the court further observed that article of lms gave the minister of defence discretion to extend in the interests of the military the professional military service of a soldier who had reached the age when he or she should be discharged however this was a matter of discretion and placed no obligation on the minister the court did not address the applicants argument that four other servicemen of his unit had been allowed to continue military service despite having reached the age of discharge nor did it reply to the applicants request for the military service records of those four servicemen in the meantime the applicant also lodged a complaint with the ombudsman challenging his discharge from the army on november the ombudsman refused to examine the complaint on the ground that an identical complaint was being examined by the administrative courts and the law did not allow the ombudsman to deal with such complaints on november the applicant appealed to the supreme administrative court reiterating his arguments of unlawful dismissal and discrimination his appeal statement indicates that he reiterated his request that his superiors in the grand duke vaidotas battalion be ordered to produce certain documents from the military service records of the four servicemen mentioned above who he stated had continued serving in the same unit as the applicant despite having reached retirement age the applicant asserted that discrimination would be easy to prove if the court would help him to obtain the military service records of those four servicemen as regards the military specialist codes he noted that in august he had been granted specialist code on the basis of the military code system established by the minister of defence in thus allowing him to serve until the age of after the minister of defence amended the military code system in the applicant was given military specialist code when in the minister of defence again changed the system of military specialist codes and the applicant was transferred to the post of legal specialist no specialist code was assigned to him the applicant observed that officers who had legal posts had been given the code of legal specialist but that he as a noncommissioned officer did not have such a code above all at present no specialist code at all had been granted to him šiuo metu iš viso man nėra suteiktas joks specialisto kodas lastly the applicant strongly asserted that the lower court had erred in interpreting and applying article and other provisions of lms by a decision of may the supreme administrative court dismissed the appeal in setting out the reasons it observed that pursuant to article of lms a serviceman had to be dismissed from military service once his contract had expired or he had reached the age of discharge unless the duration of his military service had been extended in the applicants case as a noncommissioned officer the age of discharge for him was the court also emphasised that that legal norm was imperative and applied to contracts which were still valid and not to those which had already expired teisės norma skirta reglamentuoti teisinius santykius dėl galiojančios o ne pasibaigusios karo tarnybos sutarties nutraukimo this interpretation also followed from article of lms which provided that a contract could be annulled ahead of time in cases provided for in article of that law moreover the possibility of the applicants military service contract being rescinded had also been mentioned in the contract itself see paragraph above taking into account the imperative nature of article it was the army commands duty and not a right to rescind a contract once the conditions mentioned in that provision had been met furthermore article of lms provided only discretion for and not an obligation on the minister of defence to extend a servicemans military service the supreme administrative court also noted that according to his duties the applicant did not fall into the sphere regulated by article and of the law that is he did not have military specialist status moreover exceptional extension of term of service under article had not been applied to him consequently the facts of the case fully matched the circumstances listed in articles and of the law the firstinstance courts decision was thus fully upheld the appellate court did not address the applicants request for the supplementary documents to be obtained nor did the court deal with the allegation of discrimination against the applicant because of his service status in addition to the administrative proceedings concerning his discharge from military service the applicant also instituted another set of somewhat linked proceedings concerning his dismissal from vaidotas battalion which formally preceded the discharge from military service he reiterated the arguments expressed in the earlier proceedings in relation to freedom of expression the applicant merely mentioned that he had been persecuted for his opinions because of the legal decision he had issued which was favourable towards another serviceman see paragraph above it also appears from the summary of the applicants complaints in the record of the court decision of july see the next paragraph that this time the applicant had made no reference to the publication in kauno diena but insisted that he had been discriminated against because of his social status as a noncommissioned officer visàvis the commissioned officers on july the vilnius regional administrative court dismissed the applicants claim fully upholding the reasoning that in accordance with articles and of lms the army was under an obligation to discharge him from the military because of his age the court also noted that the qualifications required for a legal post had been established by the minister of defence on june one of the obligatory requirements was universitylevel higher education in law aukštasis universitetinis teisinis išsilavinimas accordingly the applicant was not qualified to be appointed to a legal post because in he had graduated from šiauliai college of law and management from the programme of higherlevel nonuniversity law studies aukštųjų neuniversitetinių teisės studijų programa as regards the alleged discrimination against noncommissioned officers visàvis commissioned officers the court observed that different requirements were applicable to soldiers of different ranks to reflect their experience and qualifications as had been established in article of lms similarly by a ruling of october no the government had approved the regulations on military service tarnybos statutas point of which established that all lithuanian military officers are in command of soldiers and noncommissioned officers visi karininkai yra kareivių ir puskarininkių ir liktinių viršininkai given that legal acts established different social status for officers and noncommissioned officers the same requirements could not apply to both the court thus held that the applicants argument that he had a right to serve until years of age and was not to be discharged from the army was based only on his own ideas and erroneous interpretation of the law lastly the court dismissed the applicants claim that he had been persecuted for his opinions having concluded that that claim was based only on the applicants own suppositions and guesses the applicant appealed arguing that he had been persecuted because of his opinion on whether to grant childcare leave to another soldier it appears from the transcript of the hearing of his complaints in the appellate court decision that the applicant did not mention the publication in the kauno diena newspaper on may the supreme administrative court dismissed the appeal noting that the applicants claim had already been decided in another administrative case by a decision of may see paragraphs and above the court confirmed that article of lms provided for two alternatives when a soldier had to be discharged from the army when his contract expired or emphasised by the appellate court when he reached the age stipulated in article of that law accordingly once a serviceman reached the retirement age the army had an obligation and not a right to discharge him the court also noted that it was free to assess evidence to establish the circumstances of the case however the applicant had not provided any evidence confirming that he had been persecuted for the opinion he had given on the grant of childcare leave to another soldier the applicant has been receiving a military pension since july b the four servicemen who served in the same grand duke vaidotas battalion as the applicant it appears from the parties explanations and the documents presented that the situation of the four servicemen whom the applicant had mentioned in his complaints of discrimination to the administrative courts see paragraphs and above was as follows the fiveyear professional military service contract with yearold junior sergeant

she had been promoted to the rank of senior sergeant and thus could serve until the age of c the situation of two other servicemen the government provided the court with two additional examples where servicemen were discharged from professional military service on the ground of age while they still had valid contracts they firstly noted senior navigator air force major vž born in whose contract was valid until october at the age of he was honourably retired from the army in december on the basis of articles and of lms having reached the statutory age which is for a major however it appears from the documents before the court that he was entitled to serve until the age of because he was a senior navigator and thus a specialist as provides article of lms the government also referred to the case of senior lieutenant lp born in he had a fiveyear military service contract signed in march in accordance with articles and of lms a person of lps military rank had to be discharged at the age of however in he had been granted specialist status that of supply officer aprūpinimo karininkas and thus could serve until in june lp had been transferred to a new post which was no longer

service contract to be terminated and for him to be discharged from professional military service the court also indicated that dismissal of a serviceman because of his age was linked simply to age and not to the rescission of the military service contract kario atleidimas iš pareigų dėl nustatyto amžiaus siejamas su pačiu nustatyto amžiaus suėjimo faktu o ne su sutarties nutraukimo faktu on march in case no a the supreme administrative court confirmed its position that article of lms was the ground for discharge of a soldier from military service because of age reached notwithstanding whether or not his military service contract had expired yet the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the administrative court proceedings concerning his dismissal from the army were unfair he relied on article of the convention which reads as follows in the determination of his civil rights and obligations everyone is entitled to a fair hearing by a tribunal a the parties submissions the applicant the applicant argued that the vilnius regional administrative court and the supreme administrative court in their decisions of october and may see paragraphs and had been partial and unfair in that they had ignored his procedural rights given that the essence of his case concerned allegedly unlawful dismissal from military service on a discriminatory basis to fully present his case the applicant had asked both courts to order his battalions commanding officers to provide evidence which he was not able to obtain on his own concerning four soldiers who had served in the same military unit if reaching a particular age was an absolute ground for dismissal from military service those four servicemen should already have been dismissed on the same basis that is their age moreover this should have happened much earlier than when the applicant was dismissed however the courts simply ignored the request without even giving reasons for refusal the applicant thus considered that there was a breach of his right to adduce evidence which was essential to a fair hearing of his claims of discrimination for his views and ideas the government the government firstly submitted that article of the convention was not applicable to the proceedings regarding the applicants discharge from professional military service those proceedings concerned neither the traditional category of civil servants nor did they concern an ordinary labour dispute relating to salaries allowances or similar entitlements the government thus took the view that the nature of the responsibilities of those serving in the armed forces of the state involved a special bond of trust and loyalty and exercise of public power the state therefore enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation regarding discharge from the military and extension of military service contracts it followed that disputes between the state and its military personnel concerning the application of the provisions of the domestic law on discharge from professional military service should not be regarded as civil within the meaning of article and thus should fall outside the courts competence ratione materiae as an alternative argument for incompatibility of the case under the above provision the government noted that article of lms excluded disputes relating to extension of professional military service contracts from the domestic courts jurisdiction the instant case was on the one hand related to allegedly unlawful discharge however on the other hand it could also be regarded as related to the issue of extension of a contract provided the court found that article of the convention applied to the administrative court proceedings at issue the government were fully confident that those proceedings had been fair they noted that it was for the domestic courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of given items of evidence and that article of the convention does not lay down any rule on the admissibility of evidence as such they referred to barberà messegué and jabardo v spain december series a no and galstyan v armenia no november that being so even though the lithuanian courts had the authority to compel items of evidence to be produced in court under article of the law on administrative proceedings those courts were primarily entitled to decide on the relevance of certain evidence in the context of the applicants case similarly under article of that law no evidence had any value set in advance the government considered that having objectively and scrupulously examined the applicants case in the light of the relevant legal provisions the domestic courts had found that the prerequisite conditions necessary to discharge a serviceman because of age established in articles and of lms had been met once the administrative courts had established the lawfulness of the legal grounds for the applicants discharge other circumstances including those related to the military service of four other military officers relied on by the applicant were no longer relevant to the examination of his case lastly the government maintained that the servicemen and servicewomen the applicant had described in his request as not discharged despite their age actually served within the system of national defence in compliance with the provisions of domestic law including the provisions establishing the allowed age see paragraphs above b the courts assessment admissibility the court first turns to the governments objection to the effect that article of the convention is not applicable to the applicants complaint about his dismissal from professional military service it reiterates however that in order for the respondent state to be able to rely before the court on the applicants status as a civil servant or in this case as a professional soldier to exclude the protection embodied in article two conditions must be fulfilled it will be for the respondent government to demonstrate firstly that a civil servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and secondly that the exclusion of the rights under article for the civil servant is justified see vilho eskelinen and others v finland gc no echr ii also see igor vasilchenko v russia no february in the present case it is common ground that the applicant served in the army on the basis of a professional military service contract concluded between him and the ministry of defence on august it is true that the first paragraph of article of lms excludes disputes regarding acceptance for military service or extension of military service contracts nevertheless the court observes that the applicants dispute concerned his dismissal from professional military service nor was the matter of his dispute the extension of his contract in fact he had claimed the right civil in its nature to continue professional military service until the expiry of the contract he already had the dispute was genuine and serious and the result of the proceedings was directly decisive for the right in question it is also plain from the facts that as regards his dismissal from the military the applicant had access to administrative courts under national law in accordance with the second paragraph article of lms accordingly article is applicable the court further considers that this part of the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention no other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established therefore it should be declared admissible merits the applicant was dissatisfied that when examining his complaint of dismissal from the military service on discriminatory grounds the administrative courts had based their decisions merely on an interpretation of article of lms and had ignored his repeated requests for access to the military files of four specific servicemen on this point the court observes that one of the elements of a fair hearing within the meaning of article is the right to adversarial proceedings each party must in principle have the opportunity to make known any evidence needed for his claims to succeed see mantovanelli v france march reports of judgments and decisions ii moreover the requirement of equality of arms implies that each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case including his evidence under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage visàvis his opponent see for instance dombo beheer bv v the netherlands october series a no helle v finland december reports of judgments and decisions viii the court has also held that the effect of article is inter alia to place the tribunal under a duty to conduct a proper examination of the submissions arguments and evidence adduced by the parties without prejudice to its assessment of whether they are relevant to its decision see kraska v switzerland april series a no b and van de hurk v the netherlands april series a no that being so the court nonetheless reiterates that it is not within its province to substitute its own assessment of the facts and the evidence for that of the domestic courts and as a general rule it is for these courts to assess the evidence before them see among many other authorities edwards v the united kingdom december series a no b furthermore while article guarantees the right to a fair hearing it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such which is primarily a matter for regulation under national law nevertheless the question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole including the way in which the evidence was obtained were fair see galstyan cited above turning to the circumstances of the instant case the court recalls that in his written complaint to the vilnius regional administrative court the applicant argued that he had been discriminated against because of his opinions he submitted that at least four other servicemen in his military unit had been allowed to continue serving after reaching the age of discharge but before the expiry of their contracts for the applicant given that an allegation of discrimination was at the heart of his complaint a comparison between his situation and that of those four other servicemen was indispensable for him to be able to present his grievance see paragraph above the applicant reiterated that request on appeal arguing that the lower courts refusal to order his military commander to provide evidence related to the service history of those four servicemen had deprived him of the opportunity to show that he was the only soldier to whom the law had been applied so rigorously see paragraph above the court further observes that despite those arguments by the applicant the administrative courts limited their examination to the letter of lms having examined whether his discharge from the army had been justified under article thereof namely because of his age the government have acknowledged that once those courts had established as lawful the applicants discharge from professional military service on that ground other circumstances including those related to the alleged discrimination and those other four servicemen were not relevant to the examination of the applicants case the court can not subscribe to this view whilst being careful not to substitute its own assessment of the facts and evidence for that of the domestic courts the court nevertheless considers that the discrimination aspect of the applicants complaint should have been addressed by the administrative courts although those courts were not bound in law to order the applicants commanding officer to produce the evidence he requested and which the applicant was unable to obtain himself and notwithstanding whether the military service history of those four servicemen would have proved the applicants point that evidence was likely to have a preponderant influence on the assessment of the applicants complaint by those courts see mantovanelli cited above the court strikes a note of caution in observing that article of the convention obliges courts to give reasons for their decisions but can not be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument see van de hurk cited above however given that the applicant had given full details of which specific evidence he wished to obtain and why it was directly relevant to his complaint and to his wish to influence the courts decision and considering that at that stage of the proceedings it was not yet clear whether that evidence was necessary in order to determine the applicants discrimination claim the court finds that the administrative courts failure to assist the applicant in obtaining evidence and to give it consideration or at least to provide reasons why this was not necessary denied the applicant essential means to argue his case in disputes concerning civil rights such as the present one such a limited review can not be considered to be an effective judicial review under article see mutatis mutandis kmc v hungary no july and the caselaw cited therein in the light of the above the court holds that the proceedings before the administrative courts see paragraphs above taken as a whole did not satisfy the requirements of a fair and public hearing within the meaning of article there has accordingly been a breach of that provision ii alleged violation of article of the convention taken alone or in conjunction with article relying on articles and of the convention the applicant complained that he was dismissed from the military for his opinions and in a discriminatory manner the relevant parts of article read as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary article of the convention reads as follows the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in the convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex race colour language religion political or other opinion national or social origin association with a national minority property birth or other status a the parties submissions the applicant the applicant complained of a violation of his right to freedom of speech he maintained that as a serviceman he had been responsible for many years for giving legal advice to the commander of the armed forces on the question of statutory penalties his opinion on the statutory penalties the army imposed on soldiers often did not correspond to that of others at the ministry of defence the applicant stated that he had made many proposals with the aim of improving inter alia servicemens procedural rights when the new army disciplinary statute was being drafted as his superiors and the state president had failed to take his proposals into account the applicant had contacted the kauno diena daily and expressed his ideas to the press the internal inquiry into his communication with the daily had been started the same day even though that inquiry had later been discontinued by the authorities acknowledgement that the applicant had not violated military discipline the appeal to kauno diena and to the state president had had direct consequences for the applicant he was dismissed from professional military service before the expiry of his contract most importantly in order to avoid accusations of interference with freedom of expression the authorities at the ministry of defence chose to dismiss him not on the ground that he had appealed to the media but formally on the basis of article of lms thus leaving no official trace of injustice if that provision had been applied to others in the same manner several hundred soldiers would have been dismissed from service however none of them except the applicant had suffered the same consequences the example of four soldiers rl vs jš and mi he relied on during the administrative court proceedings confirmed that there were more soldiers who should have been dismissed from the army but that this was not done lastly he also challenged as misleading the two examples provided by the government see paragraphs and above the applicant then asserted that the interference with his right to express his opinions had no basis in lithuanian law nor was it justified by any of the grounds listed in article of the convention because his publicly expressed criticism over the staff reform had not disclosed any classified information or posed a threat to the states security the applicants dismissal from professional military service was nothing other than revenge for his public appeal in the media the government the government maintained at the outset that there had been no interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression because he had not experienced any negative effects in relation to the publication in kauno diena they noted that the majority of cases examined by the court under article of the convention had involved either final criminal convictions or civil decisions against a person in the instant case however the internal inquiry into the applicants actions regarding the publication although opened on the very same day as that of the publication march was discontinued on march on the ground that the acts committed by him did not constitute a disciplinary violation of the statute of military discipline because he had acted within the bounds of his right to impart information in accordance with article of lms a mere internal inquiry into the applicants actions which in itself did not create any consequences for the applicant therefore could not be considered as constituting an interference with the right to freedom of expression even if the court assumed that the mere opening of an internal inquiry could be seen as interference the government considered that it was authorised by inter alia article of lms which establishes certain restrictions associated with military service including public expression of disagreement with policies being implemented by the government of a democratically elected state the opening of the internal inquiry into the applicants acts pursued a legitimate aim in the interests of national security and for the prevention of disorder lastly the inquiry was necessary and proportionate given that the applicants criticism of the new statute of military discipline had been expressed publicly and not internally see es v germany dec no november and grigoriades v greece november reports of judgments and decisions vii the government also considered that even if the court did see the applicants discharge from the military as an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of expression that presumption would be incorrect the government categorically rejected any such considerations because the applicant had been discharged in accordance with the domestic law for having reached retirement age and not because of the criticism he had expressed in the article in kauno diena the government also pointed out that in the domestic proceedings concerning his discharge the applicant had raised his allegation of discrimination only very briefly while in essence disputing the interpretation and application of article of lms however having regard to the interpretation of that provision by the administrative courts in the applicants case as well as in other relevant caselaw the applicant was discharged from the military in accordance with the domestic law and there was no ground to allege any possible discrimination in any regard the government further questioned the applicants argument that four other servicemen rl vs jš and mi had had to be discharged from the military because of their age but had nevertheless continued to serve on this point the government referred to the domestic law and facts relating to the service history of those four officers see paragraphs above in this connection the government also saw it as relevant to provide the court with two examples which in their view were analogous to the applicants case where the servicemen were discharged from professional military service on the ground of their age despite the fact that they still had valid military service contracts see paragraphs and above finally the administrative courts had been consistent in interpreting article of lms as having the effect that once a serviceman reached the age of retirement this was an imperative ground to terminate his military service see paragraphs and above above all that interpretation also remained consistent in the applicants case b the courts assessment admissibility the court considers that the applicants complaints are not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention no other ground for declaring them inadmissible has been established they should therefore be declared admissible merits the court has held on numerous occasions that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of that pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society freedom of expression as enshrined in article is subject to a number of exceptions which however must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established see vogt v germany september series a no with further references article does not stop at the gates of army barracks it applies to military personnel as it does to all other persons within the jurisdiction of the contracting states nevertheless as the court has previously indicated it must be open to the state to impose restrictions on freedom of expression where there is a real threat to military discipline as the proper functioning of an army is hardly imaginable without legal rules designed to prevent servicemen from undermining it it is not however open to the national authorities to rely on such rules for the purpose of frustrating the expression of opinions even if these are directed against the army as an institution see grigoriades cited above see also vereinigung demokratischer soldaten österreichs and gubi v austria december series a no the government argued that there had been no violation of the applicants right to freedom of expression because he had not experienced any negative effects from the publication in the kauno diena newspaper on this point the court indeed notes that the internal inquiry into the applicants actions regarding that publication and his address to the state president were terminated on the ground that the applicant had acted within the boundaries of article of lms and no disciplinary sanction was imposed on him see paragraph above the court therefore considers that as far as it concerns that inquiry in itself in view of its outcome the applicant can not claim to be a victim of a violation of the convention however it will nevertheless take that investigation into account when examining the main issue in the present case namely whether the applicants military service was terminated solely as a result of the legal necessity to discharge him because of his age as the government claimed or whether as the applicant argued he was dismissed because of his opinions the court finds that although the sequence of events the applicants critical remarks in kauno diena the internal investigation into his actions a disciplinary penalty for failing to give proper legal advice see paragraph above and eventually the decision to start the procedure to discharge him because of his age assessed in its entirety might appear to corroborate the applicants version of events this does not allow the court to conclude with certainty that the applicant was punished for his opinions and that termination of his military service was not simply the result of a proper application of article of lms see by converse implication ivanova v bulgaria no april in previous cases the court has indeed found that disciplinary sanction for public remarks see es v germany cited above or even prosecution and conviction of the soldier see grigoriades cited above had been a clear indication of an interference with the right to impart ideas at variance with article of the convention however in the instant case such tangible indications are absent unlike the facts in ivanova no new requirements for the applicants post which he did not meet had been introduced after the publication in kauno diena none of the applicants superiors in the army had made public statements to the effect that he should be discharged from the military because of his opinions see in contrast and mutatis mutandis kosiek v germany august series a no it is also noteworthy that the obligation to terminate contracts when the retirement age is reached had been confirmed by the supreme administrative court in its earlier rulings of and see paragraphs and above which preceded the applicants case by some three years and thus illustrate the established practice of the domestic courts the applicant also sought support for his claim of discrimination from the military service record of four soldiers of his unit rl vs jš and mi he considered that those four soldiers had been in a similar situation to that of himself but had been treated differently on this point the court reiterates that article of the convention affords protection against different treatment without an objective and reasonable justification of persons in similar situations see hoffmann v austria june series a no c and vojnity v hungary no february however having given due consideration to the facts paragraphs above it is the courts opinion that such an assertion is not substantiated the professional military service histories of those four servicemen show that each of them was entitled to serve until the expiry of their contracts despite the fact that they had reached retirement age because unlike the applicant they had military specialist codes conversely as the applicant himself acknowledged during the court proceedings at the time of his discharge from the army he had no such status see paragraphs and above in view of the above the court finds that the applicants discharge from professional military service once he had reached retirement age did not amount to interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of expression see harabin v slovakia no november there has therefore been no violation of article of the convention taken alone or in conjunction with article thereof iii other alleged violations of the convention citing articles and article of protocol no to the convention the applicant lastly brought forward a series of grievances which may be summarised as a complaint that his discharge from the army breached the principles of liberty and security caused him pecuniary damage and was not examined by the ombudsman the court has examined the remainder of the applicants complaints as submitted by him however having regard to all the material in its possession it finds that these complaints do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the convention or its protocols it follows that this part of the application must be rejected as manifestly illfounded pursuant to article and of the convention iv application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court finds that there has been a violation of the convention or the protocols thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party a damage the applicant claimed that after his dismissal from the military service before the expiry of his contract he suffered pecuniary damage because he received a lower pension he asked that the government be ordered to review the sums paid for his pension and compensate the unpaid part or alternatively to award him euros eur the applicant further claimed that he had received no salary food allowance or housing allowance which all together were equal to lithuanian litai ltl approximately eur lastly the applicant claimed eur for nonpecuniary damage he had suffered because of the internal inquiry into his contacts with the media and the courts unwillingness to defend his human rights the government considered that the pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage claimed by the applicant were absolutely unsubstantiated and excessive the court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged it therefore rejects this claim on the other hand it awards the applicant eur in compensation for nonpecuniary damage b costs and expenses the applicant made no claims for costs and expenses the court therefore makes no award under this head c default interest the court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the european central bank to which should be added three percentage points for these reasons the court unanimously declares the applicants complaints under articles and admissible and the rest of the application inadmissible holds that there has been a violation of article of the convention holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention taken alone or in conjunction with thereof holdsa that the respondent state is to pay the applicant within three months from the date on which

66,the applicant was born in and lives in weinheim he is a campaigner against abortion and operates an antiabortion website babycaustde at the time of the proceedings outlined below the website included among other things the following content on the starting page a picture of graves was shown and the text underneath read then holocaust upon clicking on the picture the user was directed to a page titled abortion the new holocaust on which the holocaust was compared to abortions on the left margin of the starting page there were several links of which one was called life or death upon clicking on it the user was directed to a page with the headline prayer requests for germany from that page the reader was directed to a locationbased alphabetical list mentioning the names and practice addresses of doctors who performed abortions in germany and to a request for prayers for those doctors at the very bottom of the same page under the highlighted text german contemporary history in brief a sentence read perverted doctors murder unborn children at the request of the mothers pervertierte ärzte ermorden im auftrag der mütter die ungeborenen kinder on the same page clicking on the button close page forwarded the user to a page where it was stated pray if possible regularly for the doctors who personally undertake the aggravated murder of abortion killing beten

that issued certifications are enabling and facilitating the unpunished aggravated murder of children in their mothers womb ermöglichen und begünstigen einen straffreien kindermord im mutterschoβ one of the doctors listed on the applicants website dr q sought a civil injunction ordering the applicant to remove his name and address from the website on may the mannheim regional court rejected dr qs application on the grounds that it was a fact that dr q performed abortions and that the remainder of the websites content was covered by the applicants freedom of expression it observed in particular that the present case was not comparable to similar cases which had concerned an interference with personality rights by the distribution of personalised leaflets the publishing of a doctors name on a list of abortion performing doctors had no comparable pillory effect subsequently dr q appealed and during the appeal proceedings modified his application seeking a civil injunction ordering the applicant to desist from labelling abortions such as those performed by dr q aggravated murder on february the karlsruhe court of appeal granted the sought injunction the court held that the applicants website led it to be understood that abortions performed by dr q constituted aggravated murder while the term aggravated murder did not have to be understood in a merely legal sense but could also be understood as a moral judgment the overall presentation of the website at the very least did not exclude a reading that dr q had perpetrated the criminal offence of aggravated murder even though the applicant had pointed out that abortions were exempt from punishment he had not referred to section a of the criminal code see paragraph below which exempted abortions as performed by dr q from criminal liability in addition the applicant had emphasised the term aggravated murder in the relevant parts of the website and had compared abortions with the holocaust in sum the statements of the website could be understood as a personalised accusation against dr q of perpetrating aggravated murder on may the federal court of justice refused a request by the applicant for legal aid on the grounds that the applicants intended appeal on points of law lacked sufficient prospect of success on july the federal constitutional court refused to admit a complaint by the applicant for adjudication for being inadmissible without providing reasons no bv r ii relevant domestic law and practice article of the german basic law grundgesetz reads in so far as relevant as follows every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech writing and pictures and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources these rights shall find their limits in the provisions of general laws in provisions for the protection of young persons and in the right to personal honour the relevant provisions of the german criminal code strafgesetzbuch read article aggravated murder whosoever commits aggravated murder shall be liable to imprisonment for life a murderer under this provision is any person who kills a person for

be deemed to be an abortion within the meaning of this law in especially serious cases the penalty shall be imprisonment from six months to five years an especially serious case typically occurs if the offender acts against the will of the pregnant woman or through gross negligence causes a risk of death or serious injury to the pregnant woman if the act is committed by the pregnant woman the penalty shall be imprisonment of not more than one year or a fine the attempt shall be punishable the pregnant woman shall not be liable for the attempt article a exception to liability for abortion

sentence that she obtained counselling at least three days before the operation the termination of the pregnancy is performed by a doctor and not more than twelve weeks have elapsed since conception the termination of pregnancy performed by a doctor with the consent of the pregnant woman shall not be unlawful if considering the present and future living conditions of the pregnant woman the termination of the pregnancy is medically necessary to avert a danger to the life or the danger of grave injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman and if the danger can not reasonably be averted in another way from her point of view the federal constitutional court in its leading judgment of may bverf ge accepted abortions being performed by doctors after a pregnant woman had obtained counselling by a third person and developed a rather singular approach by qualifying certain acts of abortion as unlawful but not punishable abortions which are performed without the establishment of a medical indication must not be treated as being justified not unlawful schwangerschaftsabbrüche die ohne feststellung einer indikation nach der beratungsregelung vorgenommen werden dürfen nicht für gerechtfertigt nicht rechtswidrig erklärt werden however abortions performed by a doctor within twelve weeks of conception and following obligatory counselling are considered to be unlawful but are exempt from criminal liability the relevant provision of the conflicts in pregnancy act schwangerschaftskonfliktgesetz reads as follows section refusal nobody is obliged to assist in abortions the relevant provisions of the german civil code bürgerliches gesetzbuch read as follows article a person who intentionally or negligently unlawfully injures the life body health freedom property or another right of another person is liable to pay compensation to the other party for the damage arising from this article if the ownership is interfered with by means other than removal or retention of possession the owner may require the disturber to remove the interference if further interferences are to be feared the owner may seek a prohibitory injunction according to the caselaw of the german civil courts article and in conjunction with article in analogous application of the civil code grants any person whose personality rights concretely risk being violated by another person a claim to compel that other person to refrain from performing the impugned action the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the court of appeals order to desist from labelling abortions aggravated murder on his webpage had violated his freedom of expression as provided in article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or rights of others a admissibility the court notes that this complaint is neither inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remedies see annen v germany no november nor manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions the applicant argued that the court of appeals desist order had interfered with his freedom of expression without being justified by the protection of the personality rights of dr q he submitted that his website had contributed to a public debate and he had not personally attacked dr q who had been only one of the doctors listed on the website an overall assessment of the website showed that his intention had not been to slander a particular doctor but to criticise the legal situation in germany under which abortions performed by a doctor within twelve weeks of conception and following obligatory counselling were considered to be unlawful but were exempt from criminal liability in the light of his contribution to a public debate of great importance possible interferences with doctors personality rights had been justified the government submitted that the injunction by the court of appeal had not violated the applicants freedom of expression the court had carefully weighed the applicants freedom of expression against the rights of the doctor concerned arising from article of the convention in doing so it had recognised the importance of the applicants freedom of expression especially within the context of the public debate about abortion within the scope of its margin of appreciation the court of appeal had come to the compelling conclusion that the content of the applicants website had been such a serious violation of dr qs personality rights as to justify a restriction on the applicants freedom of expression the government further argued that unlike in the case of annen cited above the karlsruhe court of appeal had carried out an extensive analysis of the content of the website and had documented parts of it with screen shots in doing so it had sufficiently examined the applicants statements in the light of the right to freedom of expression and had also addressed alternative possibilities of interpretation as a result the court had concluded that in characterising the medical activities of dr q as aggravated murder and equating them with the holocaust the applicant had committed a serious personal attack and had therefore violated dr qs personality rights the courts assessment at the outset the court considers and this is not in dispute between the parties that the injunction interfered with the applicants freedom of expression had a legal basis and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and reputation of dr q it therefore remains to be determined whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society and whether the balancing exercise undertaken by the domestic courts was in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the fundamental principles concerning the question of whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the courts caselaw and have recently been summarised as follows see delfi as v estonia gc no june with further referencesi freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society as set forth in article this freedom is subject to exceptions which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article iii the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts the court further reiterates that the right to protection of reputation is protected by article of the convention as part of the right to respect for private life see chauvy and others v france no echr vi pfeifer v austria no november and polanco torres and movilla polanco v spain no september in order for article to come into play however an attack on a persons reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be made in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see a v norway no april axel springer ag v germany gc no february and delfi as cited above in cases that concerned allegations of criminal conduct the court also took into account that under article of the convention individuals have a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty see among other authorities worm v austria august reports of judgments and decisions v and du roy and malaurie v france no echr x when examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interests of the protection of the reputation or rights of others the court may be required to ascertain whether the domestic authorities have struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see hachette filipacchi associés v france no june mgn limited v the united kingdom no january axel springer ag cited above and delfi as cited above although opinions may differ on the outcome of a judgment where a balancing exercise was undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see lillo stenberg and sæther v norway no january with references to axel springer ag cited above and von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr turning to the circumstances of the present case the court notes at the outset that the court of appeal in contrast to the courts in the case of annen v germany no november assessed the website with reference to the situation at the relevant time the court therefore concludes that the legal protection received by the applicant at the domestic level was compatible with the procedural requirements of article of the convention as regards the balancing of the applicants freedom of expression and the doctors personality rights the court acknowledges like the court of appeal that the applicants statements addressed questions of public interest it further observes that the court of appeal held that the applicant had stated on his website that the medical activities performed by dr q had constituted aggravated murder and examined in detail how the term aggravated murder had to be understood it concluded that the content of the website had been ambiguous and that the statements could be understood as a personalised accusation against dr q of having perpetrated the criminal offence of aggravated murder it therefore concluded that the applicants statements could be understood as statements of fact since the statements were evidently incorrect the court of appeal ordered the injunction the court reiterates that the classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities in particular the domestic courts see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no having regard to the screenshots of the website provided by the government the applicants statements and the presentation of these statements the court finds the classification by the court of appeal acceptable the court also agrees with the court of appeals conclusion that the applicants statements could be understood as an accusation that dr q had perpetrated the criminal offence of aggravated murder the court of appeal reasoned that the applicant had not made it sufficiently clear that doctors providing abortions in accordance with article a of the criminal code had been exempted from criminal liability therefore the present case has to be distinguished from the case of annen cited above which concerned a leaflet of the applicant in which he had called abortions unlawful but had clearly provided an additional explanation that they had not been subject to criminal liability in the present case however the applicant did not provide such additional information but merely stated that abortions constituted aggravated murder and mentioned only once that they were unpunished see paragraph above this singular reference in the context of counseling centres could easily go unnoticed and did not have to be understood as elaboration of the legal situation in germany according to which doctors providing abortions in accordance with article a of the criminal code were exempted from criminal liability concerning the factual foundation for the applicants statements the court notes that the applicant argued neither before the domestic courts nor before the court that the abortions performed by dr q constituted aggravated murder in the legal sense of article of the criminal code the court therefore concludes that there was no factual foundation whatsoever for the allegation that dr q committed the criminal offence of aggravated murder the court would further add that even where a statement amounts to a value judgment there must be a sufficient factual basis to support it failing which it will be excessive see jerusalem v austria no echr ii consequently the court finds that even assuming that the applicants statements were to be considered value judgments there was not a sufficient factual basis for calling abortions as performed by dr q aggravated murder in that context the court also notes that the accusations were not only very serious something reflected in the fact that a conviction for aggravated murder would carry a life sentence but might also incite to hatred and aggression lastly the court observes that the applicant was not criminally convicted for slander or ordered to pay damages contrast pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi but that the applicant was only ordered to desist from labelling abortions such as those performed by dr q aggravated murder and to desist therefore from implying that dr q was committing that criminal offence having regard to the foregoing and in particular to the seriousness of the accusations against dr q the court considers that the injunction was not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and that the reasons given by the court of appeal were relevant and sufficient the interference with the applicants exercise of his right to freedom of expression could therefore reasonably be regarded by the domestic courts as necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation and rights of others there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously declares the complaint concerning article admissible holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rules of court claudia westerdiek yonko grozev registrar president,,,
67,the applicant is a lawyer who also writes articles for various russian law journals and online legal information databases and networks according to the applicant his work usually requires extensive scientific research including in the field of law enforcement in the khabarovsk region he supported his assertion with copies of contracts with wellknown russian publishing houses and owners of a number of legal magazines including one supervised by the secretariat of the president of the russian federation under the contracts he undertook the task of writing articles on specific topics of legal and social interest having received an assignment to write an article on prostitution and the fight against it in the khabarovsk region on may the applicant wrote to the head of the khabarovsk region police department by registered letter asking for statistical data for his research the relevant parts read i am interested in receiving information for the period between and in particular information on the number of people found administratively liable under article of the code of administrative offences prostitution with a breakdown by sex residence residents of the khabarovsk region or visitors nationality nationals of the russian federation foreigners or stateless persons and the year of the offence information on the number of criminal cases instituted during the abovementioned period under articles and cases related to sexual exploitation of the criminal code with a breakdown of the specific articles and the year the case was opened information on the number of individuals found criminally liable under articles and of the criminal code with a breakdown by sex age educational background permanent residence residents of the khabarovsk region or visitors nationality and period in which the crime was committed general information on sentences imposed on individuals found criminally liable under articles and of the criminal code the types of sentences and in how many cases they were imposed and the years they were imposed i stress that i do not need any specific personal information about individuals found administratively or criminally liable i only need general statistical information for writing a scientific article it appears from an acknowledgement of receipt that the letter reached the khabarovsk region police department on may under russian law state officials must provide a reply to letters from individuals within thirty days in the absence of any response on june the applicant lodged a claim with the tsentralniy district court of khabarovsk the district court complaining that the police authorities had failed to provide him with the information he had requested and requesting for access relying on the information act see below and article of the convention he argued that the officials implied refusal to provide him with the information had been unlawful as he had not asked for access to any confidential personal information state secrets or information related to internal police working methods he claimed that his request had related purely to statistical data of a general nature collected by the information centre of the khabarovsk region police department hereinafter the information centre on july the applicant received a letter from the head of the information centre notifying him that information as specific as he had asked for could only be collected on production of a written order issued by a deputy minister of internal affairs a head of a regional or municipal police department or their divisions or a prosecutor or investigator from a prosecutors office the information centre did not collect such information at the request of private individuals general statistical data summarised by the information centre was provided to the federal service of state statistics and in particular its regional office for the khabarovsk region to whom the applicant could apply for the statistical data on july the applicant wrote to the khabarovsk region service of state statistics hereinafter the statistics service by registered letter asking for the statistical data for his research on july the head of the statistics service replied stating that specific statistical information on the fight against prostitution had never been provided by the khabarovsk regional police department the applicant filed copies of his letters from the information centre and statistics service with the district court on august it dismissed the applicants claim on the grounds that the information centre was not authorised to process data requests from private individuals under domestic law the statistics service was tasked with dissemination of official statistical data on a broad variety of subjects including those falling within the applicants field of interest it also noted that the applicant had failed to obtain the information sought from open sources such as libraries archives and the internet the district court also stressed that the information requested did not touch upon the applicants rights and legitimate interests so the authorities refusal to grant him access to such information had been lawful and wellfounded under section of the information act the applicant appealed arguing among other things that the police authorities had exclusive possession of the information sought by him and that he had no other means including through assistance from the statistics service of obtaining the necessary data in addition he submitted that the fact that his rights and legitimate interests were not affected by the requested information had no bearing on the case as under russian law it was not only those directly concerned who were granted access to public information on september the khabarovsk regional court upheld the judgment of august relying on section of the information act it concluded that the authorities were not obliged to provide the applicant with the information as it did not touch upon his rights and legitimate interests ii relevant domestic law the relevant provisions of the information act federal law no fz of july on

morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a the parties submissions the government the government denied that there had been an interference with the applicants right under article of the convention in particular they argued that the domestic authorities had not had the information sought by the applicant according to the government russian law required information centres to prepare crime statistics reports by processing statistical data cards data cards differed in type and covered a wide range of information related to a specific crime committed the data processing carried out by the information centres was predominantly manual and not all information from the data cards was processed only selected types of crimes and parameters were included in crime statistics reports with respect to the first part of the applicants request for information the government submitted that the authorities only calculated the total number of persons found administratively liable for prostitution and transferred that information to the information centres the specific parameters requested by the applicant the offenders sex residence nationality and the year of the offence were not taken into account with respect to the second and third parts of the applicants request the government observed that the statistical reports produced by the information centres did not include data on the number of criminal cases instituted and individuals found guilty under articles and cases related to sexual exploitation of the criminal code there was no breakdown by the offenders sex age level of education residence nationality or the year of the offence in addition the government noted with respect to article of the criminal code that crimes based on criminal intent to carry out sexual exploitation were not regularly recorded in statistical data cards and thus that parameter was also not taken into account in statistical reports they stressed that crime statistics reports formed by the information centres were published on the official websites of the ministry of interior and federal state statistics service without any omissions turning to the final part of the applicants request the government submitted that the judicial department of the supreme court collected information on sentences the applicant had thus failed to apply to the public authority which actually held the information sought the applicant the applicant insisted that the authorities had had the necessary information referring to internal police instructions on statistical data collection he also claimed that statistical data cards produced by the relevant authorities for example investigators and collected by the information centres contained all the parameters asked for by him he alleged that the information centres calculated those parameters to form crime statistics reports the applicant also submitted that the crime statistics reports available on the official websites of the ministry of interior and federal state statistics service did not correspond to his needs in the alternative the applicant argued that even if the authorities had not had every item of information he had requested they should have provided him with all the relevant data they had the third parties commentsa helsinki foundation for human rights hfhr the hfhr submitted that the right of access to public information was an element of international and national legal systems of human rights protection with reference to the courts position in sdružení jihočeské matky v the czech republic no july and társaság a szabadságjogokért v hungary no april the hfhr advocated for a broader interpretation of the notion of the freedom to receive information the hfhr took the view that the right of access to public documents fell within the scope of guarantees set forth in article of the convention and that any decision to restrict access to documents related to a matter of public interest should be subject to a strict scrutiny in accordance with the requirements of article b open society justice initiative osji the osji stressed that the right to receive information was wellrecognised in various national and international legal systems the disclosure of information including statistical data about the operation of the criminal justice system contributed not only to democratic accountability in the field of law enforcement but also to general respect for the rule of law the osji noted that the court had long recognised a conditional right of access to stateheld information in circumstances where failure to provide such information adversely affected the enjoyment of the right to respect for private and family life the osji reiterated that a state could not restrict a person from receiving information that others wished or might be willing to impart it noted that the court had recognised a right to receive information held by public authorities relevant to public debate irrespective of any personal interest other than an interest to contribute to public debate in addition the osji submitted with particular respect to statistical information that both raw data and the capabilities needed to generate crime statistics tended to be by their nature in the exclusive possession of government agencies granting them a real monopoly over information in that field such monopolies tended to improperly interfere with the free flow of information and ideas b the courts assessment admissibility the court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible meritsa general principles the relevant general principles were recently summarised by the courts grand chamber in the case of magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no november b application to the present casei first three parts of the applicants request with respect to the first three parts of the applicants request in particular information on the number of people found administratively liable for prostitution the number of criminal cases instituted and the number of people found liable under articles and of the criminal code see paragraph above the court observes the following the fact that the information requested is ready and available constitutes an important criterion in the overall assessment of whether a refusal to provide the information can be regarded as an interference with the freedom to receive and impart information as protected by article of the convention see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above accordingly the court has to establish whether in the present case the relevant domestic authorities were in possession of the information asked for by the applicant it follows from the facts of the case see paragraph above and submissions of the parties that although the statistical data cards contained the parameters required by the applicant only selected parameters were taken into account by the information centres and included in the publicly available crime statistics reports those reports as confirmed by the parties did not meet the requirements proposed by the applicant the court notes that the applicant did not seek access to the statistical data cards or even final statistical reports which were ready and available instead he essentially asked the domestic authorities to process and summarise information using specific parameters the court therefore accepts the governments arguments and concludes that the relevant authorities did not have information as specific as sought by the applicant the information he was seeking was therefore not only not ready and available but did not exist in the form the applicant was looking for the court further recalls that article of the convention does not impose an obligation to collect information upon the applicants request particularly when as in the present case a considerable amount of work is involved see weber v germany dec no january the court finds that there has been no interference with the applicants right to receive information as regards the first three parts of the requestii final part of the applicants request as regards the final part of the applicants request concerning general information on sentences imposed on individuals found criminally liable under articles and of the criminal code the court notes that the government did not deny that the required information existed but submitted that it was held by the judicial department of the supreme court see paragraph above the court considers that there was an avenue available to the applicant to access the information which he failed to use in these circumstances it can not be said that the state interfered with or unduly restricted his right to receive information see mutatis mutandis mc ginley and egan v the united kingdom revision nos and echr i there has accordingly been no violation of

68,the applicant błaja news sp z oo is a limited liability company registered in łódź it was represented before the court by mr r kotliński its director the applicant company publishes a weekly magazine entitled fakty i mity in the magazine published an article signed anna tarczynska written by the journalist msz it concerned allegations of unlawful dealings between the lódź public prosecutors office and various criminals involved in drug trafficking its opening paragraphs read as follows an elite group of prosecutors trusted by minister z the then minister of justice are suppressing the truth about a colleague of theirs involved in drug trafficking we presume that the minister is not a drug addict even though he sometimes does look bizarre we also presume that the prosecutors said to be his most trusted collaborators are not junkies why then do they tolerate among themselves a wellknown prosecutor in łódź who is involved in drug trafficking thats how the state creates an army of janissaries the woman in question will now do whatever they want knowing what they can accuse her of on the other hand they might be afraid that she will go public with some charges because it is obvious that she did not consume almost one kilogram of amphetamines herself some time ago gossip was going around the town that the prosecutors amuse themselves at their parties by taking amphetamines an officer of the central investigation office centralne biuro śledcze explains to us but the woman is the most important person in the story prosecutor anna currently works in the investigation division of the łódź regional prosecutors office as recently as april she was hailed in the media and at receptions as a spokesperson of the appellate prosecutors office shortly after prosecutor b became the chief of the latter she disappeared from public view and someone else replaced her the real reason for her disappearance from the public scene was fully understandable for a narrow circle of insiders namely prosecutors who knew the details of investigations concerning a wellknown case involving the disappearance of drugs stored as physical evidence by the prosecution the article went on to describe a drugtrafficking transaction on an unspecified date in a street in łódź referring to statements by two anonymous witnesses charged with drug trafficking referred to as witness no and witness no they stated that they had handed over the drugs to mk who at the material time had been married to prosecutor anna the beauty of it was that at the transaction scene mk had his own security mk came to the scene in a blue renault clio driven by a woman it turns out that it was prosecutor anna who being present in the car throughout the transaction provided a guarantee of security for her former husband in the meantime mk disappeared even though we do not believe that he had been kindly forewarned that he would be arrested the fact remains that prosecutor m stayed the proceedings against his colleagues husband prosecutor anna is unreachable even though the secretariat in the investigation division told us repeatedly that she was in her office she never picked up the phone subsequently the prosecutor described in the article as prosecutor anna brought a civil claim against the applicant company and against rk its president and editorinchief of the magazine she claimed protection of personal rights within the meaning of articles and of the civil code by a judgment of september the łódź regional court allowed the claim and ordered the applicant company jointly with the magazines editorinchief to publish an apology in the magazine it was to be published once and was to read as follows the editors of fakty i mity apologise to ms atk prosecutor at the łodź regional prosecutors office for breaching her personal rights through publishing in its issue no in october untrue information namely that she had links with criminal circles involved in drug trafficking for slandering her with allegations of aiding and abetting drug dealing and for suggesting that criminal proceedings had been instituted against her they were also ordered to pay polish zlotys pln to the claimant as compensation for the breach of her personal rights the court established that the claimant had married mk in the marriage had been in difficulties since approximately her former husband was a businessman he had experienced considerable financial problems since at least the de facto breakdown of their marital life had occurred in the claimant did not know anything about her husbands professional activities the family had one car used essentially by the claimants former husband for business purposes however he often drove their daughter to school and the claimant to the office so that they did not have to use public transport in he left poland the parties divorced in the impugned article referred to the claimant as prosecutor anna and referred to her function as the prosecutors office spokesperson the court was of the view that it made her identity obvious to any reader familiar with legal circles in łódź it was furthermore stated in the article that on an unspecified date she had accompanied her former husband to a meeting held somewhere in a street in łódź a certain sw remanded in custody at the time of publication of the article had told ms ohb a researcher for the magazine about that transaction in which he had been involved together with pt a suspect in another set in criminal proceedings pt was also remanded in custody at the time of publication pt had been the claimants former husbands business partner since approximately he had never met the claimant but had known that she was a prosecutor the journalist msz who wrote the article using a pseudonym had failed to take into consideration the fact that sw was remanded in custody and that he had therefore had an interest in blackening the prosecutors name since she had been involved in certain cases against him his statements should therefore not have been taken at face value ms ohb had met sw in prison posing as a relative however neither the journalist nor the editor had taken any steps with a view to contacting pt in order to obtain information from him that would have corroborated sws allegations the court found that the author had failed to make reasonable efforts to contact the claimant before publication the efforts on the part of the researcher and the journalist to get in touch with her had been completely inadequate all the more so given that they were seasoned professionals the journalist maintained that he tried to call the claimant at her office at least fifty times but the evidence available to the court did not support his statement it was further noted that other journalists had managed to contact her via her office which cast doubt on the veracity of his statement no reasonable grounds had been adduced to demonstrate that it had not been possible for the defendants to get in touch with a wellknown prosecutor working at a publicly known address namely that of the prosecutors offices the court noted that the claimant had acted as a prosecutor in certain criminal cases against sw and pt in criminal proceedings against them in which they had been convicted of drug trafficking they had told the court that they had sold g of amphetamines to the prosecutors former husband in the presence of an unknown blonde woman who was allegedly waiting in the car the criminal court noted that sw had told the court that the claimants former husband had informed him at the time of the transaction that the woman with him was his wife the civil court observed that the identity of that woman had never been corroborated by any other evidence when questioned before the civil court sw stated that he had seen the woman for a matter of seconds and remembered that she was blonde but did not recognise the claimant the court further observed that the claimants former husband against whom criminal proceedings were pending at that time had gone into hiding and it had been impossible to establish his whereabouts in order to make him testify in the case the court found having heard three witnesses from the claimants professional working environment that the impugned article made her identity obvious to anyone working in prosecutors offices and to the police in łódź the article had given rise to numerous comments and conversations it was regarded as an attempt to blacken the claimants name and to slander her motivated by the wish to damage her reputation and call into question her moral standing and professional principles it was noted that she had been attacked by a criminal who had provided information to the journalists concerning his own criminal case after the article was published many people did not know how to behave towards the claimant or what to think of her an embarrassing silence descended when she joined in conversations the claimant had suffered serious stress and had felt seriously wronged by the impugned article the court concluded that the article breached the claimants personal rights blackened her reputation and exposed her to difficulties and disrepute in her professional and social life it lacked objectivity and was onesided its tone was unduly sensationalist and it presented mere conjecture as hard facts the court reiterated that a person exercising a public office should accept that his or her activities were to be assessed by the public opinion and had to accept public criticism it noted that freedom of expression could not be understood as arbitrariness it referred to the provisions of section of the press act which obliged journalists to present true facts to the public the court further relied on numerous judgments of the supreme court by which that court had stressed that journalists were obliged to exercise particular diligence when gathering material and publishing articles such diligence was called for inter alia as regards the obligation to check the veracity of information obtained from third parties in the present case such diligence had not been exercised while it was true that the claimants former husband had purchased amphetamines from sw and pt no evidence had been presented to the court to show that the claimant had been present at the scene let alone acting as security for the transaction the court observed taking due note of the financial statements of the applicant company for that it was in a good financial position and that pln in damages was therefore an appropriate award in the circumstances of the present case the court questioned the journalist msz the researcher ms ohb pt sw and three other witnesses as to the impact that the article had had in the claimants professional environment the court referred to a note and an email from the prosecutors office listing the people who had tried to contact the claimant by phone and to the list of phone calls made to her office the applicant company appealed referring inter alia to article of the convention it submitted that the firstinstance court had erred in holding that the impugned article breached the claimants personal rights given that the defendant had been motivated by the desire to protect socially justified interests that the court had refused to take evidence from the files of two criminal cases with a view to establishing that the claimant had been present at the scene of the transaction and that the court had been arbitrary in establishing that the claimant had not known either what her former husband did for a living or the purpose of the meeting in the street that the information contained in the article had made it possible for readers to identify the claimant and that she had been ostracised by her colleagues as a result of the article by a judgment of december the łódź court of appeal dismissed the appeal it shared the conclusions of the lower court as to the applicant companys failure to act with the diligence which could and should be expected of journalists it stressed that the journalist and the researcher had failed to seek information that could have countered their version of events or dispelled doubts as to the facts it endorsed the lower courts conclusion that the transaction itself had indeed taken place but that the claimants alleged involvement in it had been presented in a tendentious and unreliable manner the court referred to article of the convention and held that the interference was necessary as the applicant company had breached the claimants rights through its insinuations which were not based to any reasonable degree on the available evidence on january the supreme court dismissed the applicants company cassation appeal it observed that the impugned article concerned an event which had indeed occurred namely a drugtrafficking transaction between the claimants former husband and pt and sw however the allegations that the claimant had knowingly participated in that transaction as well as insinuations that she was a drug addict and that she had been passing on drugs on her fellow prosecutors were in the light of the evidence gathered in the case entirely unfounded her rights had been thereby breached the supreme court referred to its own caselaw to the effect that journalists were obliged to be diligent when gathering material for the purposes of their articles but that at the same time they had a right to draw their own conclusions from material thus gathered i ck the press act obliged them to comply with the obligation of diligence by contacting persons about whom they wished to write prior to the publication of such material i csk such an obligation was all the more important in the present case because given the claimants prosecutorial function in cases against pt and sw the testimony of the latter could not be accepted uncritically the journalists had failed to try to contact the claimant had accepted sws statements in an undiscriminating manner and had failed to contact pt prior to publishing the article the supreme court acknowledged that shocking or even insulting publications were also covered by the protection of article of the convention however this protection was not absolute it could be limited by the legitimate aims listed in paragraph of this provision journalists making allegations about individuals were obliged to show that there was sufficient factual basis for their assertions here it referred to cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no echr xi not only should statements of fact be consistent with the material gathered for the purposes of the press articles but value judgments should also have a sound factual basis here it cited dąbrowski v poland no december these principles were equally applicable to situations where the administration of justice or judges or prosecutors were criticised by the press citing barfod v denmark february series a no prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no and lešník v slovakia no echr iv the supreme court reiterated that informing the general public of improper conduct on the part of public prosecutors served the general interest but the guarantees enshrined in article could be successfully relied on only where journalists had reliable and precise information at their disposal that could justify levelling such serious charges against public officials no such factual information had been put forward by the defendants in the present case the courts had not therefore erred in finding against them ii relevant domestic law article of the constitution provides as follows the republic of poland shall ensure freedom of the press and other means of social communication article of the constitution which lays down a general prohibition on disproportionate limitations of constitutional rights and freedoms the principle of proportionality provides any limitation of the exercise of constitutional freedoms and rights may be imposed only by statute and only when necessary in a democratic state for the protection of its security or public order or to protect the natural environment health or public morals or the freedoms and rights of other persons such limitations shall not violate the essence of freedoms and rights article of the constitution guarantees freedom of expression it states in so far as relevant everyone shall be guaranteed freedom to express opinions and to acquire and to disseminate information article of the civil code contains a nonexhaustive list of the rights known as personal rights dobra osobiste this provision states the personal rights of an individual such as in particular health liberty reputation cześć freedom of conscience name or pseudonym image secrecy of correspondence inviolability of the home scientific or artistic work as well as inventions and improvements shall be protected by the civil law regardless of the protection laid down in other legal provisions article of the civil code provides for ways of redressing infringements of personal rights according to that provision a person facing the risk of a breach may demand that the prospective perpetrator refrain from the wrongful activity unless it is not unlawful where an infringement has taken place the person affected may inter alia request that the wrongdoer make a relevant statement in an appropriate form or claim just satisfaction from him or her if a breach of a personal right causes financial loss the person concerned may seek damages the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant company complained that the court judgments in its case had violated its right to freedom of expression as provided in article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties submissions the government submitted that the interference with the applicant companys rights had been compatible with article of the convention there was no doubt that it had had a basis in law and had served the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others as to whether the interference had been necessary in a democratic society the government averred that the statements contained in the impugned article had for the most part been statements of fact it had been stated that the then minister of justice and prosecutor general were tolerating a prosecutor who was a drug dealer furthermore it had been stated as a fact that the claimant had been present at the scene of the drug transaction as a guarantee of security although the claimant had not been referred to by her full name a detailed description had made her identity obvious to local legal circles in particular as her position as spokesperson for the appellate prosecutors office had been mentioned one of the witnesses had confirmed this the claimant had suffered negative consequences immediately after the article had been published the government averred that the domestic courts had found that the allegations about the claimants conduct had not been confirmed by the evidence taken during the proceedings although the drug transaction between the claimants former husband on the one hand and pt and sw on the other had taken place the claimants presence at the scene had not been confirmed the witnesses had seen a woman inside the car but they had not known the claimant personally and had not recognised her before the civil court they had only referred to the fact that her former husband had told them at that time that it was her she had not seen him since when he had abandoned the family the government submitted that the allegations of drug trafficking levelled against the claimant who was a public official were of a very serious character the subject matter of the case was therefore of general public concern however the applicant company had failed to comply with its duties as the journalists had not acted with due diligence and had failed to verify the information on which their allegations were based they should have relied on a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis since the more serious the allegation the more solid the factual basis must be crucially the journalists had failed to contact the claimant the government submitted that the journalists had had recourse to unnecessarily sensational and provocative language admittedly journalistic freedom also covered possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation however in a political context it was legitimate to ensure that debate observed a minimum degree of moderation and propriety the same applied to public officials such as prosecutors the domestic courts had established that the allegations concerning the claimant had been in breach of her personal rights as they had had adverse consequences for her private and professional life the courts had provided extensive reasoning in support of their decisions relying essentially on the journalists failure to contact the claimant and pt on their lack of reasonable efforts to verify sws submissions against other information and on their uncritical acceptance of sws story the government were of the view that the reasons relied on by the domestic courts had been both relevant and sufficient as regards the nature and severity of the penalties imposed on the applicant company the government argued that no criminal proceedings had been instituted in the present case the applicant company had been held liable under the provisions of the civil law only the łódź regional court had merely ordered the apology to be published in the form requested by the claimant the domestic courts order for the payment of pln as compensation and to cover the claimants legal costs had borne a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the damage she had suffered the compensation had been based on a careful examination of the applicant companys financial statements for the previous year and had thus not been excessive the government concluded that courts had struck a fair balance between the restriction of the applicant companys freedom of expression and the claimants reputation the applicant company submitted that a situation where a public prosecutors former husband had been involved in drug trafficking and the prosecutor had herself participated in an illegal transaction called for the closest public scrutiny that situation had justified the strong language used in the article the motivation of the magazines editors had not been idle curiosity but the question of whether the state should tolerate the shocking conduct of its official at the material time the magazine had been opposed to the government in power its conduct should in fact be regarded as diligent restrained and moderate in the impugned article the claimant had been referred to merely as prosecutor anna the courts dealing with the case had entirely failed to take into consideration the fact that a person with her position and visibility should be beyond reproach the applicant company was further of the view that the statements referred to by the government were for the most part not statements of fact but rather value judgments her highly inappropriate presence at the scene of the drug trafficking offence had been confirmed by the testimony given by the witnesses her presence had been intended to serve as a security measure for the illegal transaction this assessment of the situation by the author of the article should also have been seen as a value judgment in any event the statements had a sufficient basis in the material available to the courts the claimant had been present at the scene and had subsequently confirmed this in the proceedings saying that she could not rule out that she might have been in the car at that time even assuming that she had been unaware of the nature of the transaction her lack of vigilance should be seen as disqualifying her from serving as a prosecutor the applicant company further submitted that the national courts had found it well established that the information about the claimant contained in the text made her identity obvious to the public this assumption had been borne out by the testimony given to the court by her friend pk an officer of the special police forces however he had also said that only people who knew her would have been able to make out her identity on the basis of that information the applicant company submitted that the allegations had had a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis when preparing the article ms ohb had met sw one of the drug dealers and interviewed him she had also sent a letter to the spokesman for the prosecutors office asking whether any disciplinary proceedings had been instituted against any prosecutors in łódź there had been no reply to that letter the applicant company argued that the crucial issue for the case was that the claimant a highprofile prosecutor had been present at the scene of the drugtrafficking offence no appropriate explanation had ever been provided she should have been dismissed from her position instead she had won a case against the proopposition magazine which had been critical of the moral condition of the prosecuting authorities the claimant had not suffered any negative consequences the witnesses before the court said that they were aware of a funny article and that there were some mean comments the claimant did not specify what negative consequences she had suffered no disciplinary proceedings against her had been instituted and she had been neither dismissed nor transferred to another prosecutors office the applicant company reiterated that the freedom of the press was strongly protected under article of the convention the press could have recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation it cited prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no it was allowed to use sarcastic satirical or inelegant language referring to nikowitz and verlagsgruppe news gmb h v austria no february it was the right of the press to be shocking offensive and disturbing and the test of proportionality should focus on whether a proper balance had been struck between the legal interests involved that had not been the case in the proceedings concerned in the present case the press could be expected to be unbiased and neutral in the forms of expression it cited for example standard verlagsgesellschaft mb h v austria no no february the magazine published by the applicant company was of a generally satirical character and consequently the article concerned had also been couched in satirical terms satirical statements concerning matters of public interest were by their very nature exaggerated and distorting and as such they enjoyed a wider margin of tolerance it cited for example alves da silva v portugal no october as to the penalty imposed on the applicant company it had not been proportionate in the circumstances of the present case the applicant company concluded that the interference complained of was in the circumstances of the present case in breach of the proportionality requirement imposed on the state under article of the convention the courts assessment the court reiterates that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment see lingens v austria july series a no in this context the safeguards to be afforded to the press are of particular importance see janowski v poland gc no echr i not only does the press have the task of imparting information and ideas the public also has a right to receive them were it otherwise the press would be unable to play its vital role of public watchdog in imparting information of serious public concern see among other authorities observer and guardian v the united kingdom november series a no gawęda v poland no echr ii and kaperzyński v poland no april although the press must not overstep certain bounds in particular in respect of the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information its duty is nevertheless to impart information and ideas on all matters of public interest see jersild v denmark september series a no series a no p and de haes and gijsels v belgium february reports of judgments and decisions i nonetheless article of the convention does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern under the terms of paragraph of this article freedom of expression carries with it duties and responsibilities hence the safeguard afforded by article to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism see for example goodwin v the united kingdom march reports of judgments and decisions ii fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc nos and echr iv and kania and kittel v poland no june in its practice the court has distinguished between statements of fact and value judgments while the existence of facts can be demonstrated the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof where a statement amounts to a value judgment the proportionality of the interference may depend on whether or not there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement since even a value judgment may be excessive if it has no factual basis to support it see de haes and gijsels cited above and feldek v slovakia no echr viii the more serious such an allegation the more solid the factual basis has to be see pedersen and baadsgaard cited above mc vicar v the united kingdom no echr iii and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no the court observes that in the present case the domestic courts decisions complained of by the applicant company amounted to interference with the exercise of its right to freedom of expression the court also finds that the interference complained of was prescribed by law namely articles and of the civil code and was intended to pursue one of the legitimate aims referred to in article of the convention namely to protect the reputation or rights of others hence the only point at issue is whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society to achieve that aim the test of necessity in a democratic society requires the court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a pressing social need whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient see among many other authorities the sunday times v the united kingdom no april series a no and skałka v poland no may in assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation this power of appreciation is not however unlimited but goes hand in hand with european supervision by the court whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article in sum the courts task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities but rather to review under article in the light of the case as a whole the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation see among many other authorities fressoz and roire cited above axel springer ag v germany gc no february von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are also factors which should be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article skałka cited above and kwiecień v poland no january the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith the court must look at the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression in the light of the case as a whole including the statements concerned and the context in which they were made and also the particular circumstances of those involved see feldek cited above the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see among many other authorities hertel v switzerland august reports of judgments and decisions vi pedersen and baadsgaard cited above steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii and mamère v france no echr xiii in the instant case the impugned article published in contained allegations that the claimant who was a prosecutor at the local public prosecutors office at the material time had been involved in drug trafficking the article alleged that she had been present at a meeting held on an unspecified date in a street in łódź while her former husband was purchasing amphetamines from certain persons against whom criminal proceedings were pending at the time of the publication it further alleged that the prosecuting authorities knew about her involvement in the alleged drug trafficking but chose not to prosecute her it also insinuated that she was a drug addict herself and that it was likely that she was sharing drugs with her colleagues see paragraphs above the court has stated on many occasions that issues concerning the functioning of the justice system constitute questions of public interest see kudeshkina v russia no february mutatis mutandis public prosecutors are civil servants whose task it is to contribute to the proper administration of justice in this respect they form part of the judicial machinery in the broader sense of this term see lešník cited above the court takes note of the applicants argument that the character of the claimants public function was such as to justify close public scrutiny see paragraph above the court accepts that personal integrity of public prosecutors is a subject which may be of legitimate interest to the general public however it may be necessary to protect public servants from offensive abusive and defamatory attacks which are likely to affect them in the performance of their duties and to damage public confidence in them and the office they hold see janowski gc cited above and lešník cited above the extent to which such protection might be deemed necessary depends on the particular circumstances of the case whilst in the present case the applicant company considered that it was its duty to alert the public to an important issue of general interest the fact that the article concerned a prosecutor did not exempt it from the obligation to provide a sufficient factual basis for the allegations as regards the categorisation of the statements contained in the article the court observes that the polish courts considered in their analysis that the statements concerning the transaction itself were not devoid of any factual basis however the courts found that the same could not be said of the statements by sw to the effect that the claimant had been aware of and had participated in the transaction still less that she had acted as illicit protection for her former husband in this connection the courts found that sw had never met the claimant that he had relied only on what her former husband had told him and crucially that he had not recognised the claimant before the civil court taken as a whole the courts found that the statements contained in the article referring to the claimants conduct both in connection with the drugtrafficking transaction and the insinuations concerning her alleged involvement in drug trafficking were not supported by the evidence the court notes that the domestic courts took into consideration the fact that the applicant company had invoked article of the convention during the proceedings the firstinstance court referred to the caselaw of the supreme court regarding the obligation of journalists to exercise diligence see paragraph above it also applied the test of adequate diligence in assessing whether the journalists had discharged their obligations the firstinstance court found that the journalists had not exercised sufficient diligence when making their allegations about the claimants involvement which were in the courts view not sufficiently supported by the facts in particular the firstinstance court regarded the effort of the researcher and the journalist to get in touch with the claimant as completely inadequate and observed that no evidence had been submitted showing that msz had indeed tried to call her before publication of the impugned article likewise in their successive decisions the courts criticised the fact that neither the journalist nor the editor had got in touch with pt who had been present at the scene during the transaction and could have confirmed the claimants identity and involvement or dispelled any doubts in that regard in its detailed analysis the supreme court subsequently referred to the caselaw of the court and to the principles formulated in connection with the exercise of the freedom of expression in particular the supreme court noted the distinction which had to be made between facts and value judgments it carried out a careful balancing exercise between the interests involved see semik orzech v poland no november compare and contrast keller v hungary dec no april and kwiecień cited above the court is therefore satisfied that the approach taken by the courts is compatible with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention contrast sokołowski v poland no march zakharov v russia no and october and karman v russia no and december furthermore as regards the reasons cited by the courts to justify the interference with the applicant companys right to freedom of expression the courts observed that the thrust of the allegations against the claimant concerned her alleged involvement in the drug trafficking transaction consequently the courts focused their examination on this essential aspect of the case as to whether these grounds were sufficient the court notes that with a view to establishing the impact which the article had had on the claimants professional life and reputation the firstinstance court heard evidence from seven witnesses namely the author of the article the researcher working for the applicant company both individuals who had participated in the transaction and three further witnesses it also had regard to documentary evidence gathered for the purposes of establishing the measures taken by the journalists in an effort to contact the claimant prior to publication in the light of the above the court concludes that the domestic authorities when justifying the interference concerned in the present case relied on grounds which were both relevant and sufficient the applicant company did not argue that the courts refused to gather evidence which it considered to be relevant for the outcome of the case the court is therefore satisfied that the polish courts gave the applicant company ample opportunity to demonstrate that its allegations had a sufficient factual basis contrast sabou and pircalab v romania no september see also wołek kasprów and łęski v poland dec no october the court further observes that the applicant company was found only to be civilly liable no criminal proceedings were instituted against them by the prosecution authorities the court further notes that the applicant company was ordered to publish an apology in their newspaper for having published inaccurate information of a defamatory character the correction was neutrally worded no bad faith or lack of diligence on the applicants part being implied furthermore the court reiterates that in specific circumstances an exceptional and particularly high amount of damages for libel see tolstoy miloslavsky v the united kingdom july series a no b and independent news and media and independent newspapers ireland limited v ireland no echr v extracts may raise an issue under article of the convention however in the present case the courts when deciding on the amount to be paid by the applicant company as compensation had regard to its financial situation and held that the amount of pln was not excessive it has not been argued let alone shown that that amount was such as to threaten the economic foundations of the applicant company in any way having regard to the circumstances of the case as a whole the court is of the view that the interference complained of may be viewed as necessary in a democratic society

that while employed by pw c he coordinated a fiveperson team and held a post which was not minor but on the contrary was at the heart of pw cs activity which consisted in obtaining the best possible treatment for its clients from the luxembourg tax authorities this description is challenged by the government which relying on the findings that the trial court in the present case would reach submit that at the relevant time the applicant carried out the tasks of an administrative employee and that his duties consisted in gathering centralising scanning saving and dispatching tax declarations to the clients concerned between and several hundred tax rescripts and tax declarations prepared by pw c were published in various media outlets these publications draw attention to a practice over the period from to of highly advantageous tax agreements concluded between pw c on behalf of multinational companies and the luxembourg tax authorities an internal investigation by pw c established that on october the day before he left pw c following his resignation an auditor ad had copied pages of confidential documents including pages of tax documents corresponding to folders of tax rescripts he had handed these over to a journalist ep in the summer of at the latters request a second internal investigation by pw c led to the applicants identification following the medias disclosures about certain of the tax rescripts copied by ad the applicant had contacted ep in may offering to hand over other documents the journalist eventually agreed to this offer and the sixteen documents specifically fourteen tax declarations and two covering letters were handed over between october and december some of these documents were used by the journalist in a second television programme cash investigation broadcast on june a year after the first broadcast on and november the sixteen documents were also put online by an association of journalists known as the international consortium of investigative journalists icij its authors described this publication as luxleaks it appears from press articles that the luxleaks affair led to a difficult year for pw c but that once this period had passed the company experienced a growth in turnover which was accompanied by a significant increase in its workforcethe criminal proceedings brought in the case on a complaint by pw c ad the applicant and ep were charged by an investigating judge and committed for trial before the luxembourg district court by the investigating court the firstinstance judgment on june the luxembourg district court ruling on major offences convicted ad and the applicant of theft from ones employer vol domestique fraudulent access to a system for the processing or automatic transmission of data betrayal of commercial secrets breach of professional confidence and laundering and possession blanchimentdétention ad was sentenced to a twelvemonth prison term suspended in its entirety and to a fine of euros eur the applicant was sentenced to a ninemonth prison term suspended in its entirety and a fine of eur in addition they were ordered to pay a symbolic sum of one euro to pw c as civillaw compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage pw c having limited its claim as the civil party to that amount ep was acquitted on the grounds that he had not taken part for the purposes of the law as a coperpetrator or accomplice in the applicants betrayal of commercial secrets or breach of professional confidence judgment of the court of appeal ad and the applicant lodged criminallaw and civillaw appeals against the above judgment the public prosecutor lodged a criminallaw appeal against the same judgment in respect of the ad the applicant and ep on march the court of appeal of the grand duchy of luxembourg delivered its judgment before analysing the merits of the case the court of appeal noted that the applicants public accusations through communication of the tax declarations of multinational companies were related to the practice initially criticised by ad of issuing tax rescripts that were advantageous to these multinational companies in the same context it also stated that under the caselaw of the european court of human rights the lawfulness or illegality of the disclosed act or conduct is not a criterion in decided whether to grant whistleblower status since the disclosed information might even concern a particular shortcoming or questionable practices as to the merits the court of appeal decided for various reasons related to the domestic criminal law not to examine certain charges brought against ad or the applicant namely breaching commercial secrecy or accordingly laundering and possession or laundering and possession of the proceeds of computerrelated fraud it ruled that in the light of the domestic criminal law alone the firstinstance court had been correct in finding that ad and the applicant had committed the offences of theft from ones employer fraudulent or retained access to a data processing or automatic transmission system breach of professional confidence and laundering and possession of the proceeds of theft from ones employer it held that contrary to the findings of the firstinstance court ep ought to have been regarded as complicit in the breach of professional confidence committed by the applicant and in the laundering and possession of the proceeds of theft from ones employer also committed by him the court of appeal then examined whether or not these offences which had been established and were in principle to be considered as proven could be held to be justified under article of the convention it explained that under luxembourg law the acceptance of whistleblowing as a defence derived from article of the convention had the effect of neutralising the illegal nature of the breach of the law it specified that it was the statutory element of the offence which was necessarily committed through the disclosure in good faith and in a proportionate and appropriate manner of information in the general interest which was thus neutralised and led to the defendants acquittal with regard to ep it held that he was to be recognised as enjoying the defence of having acted as a responsible journalist derived by the court from article of the convention in consequence it confirmed on this ground eps full acquittal with regard to ad and the applicant it applied the courts caselaw on the protection of whistleblowers referring in particular to guja v moldova gc no echr it reiterated that this caselaw made protection of whistleblowers subject to compliance with six conditions which it then analysed its reasoning may be summarised as follows analysis of the first four guja criteria the court of appeal noted in application of this caselaw that the revelations were in the public interest the first criterion in that they had opened the way for a public debate in europe and luxembourg about the taxation of multinational companies fiscal transparency the practice of tax rescripts and tax fairness in general it added that following the luxleaks disclosures the european commission had presented a range of measures against tax evasion and an action plan for fair and effective corporate taxation in the european union the court of appeal also held that the information disclosed had been authentic the second criterion with regard to the third criterion namely that disclosing the information to the public could only be considered as a last resort where it was clearly impracticable to do otherwise the court of appeal considered that having regard to the circumstances of the case informing the public through the media had been the only realistic alternative in order to raise the alert it accepted that the fourth criterion that of good faith had been met in the applicants case in the case of ad it held that this criterion had been complied with in the summer of when he handed over the documents which he had taken in october to ep in contrast it held that ad had not complied with this criterion when taking possession of the documents given that he had not yet intended at that point to make them public analysis of the fifth guja criterion the court of appeal then analysed the criterion which required the public interest in obtaining the information to be balanced against the harm suffered by the employer as a result of the information revealed the fifth criterion in so far as the applicant argued that pw c had not suffered any harm pointing out that the company had even announced an increase in its turnover and number of employees the court of appeal after reviewing the courts various judgments in this area noted as follows the european court does not analyse the harm sustained in specific terms but considers that the harm caused to the employer may result from damage to its image loss of confidence and in general from the impact that the report may have had on the public the higher the public profile of the case and thus of the information that the employer wished to keep secret the more the publics confidence is shaken it also stated there is accordingly no need to ascertain whether as a result of ads and the applicants disclosures pw cs turnover has decreased or whether clients have complained brought civilliability proceedings or closed their accounts with pw cthe court of appeal notes that the fact of disclosing documents subject to business and professional secrecy has certainly caused harm to pw c specifically nonpecuniary harm as a victim of criminal offences resulting from the damage to its reputation and the loss of client confidence with regard to the security procedures in place in the company furthermore and more specifically in the context of the information provided concerning the applicant it pointed out that in the present case pw c has been associated with a practice of tax evasion if not with a taxoptimisation procedure described as unacceptable it has been the victim of criminal offences and has necessarily suffered harm it went on to weigh up the public interest on the one hand against pw cs interests on the other and found with regard to ad that the public interest clearly outweighed any harm that may have been sustained by pw c and its clients it therefore held that this criterion had been complied with in respect of ad in contrast in the applicants case the court of appeal held that the disclosure of the documents had caused pw c harm that was greater than the general interest with the result that the fifth criterion had not been fulfilled it found that the defence argument that the applicant should be granted whistleblower status could not be accepted for the following reasons the documents handed over by the applicant to the journalist did not contribute to the public debate on the luxembourg practice of tax rescripts trigger a debate on tax evasion or provide essential new and previously unknown information in reaching this conclusion it relied on the following arguments in contrast to the documents disclosed by ad the documents selected by the applicant were not administrative rulings and did not illustrate the application of the tax rescripts system they were simple tax declarations that is unilateral statements by taxpayers concerning their financial situation which did not permit the tax authorities attitude towards them to be ascertained thus these documents did not reveal any information about the tax optimisation technique and were of limited relevance nor had they been selected by the applicant in order to provide additional information about the tax rescripts already in the possession of ep for example in order to illustrate how these tax rescripts were reflected in the corresponding tax declarations they had been selected solely on the basis of how wellknown the relevant taxpayer was when the applicant appropriated the documents and transmitted them to the journalist the practice of tax rescripts had already been disclosed through the documents which were transmitted by ad and publicised on the occasion of the first cash investigation programme the applicant had been aware of this circumstance thus there had been no compelling reason for the applicant to commit a fresh violation of the law by appropriating and disclosing confidential documents the documents had been used by ep to prepare as part of the second cash investigation programme a section on tax evasion and the billions we are missing rather than on the practice of tax rescripts the documents were used to illustrate tax evasion by two groups of multinational companies a and am explored in the report according to ep in the case of company a the tax declarations had allowed him to illustrate that the group had declared a significant turnover in luxembourg without however engaging in the corresponding commercial activity in that country the journalist criticised the following procedure with regard to company am he reported that this group had transferred eur million to a subsidiary governed by luxembourg law in order to repay the interest on a loan that it had granted to this subsidiary the subsidiary was able to deduct the amount in question which was then transferred to another company in the same group located in dubai where it enjoyed full tax exemption the court of appeal considered that the information in relation to the two groups of companies could admittedly be regarded as alarming and scandalous but that it did not constitute essential or fundamentally new information thus it concluded that the tax returns handed over by the applicant merely confirmed the result of the journalistic investigation carried out by eps team and that as such they were certainly useful to the journalist but did not however provide any previously unknown cardinal information capable of relaunching or contributing to the debate on tax evasion analysis of the sixth guja criterion with regard to the sixth criterion concerning the proportionality of the penalty the court of appeal made a distinction between the two defendants it held that ad who was entitled to rely on the defence of whistleblowing with regard to the offence of handing over the documents to the journalist ep in the summer of was to be absolved of any criticism with regard to those events and thus acquitted of the offence of a breach of professional secrecy with regard to those of his actions that were not covered by this defence namely those concerning the appropriation of documents in october the court of appeal reduced the prison sentence to six months suspended in its entirety and upheld the fine of eur with regard to the applicant the court of appeal held that there had been a plurality of offences so that under the domestic criminal law the most severe penalty could be doubled namely a prison term of between three months and five years and a fine of eur to noting also that the applicant could not benefit from the defence of having acted as a whistleblower it decided nonetheless to have regard as an extenuating circumstance to the motive honourable in his view which had driven him to act and to the disinterested nature of his acts in consequence it decided not to impose a prison term and to maintain the fine of eur the court of appeal upheld the civillaw judgment ordering ad and the applicant to pay the symbolic sum of one euro as compensation for the nonpecuniary damage sustained by pw c the court of cassations judgments in respect of ad and the applicant ad and the applicant appealed on points of law against the court of appeals judgment the court of cassations judgment in respect of the applicant in a judgment no criminal division of january the court of cassation dismissed the applicants appeal on points of law the applicant had submitted a legal argument alleging a violation by the court of appeal of article of the convention stating inter alia the court of appeal has misrepresented the facts and the caselaw of the european court of human rights and interpreted in a tendentious manner the limited relevance of the documents handed over to ep leading it to find that the harm suffered by the employer was greater than the general interest and to reject the defence of whistleblowing given its conclusion that the criterion of the proportionality of the harm caused in relation to the general interest was not fulfilled in the discussion of the argument the applicant had emphasised by way of example that the appendices to the tax returns filed by group a see paragraph above referred to annual general meetings which had an average duration of one minute which sufficed to demonstrate a total lack of genuine substance in luxembourg he stressed that the tax returns that he had communicated made it possible to verify the economic reality of the entity set up in luxembourg and thus to analyse the practice of using tax rescripts in response to this argument the court of cassation held inter alia assessment of the facts which must underlie a decision as to whether a defendant can benefit from the defence of whistleblower status falls within the sovereign domain of the judges invested with jurisdiction over the merits and is not subject to review by the court of cassation provided that this assessment is not deduced from reasons that are insufficient or contradictory in the present case the appellate courts based their assessment on the nature of the documents removed by the applicant the use of those documents in the context of a television programme on tax evasion the statements made by the applicant and by ep concerning the relevance of the documents in question and concluded that the tax returns removed by the applicant while they had undoubtedly been useful to the journalist ep did not however provide any cardinal information hitherto unknown that was capable of relaunching or contributing to the debate on tax evasion contrary to the applicants argument the factual findings reached by the appellate courts are not contradictory the appellate courts assessment was thus based on reasons that were adequate and free from contradiction the court of cassations judgment in respect of ad in contrast the appeal on points of law lodged by ad was granted by the court of cassation in its judgment no criminal division of january it quashed the court of appeals judgment on the grounds that whistleblower status ought in principle to be granted concerning all offences for which a person who had availed himself or herself of the right guaranteed by article of the convention was prosecuted failing which the protection that ought to arise from whistleblower status would be rendered ineffective the court of cassation thus held that the court of appeal had infringed article of the convention by refusing to allow ad to rely on the defence of whistleblowing regarding the appropriation of the documents handed over in october given that it had accepted this defence with regard to the handing over of these documents to the journalist ep in the summer of d the court of appeals remittal judgment with regard to ad in a judgment of may the court of appeal held that following the court of cassations judgment ad ought to be acquitted on the basis of article of the convention of all the offences committed with regard to the documents handed over to ep in the summer of including the offences related to the appropriation of these documents in october the court of appeal decided however that the first appellate judgment had become final and thus remained valid in respect of ad concerning these same offences in so far as they related to the internal training documents that he had also appropriated in october when appropriating the tax documents that were subsequently transmitted to ep in this connection it limited itself to suspending the pronouncement of the sentence this judgment was accepted by the parties and consequently became final relevant legal framework and practicerelevant domestic law the various offences with which the applicant was charged are provided for in the criminal code thus the provisions on theft from ones employer vol domestique read as follows article anyone who fraudulently removes an object or an electronic key that does not belong to him or her shall be guilty of theft article thefts that are not specified in this chapter shall be subject to a prison sentence of one

accomplice in the primary offence european union law directive eu on the protection of trade secrets was adopted on june under article of this directive the states are invited to include in their legislation measures procedures and remedies in order to enable trade secret owners to prevent or obtain redress for the unlawful acquisition use and disclosure of trade secrets however recital of this directive indicates that these measures procedures and remedies should not restrict whistleblowing activity it further specifies that the protection of trade secrets should not extend to cases in which disclosure of a trade secret serves the public interest insofar as directly relevant misconduct wrongdoing or illegal activity is revealed this should not be seen as preventing the competent judicial authorities from allowing an exception to the application of measures procedures and remedies in a case where the respondent had every reason to believe in good faith that his or her conduct satisfied the appropriate criteria set out in this directive directive eu on the protection of persons who report breaches of union law was subsequently adopted on october this directive which is intended to protect whistleblowers who report breaches of european union law in a range of areas such as public procurement financial services prevention of money laundering or public health is due to be transposed by the member states into their respective legal orders by december at the latest iii international materialsthe united nations in his report a of september david kaye the un special rapporteur on the promotion and the protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression addressed the protection of sources of information and of whistleblowers in his opinion the term whistleblower refers to a person who exposes information that he or she reasonably believes at the time of disclosure to be true and to constitute a threat or harm to a specified public interest such as a violation of national or international law abuse of authority waste fraud or harm to the environment public health or public safety d kaye also specified that whistleblowing does not always involve specific individual wrongdoing but it may uncover hidden information that the public has a legitimate interest in knowing on january un secretary general antónio guterres approved an updated un whistleblower protection policy with the intention of enhancing protection for individuals who report possible misconduct or cooperate with duly authorised audits or investigations the council of europe in the judgments in the cases of heinisch v germany no echr extracts and bucur and toma v romania no january the court summarised resolution on the protection of whistleblowers adopted by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on april another instrument was adopted in this area by the committee of ministers of the council of europe on april certain relevant passages from that recommendation cmrec were set out in the case of medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june this recommendation considers that a whistleblower is any person who reports or discloses information on a threat or harm to the public interest in the context of their workbased relationship whether it be in the public or private sector on june the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe adopted resolution and recommendation on improving the protection of whistleblowers in the first of these texts the parliamentary assembly referred to the disclosures concerning mass surveillance and intrusions of privacy carried out by the united states national security agency nsa and other intelligence agencies and called for the adoption of a binding legal instrument convention on whistleblower protection on the basis of committee of ministers recommendation cmrec in the second text the parliamentary assembly invited the committee of ministers to promote further improvements for the protection of whistleblowers by launching the process of negotiating a binding legal instrument in the form of a framework convention that would be open to nonmember states and cover disclosures of wrongdoings by persons employed in the field of national security and intelligence on october the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe adopted resolution and recommendation on improving the protection of whistleblowers all over europe in the first of these documents the parliament assembly strongly welcomed directive eu see paragraph above and invited the member states of the council of europe which are also members of the european union to adopt its provisions adding that there was nothing to prevent them from protecting those reporting on breaches or abuses of their national law according to the same principles as to the council of europe member states which are not members of the eu the parliamentary assembly invited them to revise their relevant legislation in this area or pass new laws that draw on the proposal for a european directive in question in the second text the parliamentary assembly reiterated its invitation to the committee of ministers to begin preparations for negotiating a binding legal instrument in the form of a council of europe convention which should draw on the abovementioned european directive taking due account of the clarifications and additions proposed in resolution in its reply adopted on april the committee of minsters reiterated with regard to the assemblys recommendation that a legally binding instrument be drawn up the position set out in its reply to assembly recommendation it considered that given the complexity of the subject and the range of solutions adopted by the member states to protect whistleblowers the negotiation of a binding instrument such as a convention would be time consuming and there would be no certainty as to its outcome and that it was at this stage more appropriate to encourage states fully to implement the recommendations which have been adopted by the committee of ministers or other bodies the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant alleged that his conviction following his disclosure to a journalist of sixteen documents emanating from his employer pw c had amounted to disproportionate interference with his right to freedom of expression he relied on article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the government raised an objection of inadmissibility arguing that the application was manifestly illfounded they rejected the applicants claim that among other points the court of appeal had ruled that it was possible to circumvent the courts caselaw regarding violations of article of the convention and had merely pretended to weigh up the interests referring to certain passages in the impugned judgment the government explained that the court of appeal had reiterated that it was obliged to give full effect to convention and had then applied the courts caselaw they considered the applicants assertion to be manifestly erroneous and invited the court to declare the application inadmissible in application of article a of the convention the applicant submitted in reply that through this argument the government analysed in detail the weighing up of interests conducted by the domestic courts a matter which went to the merits of the case he added that the government while recognising the existence of interference with the right protected by article of the convention see paragraph below could not then contradict themselves by raising an objection arguing that the complaint which moreover they recognised as being wellfounded in part was manifestly illfounded he therefore asked that the objection raised by the government be joined to the merits of the case and then be rejected the court considers that the argument in question raises questions which require examination on the merits of the complaint under article of the convention rather than an examination of the admissibility of the complaint see mutatis mutandis gürbüz and bayar v turkey no july the court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds the court therefore declares it admissible merits the parties submissionsa the applicant the applicant who had indicated in his application that he was at the origin of the luxleaks case took note of the governments acknowledgment that there had been an interference with his right to freedom of expression he considered that the legal question centred on the proportionality of the interference he submitted firstly that the government were attempting to carry out an innocent and objective transformation of the facts when asserting that the tax returns handed over by the applicant were mere statements by the taxpayer the applicant submitted that these were on the contrary legal documents drawn up and drafted by pw c on behalf of its clients and invoiced to them which demonstrated the concrete existence of the tax arrangement contained in the tax rescript the creation of luxembourg and offshore companies movement of capital inside groups payment of dividends etc he also made various allegations and criticisms with regard to the court of appeals judgment in his submission the court of appeal had held that neither the convention nor luxembourg law provided for an exemption from criminal prosecution for whistleblowers with the result that article allowed only for a finding that prosecution was not necessary in a democratic society without allowing the accused to be acquitted relaxer in luxembourg law by holding that the public interest in learning the information handed over by him was weaker than the damage caused to pw c the court of appeal and this finding had been endorsed by the court of cassation had denied him the protection of whistleblower status since the court of appeal had judged that the compensation to be paid to the employer was a symbolic euro the balancing exercise thus presupposed that the public interest in knowing the information in question was in this case less than one symbolic euro that is equal to zero however as the court of appeal had not claimed that the value of the information provided by the applicant was nonexistent it had only pretended to balance the interests the domestic courts had noted that there was indeed a defence ground in the present case which could have led to the applicants acquittal but having regard to the circumstances they decided that the applicant could rely only on a lesser protection that of an acknowledgement of extenuating circumstances there had been no objective reason to distinguish ads treatment from his in that they had both been employees and had been equally linked to the document leaks which resulted in the luxleaks scandals the information revealed by him had strengthened ads position submitting that his criminal conviction could have been motivated by only one concern its deterrent function he considered that the existence of this penalty was in itself sufficient to justify the finding of a violation of article of the convention lastly he reiterated and endorsed the thirdpartys observations which could be summarised as follows accepting the three new criteria of essential new and previously unknown information as the court of appeal had done see paragraph above would have serious repercussions on the effectiveness of the protection afforded to whistleblowers firstly the addition of such criteria would result in legal uncertainty thus the criterion of the essential nature of the information disclosed would introduce legal vagueness since this concept was insufficiently precise furthermore it would be difficult for the courts to apply this criterion which was unprecedented and absent from any of the laws or caselaw in the states which protected whistleblowers it would give rise to a range of interpretations the criterion of new information would result in a reduction in the number of alerts particularly where an alert concerned information relating to facts that were already known but had not been addressed in the past the french case of céline boussié who had raised the alert in about abuse of children with disabilities which was already known and had been denounced by her former colleagues since the late s was one example lastly with regard to the criterion of previously unknown information it might be necessary in a democratic society for the disclosure of additional evidence unknown but helping to draw attention to facts that were previously known and had been denounced to constitute an ethical warning that deserved protection under article of the convention secondly it would be impossible in practice for whistleblowers to fulfil these new criteria the six criteria adopted by the court none of which referred to assessment of the new essential or previously unknown nature of the relevant information had enabled a satisfactory balance to be struck between the interests of employers and the publics right to information this approach by the court was compatible with the existing international standards and in particular with the european directive adopted in this area which as a general rule required only a reasonable belief in the accuracy of what was being complained about excluding any prior assessment of whether the information was new previously unknown or essential moreover this approach was appropriate in terms of the profiles of whistleblowers who in a world of digital networks had extremely easy access to a very large amount of information in this context the model of the guja caselaw was a safeguard against illegal leaks in that it made it possible to guarantee that the information disclosed was genuinely in the public interest however if whistleblowers were persuaded that they could no longer be protected they would be encouraged to leak information anonymously furthermore the new criteria used by the court of appeal would as an indirect effect weaken the states obligation to investigate violations of human rights the public authorities would thus be relieved of their responsibility to conduct investigations into the facts disclosed by whistleblowers and to decide on whether or not it was appropriate to prosecute the presumed offenders where an alert was raised long before the harm emerged and whistleblowers were therefore unable to ground their allegations on a sufficient factual basis only an investigation by the public authorities would allow for the entire problem to which the whistleblower had only partial access to be brought to light examples from the courts caselaw showed that protection had been granted to whistleblowers who had disclosed without necessarily being able to adduce conclusive proof information drawing attention to the existence of environmental damage breaches of the physical integrity of individuals or violations of the rights which contributed to the pluralism typifying societies lastly over and above these problems the new criteria used by the court of appeal would also lead to an interference with the rights of journalists and watchdogs of democracy whistleblowers were already hesitant to alert the public on account of the possible severe consequences for their personal situation the adoption of the abovementioned criteria would have an additional dissuasive effect on journalists potential whistleblowing sources the publicwatchdog role of the media could thus be undermined in many cases the right of journalists to protect their sources was closely linked to the need to protect the disclosure of information by whistleblowers in conclusion requiring that the information handed over by whistleblowers to the press be essential new and previously unknown and denying protection in that connection would necessarily undermine the protection of sources and could deter whistleblowers from working with journalistsb the government the government disputed the applicants allegation that he had been at the origin of the luxleaks case according to the government it was ad who had been the source of the disclosures both in chronological perspective terms and with regard to the number and nature of the documents disclosed ads revelations had illustrated how the tax authorities had dealt with the companies concerned while in contrast those of the applicant had merely been straightforward unilateral tax returns which had not shed light on the practice of tax rescripts it was the qualitative difference between the documents handed over by ad and those transmitted by the applicant which explained why the former had been acquitted while the latter had merely been granted the benefit of extenuating circumstances however the government acknowledged that given that the applicant had been punished by the criminal and civil courts for having handed over documents to a journalist who subsequently published them there had been an interference with his right to freedom of expression they noted that the applicant referred only to the issue of the proportionality of the interference and thus did not question the fact that it had been prescribed by law and that it pursued a legitimate aim with regard to issue of proportionality the government considered that the court of appeal had scrupulously analysed the six criteria laid down in the courts caselaw in this aera as they applied to the applicant they stated that the courts assessment could concern only criteria and the only ones in respect of which the applicant challenged the merits of the court of appeals analysis the government began by rejecting the applicants assertions that they had transformed the facts pointing out that they had confined themselves to summarising faithfully what they considered to be the relevant findings by the domestic courts they also considered it their duty to address the criticisms made by the applicant of the court of appeals judgment see paragraph above thus the applicant had reached his conclusion regarding the failure to acquit him from a citation taken out of context of a passage in the court of appeals judgment without having regard to the subsequent reasoning the government pointed out that according to the court of appeal even in the absence of a special express and formal legal provision an acquittal could be based on a defence ground sui generis and where a criminal conviction was in breach of the protection granted by the court under article of the convention the whistleblower could benefit from this ground which had the effect of neutralising the unlawfulness of the breach of the law and would result in a defendants acquittal the applicant had not been denied any protection under article of the convention in that the court of appeal had had regard in imposing the sentence to the applicants motives and to the disinterested nature of his actions which had been recognised as extenuating circumstances nor had the judges merely pretended to assess his case as the applicant claimed the court of appeal in awarding one symbolic euro in respect of the nonpecuniary damage sustained by the civil party had not held that the damage sustained by it was limited to one euro in the civil proceedings pw c had for its own reasons chosen not to claim compensation for pecuniary damage or to attempt to assess the real value of the nonpecuniary damage since under domestic law the court of appeal could not award a sum greater than that claimed it had thus confined itself to assessing whether the civil party had sustained nonpecuniary damage at least equivalent to the amount claimed on the other hand it had given a detailed ruling on the damage suffered by pw c when in full compliance with the courts caselaw it had assessed the criterion of how the interests at stake were weighed up in so far as the applicant alleged that he had been afforded only lesser protection see paragraph above the government replied that contrary to the applicants assertions the court of appeal had not found that the circumstances were such as to enable him to rely on the protection of article of the convention but on the contrary had found that the applicant was not entitled to benefit from the defence of whistleblowing see paragraph above with regard to the fifth criterion the court of appeal had found giving relevant reasons that real and definite harm had been sustained and had then weighed this against the public interest in being informed of the content of the documents disclosed by the applicant the court of appeal had carried out a detailed analysis of the evidence holding that the applicants disclosure of the documents had served neither to supplement ads prior revelations about luxembourgs administrative practice of tax rescripts nor to demonstrate it the government also submitted that the relevance of the documents disclosed by the applicant had been limited to enabling the journalist ep to illustrate a report describing the fact which was neither new nor original that in order to limit their tax burden groups of multinational companies were taking advantage of the lack of international harmonisation in the area of tax legislation thus contrary to the disclosures made by ad the documents handed over by the applicant had served only to illustrate the fact wellknown and in itself unexceptional that companies in order to reduce their tax burden structured their assets by creating subsidiaries but were not relevant to establish or illustrate that the use of these structures had been approved in advance by the authorities or to understand the scale scope and systematic nature of the tax optimisation techniques approved in advance by the authorities in the context of the tax rescripts revealed by luxleaks as to the sixth criterion the proportionality of the penalty and its dissuasive effect had to be assessed in relation to an individual who did not meet all the criteria for whistleblower status as the court of appeal had found that the fifth criterion was not met in the applicants case his situation was different from that of individuals who met all the criteria for being regarded as whistleblowers the court of appeal had found that the applicant was entitled to protection under article of the convention although he could not rely on the defence of whistleblowing thus in application of the courts caselaw the court of appeal had applied a lower level of protection by enabling the applicant to benefit from extenuating circumstances in imposing a sentence that was limited to a relatively low fine the court of appeal had taken into consideration his motives and the disinterested nature of his action the government concluded that in the particular circumstances of the case the fine could not be considered as either disproportionate nor as having a dissuasive effect on the exercise of the applicants freedom of expression or that of other employeesc the thirdparty intervener the association maison des lanceurs dalerte in its capacity as a thirdparty intervener stressed the serious interest of the present case since it required the court to rule on the methods of assessing the proportionality of interference with the freedom of expression of whistleblowers through a representative sample of the legal systems which have put in place legislation to protect whistleblowers it set out the definitions adopted in this area in the relevant texts referring to the courts caselaw it emphasised that the only criteria taken into consideration by the court had never required an assessment of the essential new and previously unknown nature of the information as had occurred in the present case the courts assessmenta the appliable principles the fundamental principles concerning the question of whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the courts caselaw and have been summarised as follows see among other authorities magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no november i freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society as set forth in article this freedom is subject to exceptions which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article iii the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts more specifically in the context of the signalling by employees of illegal conduct or wrongdoing observed by them in the workplace the court has identified certain fundamental principles underlying the assessment of whether an interference with the right to freedom of expression was proportionate thus the court must have regard to several factors namely the public interest in the disclosed information its authenticity the availability of alternative channels for making the disclosure the employees good faith the damage to the employer and the severity of the penalty see guja v moldova gc no echr heinisch cited above and bucur and toma cited above and b application of the abovementioned principles to the present casei whether there has been an interference it is not disputed between the parties that the applicants conviction for having transmitted confidential document to a journalist who had then published them constituted an interference in the exercise of his freedom of expression reiterating that article applies to the workplace in general including when the relations between employer and employee are governed by private law see heinisch cited above and the caselaw cited therein the court considers that the applicants conviction amounted to an interference within the meaning of article ii whether the interference was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim the court notes that it is not in dispute that the interference was prescribed by law and that it pursued a legitimate aim specifically the applicant was convicted for having committed various offences provided for in the criminal code see paragraph above and the purpose of prosecuting and punishing these offences was to prevent the disclosure of confidential information and to protect the reputation of his employer pw c it thus remains to be ascertained whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society in particular whether there was a proportionate relationship between the interference and the aim pursuediii whether the interference was necessaryα characterisation of whistleblower at the outset and before analysing whether the interference was necessary the court considers it useful to decide whether the applicant could be described as a whistleblower under the criteria established in its relevant caselaw in the various cases that it has examined in this area the court has either explicitly framed the debate in terms of the freedom of expression of whistleblowers and concluded that the principles set out in the guja judgment were applicable see heinisch cited above or it has ruled that the protection of whistleblowers was not in issue see for example rubins v latvia no january or aurelian oprea v romania no january in the present case the court of appeal explained that under luxembourg law the acceptance of whistleblowing as a defence derived from article of the convention had the effect of neutralising the illegal nature of the breach of the law it also specified that in such cases it was the statutory element of the offence which had to have been committed through the disclosure in good faith and in a proportionate and appropriate manner of information of general interest which was thus neutralised leading to a defendants acquittal see paragraph above in the applicants case it had found that he could not rely on the defence of whistleblowing as defined in domestic law see paragraph above the court considers that it is not its task to express a view as to whether or not the statutory element of the offence of which the applicant was accused should be neutralised as this is a matter for domestic law alone to that end it finds that it is unnecessary to study the related arguments submitted by the applicant and contested by the government see paragraphs and above however it considers that in order to examine the complaint under article of the convention that has been submitted to it it must assess whether this was a whistleblowing case in which the principles established in that regard were applicable in this connection it points out firstly that there was a hierarchical bond between the applicant and his employer pw c which entailed a duty of loyalty reserve and discretion on his part that duty was a particular feature of the concept of whistleblowing see a contrario medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above secondly it points out that the applicant had contacted a journalist in order to disclose confidential information obtained in the context of his employment relationship taking the view that parallels can be drawn between the applicants actions and those of the applicants in the abovecited cases of guja and heinisch the court finds that the applicant should be regarded in principle as a whistleblower for the purposes of the courts caselaw in consequence it must review whether the various criteria established in the guja caselaw have been complied withβ compliance with the criteria established by the guja caselaw the court notes that there is no dispute between the parties with regard to the first four criteria established by the guja line of caselaw the only disagreement concerns the fifth and sixth criteria as regards the fifth criterion as regards the fifth criterion the court notes that the applicants right to protection of his freedom of expression is in conflict with the right of his employer pw c to protection of its reputation as the present application requires an examination of the fair balance that has to be struck between these competing interests the court will have regard to the following factors firstly where the national authorities have weighed up the interests at stake in compliance with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw strong reasons are required if it is to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr as regards the assessment in the context of the balancing exercise between the respective interests of the harm sustained by the employer the court has reiterated that there is an interest in protecting the commercial success and viability of companies for the benefit of shareholders and employees but also for the wider economic good see heinisch cited above however with more particular regard to the reputation of a company the court has also been careful to state that there is a difference between the reputation of an individual concerning social status which might have repercussions on his or her dignity and the commercial reputational interests of a company which are devoid of that moral dimension see uj v hungary no july in the present case the domestic courts held that the fifth criterion of the guja caselaw was not satisfied since the disclosure by the applicant of documents that were subject to professional secrecy had caused harm to pw c resulting in particular from the damage to the firms reputation and the loss of client confidence in its internal security arrangements that outweighed the general interest see paragraphs and above in balancing the interests at stake the courts thus attributed greater weight to the harm suffered by pw c than to the interest of the disclosures made by the applicant the court must dismiss at the outset the applicants argument that the court of appeal merely pretended to weigh up the interests at stake see paragraph above in this connection it refers and subscribes to the exhaustive and convincing explanations provided by the government see paragraph above the court of appeal did indeed assess the nonpecuniary damage sustained by pw c before weighing up the respective interests however under domestic law the court of appeal could not award compensation in excess of the amount claimed by the civil party in fact it is common practice in luxembourg for individuals or entities which have sustained nonpecuniary damage including substantial damage to waive the right to corresponding monetary compensation thus a civil party will frequently simply seek recognition of the damage sustained as such which entails requesting a symbolic award of one euro nonetheless the harm could not be regarded as nonexistent simply because pw c had assessed it at one euro previously the symbolic sum of one franc worth forty times less in consequence the court sees no inherent contradiction in the fact that the court of appeal established on the one hand that damage had been sustained and on the other hand fixed the symbolic amount of that damage at one euro it is undeniable that pw c suffered harm owing to the very fact of the widely reported controversy arising out of the luxleaks case see mutatis mutandis heinisch cited above furthermore the press coverage confirms that the company experienced a difficult year after the situation came to light see paragraph in fine above however again according to the media and this has not been disputed once the initial difficult period had passed pw c saw an increase in turnover coupled with a significant increase in staff numbers see paragraph in fine above this is a fact that the court can not disregard in the context of the present case particularly in the light of distinction made by it in the abovecited uj judgment hence it must be ascertained whether the damage to the companys reputation was ultimately real and tangible however given the increase in its turnover at least once the first difficult year had passed pw cs financial fortunes do not appear to have suffered lasting harm and there is every indication that its reputation was not definitively compromised at least not among the companies that make up its client base the court concludes from this that while pw c undoubtedly suffered harm in the short term no longerterm damage to its reputation has been established in order to continue its examination of how the respective interests were weighed up the court must now address the grounds adduced by the domestic authorities as regards the interest of the revelations made by the applicant in this connection the court of appeals reasoning which is central to the issue is as follows the documents handed over by the applicant to the journalist did not contribute to the public debate on the luxembourg practice of tax rescripts or trigger a debate on tax evasion or provide essential new and previously unknown information see paragraph above in reasoning in this way the court of appeal took account of a number of factors in particular it noted that that the applicants disclosures related solely to companies tax returns which did not enable any conclusions to be drawn as to the tax authorities attitude towards those companies it considered that there was no compelling reason for the applicant to disclose the confidential documents in question at a time when the practice of tax rescripts had already been revealed by ad it specified that the documents disclosed by the applicant which had been used to illustrate the premise that tax evasion was being practiced by two groups of multinational companies were certainly useful to the journalist but did not provide any essential previously unknown information capable of relaunching or contributing to the debate on tax evasion see paragraphs to above in taking that approach the court of appeal gave a detailed explanation for its reasoning as to the fifth criterion established by the guja caselaw accordingly the court would require strong reasons to substitute its own view for that of the domestic courts see von hannover no cited above however that situation did not apply in the present case for the following reasons the court of appeal carefully assessed the interest of the applicants disclosures carrying out a thorough examination of their content and their repercussions for the issue of multinational companies tax practices in this context it acknowledged that the disclosures were of general interest see paragraph above it even took into consideration the impact of the information accepting that it was liable to concern and shock people see paragraph above nonetheless it held that the interest of the applicants disclosures weighed less heavily than the harm suffered by pw c after finding that those disclosures were of limited relevance in reaching that conclusion it noted that the documents did not provide any information that was essential new or previously unknown the court can not subscribe to the applicants view that in so doing the court of appeal added new criteria to those established by the courts caselaw on the contrary it considers that the three qualifying criteria information that is essential new and previously unknown are absorbed in the court of appeals exhaustive reasoning on the fifth criterion concerning the balancing of the private and public interests at stake in the courts opinion these terms should be considered as clarifications which in other circumstances might be considered too narrow but which in the present case served together with the other elements taken into account by the court of appeal to found the conclusion that the applicants disclosures lacked sufficient interest to counterbalance the harm suffered by pw c the court considers that the court of appeal confined itself to examining the evidence carefully in the light of the criteria established by the courts caselaw in this area before concluding that the documents disclosed by the applicant were not of sufficient interest to justify acquitting him moreover the fact that in contrast ad was acquitted in application of the same criteria in the courts caselaw confirms that the national authorities carried out a detailed examination in weighing up the respective interests as regards the sixth criterion in assessing the proportionality of an interference with freedom of expression the court has held that the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are factors to be taken into account see otegi mondragon v spain no echr in the present case the court notes that the domestic courts took into consideration as a mitigating circumstance the disinterested nature of the applicants actions and therefore imposed only a relatively modest fine see paragraph above the court concludes that such a penalty can reasonably be regarded as a relatively mild one which does not have a genuinely chilling effect on the exercise of the applicants freedom or that of other employees but encourages those concerned to reflect on the legitimacy of the action being envisaged c conclusion regard being had to the contracting states margin of appreciation in this sphere the court concludes that the domestic courts struck a fair balance in the present case between on the one hand the need to protect the rights of the applicants employer and on the other the need to protect the applicants freedom of expression accordingly there has been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the courtdeclares unanimously the complaint concerning article of the convention admissible holds by five votes to two that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on may pursuant to rule and of the rules of courtnature_p_ signature_p_ milan blaško paul lemmens registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the separate opinion of judges lemmens and pavli is annexed to this judgment plmb joint dissenting opinion of judges lemmens and pavli we regret that we can not agree with the majoritys finding that there has been no violation of the applicants article rights in this case our disagreement relates both to the general approach adopted by the majority in weighing the private employers rights visàvis the public interest in the disclosure of the relevant material and to the reasons provided by the national courts in concluding that the employers interests ought to prevail under the circumstances in particular we are of the opinion that the considerations relied upon by the national courts in their assessment of what is called the fifth criterion identified in guja v moldova gc no echr namely the criterion requiring a balancing of the public interest in obtaining the information and the harm caused by the disclosure to the employer see guja cited above and see also paragraphs of the present judgment are at odds with basic notions of publicpolicy discourse in a democratic society regretfully therefore we are unable to agree with the majoritys acceptance of that reasoning see paragraphs the outcome of the balancing exercise performed by the national courts was based on the supposedly limited contribution of the applicants disclosures to public debate as compared in particular with the initial set of revelations made by another employee of the company concerned the key argument in this respect was that the documents disclosed by the applicant did not bring to light any essential new and previously unknown information see paragraph of the present judgment based on that assessment the national courts held that the harm suffered by the applicants employer outweighed the general interest in receiving the disclosed information ibid the nature of the applicants disclosures we recall that the applicants disclosures consisted of sixteen documents including fourteen tax returns by multinational corporations and two cover letters some of which were used to prepare an episode of the investigative television programme cash investigation broadcast on june see paragraph of the present judgment according to the investigative journalist in charge of that programme the applicants revelations served as the principal basis for that episode the journalist also noted that certain disclosures made during that episode would have been impossible without access to the information revealed by the applicant the documents handed over by the applicant together with documents obtained as part of the initial disclosure by a different whistleblower were subsequently published on and november by the international consortium of investigative journalists ibid it is clear from the case file that the applicant put forward compelling arguments before the national courts some of them mentioned in paragraph of the judgment as to why the tax returns disclosed and in particular the annexes thereto were important for verifying substantiating and building upon the documents disclosed in the initial set of revelations these arguments were also endorsed by the investigative journalist concerned who was well placed to assess the importance of the applicants disclosure for the ongoing public debate on the matter the two sets of disclosures appear therefore to have been closely connected it is not in dispute that the applicants disclosure was in the public interest see paragraph of the present judgment the national courts recognised that the disclosed material facilitated a public debate in luxembourg and indeed at the european level regarding the taxation of multinational companies tax transparency the practice of socalled tax rulings and fair taxation in general see paragraph for the national courts the decisive question was how much was it in the public interest as will be explained below we do not think that this is the correct way to pose the question under article see in particular paragraph below the weight to be attached to the interests of a private employer in whistleblower disputes it is settled caselaw that there is little scope under article of the convention for restrictions on debate on questions of public interest see sürek v turkey no gc no echr iv and guja cited above exceptions to the general principles established in article must be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly see hertel v switzerland august reports vi steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii and guja cited above in determining the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression of an employee making a disclosure on publicinterest grounds the court must under the socalled fifth guja criterion weigh the damage if any suffered by his or her employer as a result of the disclosure and assess whether such damage outweighed the interest of the public in having the information revealed see guja cited above in contrast to the present case the balancing exercise carried out in guja which involved disclosures made by a senior prosecutor was between two public interests on the one hand the interest in informing the public about undue pressures and wrongdoing within a public prosecutors office and on the other the interest in maintaining public confidence in that body in heinisch v germany no echr extracts which involved a publiclyowned healthcare provider the court recognised that the balancing exercise can also involve the private interest in protecting the commercial success and viability of companies for the benefit of their shareholders and employees but also for the wider economic good conversely the court highlighted the public interest in running public companies that meet proper service standards as an argument in favour of the disclosures the fifth guja criterion must be interpreted and applied in line with the overarching principles referred to in paragraph above as the court has noted specifically in connection with the application of that criterion open discussion of topics of public concern is essential to democracy and regard must be had to the great importance of not discouraging members of the public from voicing their opinions on such matters see guja cited above in our view it follows from these considerations that once it is established as it has been in the present case that the information disclosed by the employee was a matter of public interest the disclosure in question must be presumed to be protected under article of the convention for this presumption to be rebutted under the fifth guja criterion the employer and in criminal proceedings the prosecution should be required to present compelling reasons based on concrete and significant harm to the private interests concerned for establishing that these interests clearly outweighed the value of disclosure a less protective approach would result in considerable legal uncertainty and be likely to deter any future employees from making such disclosures which would be at odds with the fundamental principles guiding the application of the guja criteria furthermore the weighing of the competing interests under the fifth guja criterion should not be made in isolation but in the light of the global article analysis encompassing all the relevant criteria in other words the guja criteria are not to be viewed as mere boxes to be checked but as principles guiding a comprehensive review by the national courts conversely this does not mean that unmeritorious disclosures made with little concern for the public interest andor causing considerable harm to legitimate private interests should prevail the proposed approach is also supported by recent international developments regarding the protection of whistleblowers which have recognised the need for strengthened protection in both the public and private spheres see paragraphs of the judgment notably eu directive on the protection of persons who report breaches of union law see paragraph of the judgment does not make the protection of whistleblowers conditional on any considerations related to the harm caused to the employer as long as the general conditions for protection under article of the directive are met in the light of the above factors we consider that the court should have looked more closely at the manner in which the national courts weighed up the competing interests at issue in the present case in particular the considerations stemming from the guja and heinisch line of caselaw have been applied in the present case the first whistleblower case to our knowledge to involve a purely private employer without due regard for the fundamental principles of article in particular the national decisions were based on the isolated finding of a failure to meet the fifth criterion without assessing the role of that factor in the global analysis and without identifying any compelling private interests against a disclosure deemed to be generally in the public interest the requirement of essential new and previously unknown information finally and most importantly we take issue with the national courts reliance within their assessment of the fifth guja criterion on the purported lack of essential new and previously unknown information in the applicants disclosures see paragraph above in our view such an approach does not find support in this courts caselaw see paragraph below rests on a misguided notion of how public debate works see paragraph below is likely to produce significant chilling effects see paragraph below and is questionable on the facts of the case see paragraph below the national courts treatment of the applicants followup disclosure does not sit well with the courts general and one might add commonsensical view that the fact that a public debate on a certain matter is ongoing speaks in favour of further disclosures of information which develop that debate see for example dammann v switzerland no april and colaço mestre and sic sociedade independente de comunicação sa v portugal nos and april furthermore the distinction made by the national courts between the first and second set of revelations seems to rest on the notion that once a public debate is opened by certain information being disclosed the public interest in receiving information that confirms complements or reinforces the initial information is significantly reduced even if we were to accept the view that the facts disclosed by the current applicant were qualitatively less novel general tax avoidance by corporations rather than government malfeasance as such we find it hard to come to terms with a view of public debate that is instantaneous or frozen in time the publics attitudes towards issues of public interest can change constantly in some cases decades of argument and counterargument may be needed before any meaningful change in public or private conduct is achieved in addition with regard to the subjectmatter of the revelations made by the applicant in the present case the intricacies of corporate tax policies are hardly the most accessible topic for the general public the national courts appear to have underestimated the great illustrative strength that lies in disclosures of the kind made by the applicant yes the general contours of a perceived problem may be widely known but there is still great value in sketching out its precise dimensions and manifestations one may be well aware for example of the problem of police violence but the impact of a specific episode of excessive force captured on video can nevertheless be transformational the approach taken by the national courts and endorsed by the majority is capable of creating significant chilling effects for future whistleblower disclosures in the private sector this is because an individual who is considering disclosing information that he or she believes to be in the public interest may face great uncertainty in assessing whether that information will be deemed to meet the much higher standard of essential new and previously unknown data in this respect it is generally recognised that the scope of protected disclosures should be easily understandable by potential whistleblowers and that the protection of whistleblowers should not be subject to subjective and unpredictable conditions without any clear and precise indication of what is expected of the potential whistleblower the approach taken by the national courts is at odds with these requirements finally the harm caused to the employers interests in the present case was negligible in the long term as expressly recognised by the majority see paragraph of the judgment as such the applicants disclosures must have been considered of such low article value that they had to give way even to less than significant harm on the other side of the scales while we appreciate the need for some deterrence against potentially unjustified and repeated disclosures about the luxembourg financial market we find that the factual assessment made by the national courts in this case is far from convincing see paragraph above in conclusion the balance struck by the majority between the public interest in whistleblower disclosures and the privatesector interests in secrecy is in tension with the guja line of this courts caselaw as well as with emerging european standards in this area in our humble view it creates obstacles to effective protection for whistleblowing in the private sector see

after lt left as he subsequently confirmed when he was interviewed by the gendarmes on october lt wrote to the nîmes public prosecutor to lodge a criminal complaint against the applicant sb and lr on account of the offending comments posted on the applicants facebook page with her letter she attached screen shots as evidence of the offending comments on october the applicant posted a message on the wall of his facebook account asking users to be careful with the content of their comments but did not do anything about the comments already posted lt was interviewed by the gendarmes on december she stated that she had discovered the comments on october when she was in the office of her partner an mep and first deputy to the mayor of nîmes she explained that their relationship was public knowledge and that the racist comments on the applicants publicly accessible facebook page included one associating her north africansounding forename with that of her partner and his policies she stated that after she had discovered the posts she had immediately gone to the hairdressing salon run by sb to express her indignation according to her sb had been very surprised and had clearly not been aware of the public nature of this facebook page but he had confirmed he was talking about her when he said thanks f and kisses to l she added that she had then been accompanied to the town hall by the prefects wife who was just passing by and who had seen how annoyed she was on the way there she had logged onto facebook again to find that sbs comment had already been removed the investigation into the applicants facebook account revealed on the same day that the comments by lr were still there while those posted by sb had indeed disappeared for his part lr was identified as being an employee of nîmes town council when interviewed by the gendarmes on january he explained that he worked as an assistant in the applicants election campaign and denied that his comments had been racist or an incitement to racial hatred explaining that he had never intended to direct his comments against lt he explained that in the meantime he had deleted the comments in which fp could have recognised himself or have been recognised by others during his interview of january sb told the gendarmes that he had been unaware that the applicants facebook page was publicly accessible and had deleted his comments immediately after lt had come to see him at his hairdressing salon he added that he had informed the applicant later that day of his altercation with lt on january the applicant was also interviewed by the investigators recalling that he had been a candidate in nîmes standing against fp lts partner he explained that he had been unable to monitor the large number of comments posted each week on the wall of his facebook account he indicated in particular that he had not written the impugned comments himself he had not had the time to delete the comment by sb who had already done so he had only become aware of lrs comments when he was summoned to the gendarmerie and he was prepared to delete them if the courts so requested he consulted his facebook wall every day but did not often read the comments which were too numerous given that he had more than friends who could post comments hours a day and that he preferred to post content to inform his readers lt whom he knew only by her partners surname had not been mentioned by name and he had not been aware of her forename until she filed a complaint lt had once personally taken him to task at a polling station she should have telephoned him to ask him to delete these comments which would have obviated the need for a criminal complaint but her aim had clearly been to destabilise his candidature as he was standing against her partner instead lt had gone to the hairdressing salon of sb whom she knew to insult and threaten him in front of witnesses lastly he knew lr and sb activists in his party who did not hold any office in it referring to his foreign origins he added that he had never displayed any racism or discrimination against anyone and that he did not perceive any call to murder or violence in the disputed remarks which he considered to be within the limits of any citizens freedom of expression he emphasised that he had removed public access to his facebook wall a few days before this interview in order to limit access only to those who chose to be his friends and to avoid any further incidents that were not of his making after the interview the investigators were able to confirm that the applicants facebook page was indeed no longer accessible to the public the applicant together with sb and lr were summoned to appear before nîmes criminal court in connection with the publication of the comments in question on the wall of his facebook account to answer charges of incitement to hatred or violence against a group and in particular lt on account of their origin or the fact of belonging or not belonging to a specific ethnicity nation race or religion the summons referred to section first paragraph section eighth paragraph and section of the law of july and section of law no of july in a judgment of february the nîmes criminal court found the applicant sb and lr guilty as charged and ordered each of them to pay a fine of euros eur the applicant was convicted under section first paragraph and section eighth paragraph of the law of july and section of law no of july sb and the applicant were also ordered jointly to pay eur to lt as civil party in compensation for nonpecuniary damage however the court did not see fit to order the sanction of electoral disqualification that had been called for by the public prosecutor in its judgment the court began by finding that the various offending comments had specifically defined the group concerned namely muslims to equate that group with drug dealers and prostitutes who reign supreme riff raff who sell drugs all day long or those responsible for throwing stones at cars belonging to white people was clearly likely on account of both the meaning and scope of the comments to arouse a strong feeling of rejection or hostility towards people who belonged or were assumed to belong to the muslim community it further took the view that lt could be regarded as having been provoked by the impugned comments in view of the references to her partner and the wording thanks f and kisses to l which had had the effect of portraying them both as being responsible for the alleged transformation of nîmes into algiers and to arouse hatred or violence against them as regards the applicant the court observed that it could be inferred from section of the law of july as interpreted by the constitutional council in its decision of september that the criminal liability of the producer of a website intended for communication to the general public including access to messages posted by its users would only be engaged in respect of such messages if it could be established that the producer had been aware of their content before they were posted or if not if he or she failed to act promptly to delete the messages at issue upon becoming aware of them it dismissed the applicants arguments according to which he had not had time to read the comments and that he had not been aware of the comments by sb and lr on the grounds that first comments could only be posted on his wall after he had given access to his friends of which there were at october and that he was responsible for checking the content of the posts second he must have been aware that his page was likely to attract comments with a political and thus essential polemical content and that he should have been all the more careful to monitor them the court concluded that having set up an electronic public communication service on his own initiative for the purpose of exchanging opinions and having left the offending comments which had remained visible as of december according to the investigators the applicant had failed to act promptly to put an end to their dissemination and was therefore guilty in his capacity as principal the applicant and sb appealed sb subsequently withdrew his appeal in a judgment of october the nîmes court of appeal upheld the applicants conviction reducing the fine to eur it further ordered him to pay lt eur in costs for the appeal proceedings in its reasoning the court of appeal held that the criminal court had been correct in finding that the comments clearly defined the group of people concerned namely muslims and that to associate the muslim community with crime and insecurity in the city of nîmes was likely to arouse a strong feeling of rejection or hostility towards that group noting that the legislation cited in the proceedings concerned discrimination against a person or group of persons it found as follows the expression kisses to leila referring to lt and her connection with fp deputy mayor of nîmes who is described in the posts as having contributed to the abandonment of the town of nîmes to the muslims and thus to insecurity is such as to associate her with the transformation of the town and thus to arouse hatred or violence against her on the basis of these elements the two posts in question constitute incitement to hatred or violence against a person namely fps partner lt on account of a presumption because of her forename that she belonged to a muslim community referring further to the provisions of section of the law of july and to the facts of the case the court of appeal noted that there was no evidence that the applicant had been informed of the content of the comments before they were posted but that in his capacity as an elected member of the front national and a public figure he had knowingly made his facebook wall public and had therefore authorised his friends to post comments on it the court continued its reasoning as follows by thus acting voluntarily he became responsible for the content of the comments posted his status as a political figure required him to be all the more vigilant he can not claim not to have been aware of the comments posted on his website on october especially as he stated during the investigation that he consulted it every day he did not however remove the comments which were subsequently deleted by s b himself alerted by the latter to the reaction of the civil party he did not delete lrs comment either and the latter was still present on his website when consulted by the investigators on december he can not be regarded as the court below rightly found as having promptly put an end to the dissemination of the offending comments he legitimised his position by explaining that such comments appeared to him to be compatible with freedom of expression the fact they were left on his wall was thus deliberate on his part in the light of these elements the court below was right to find the defendant guilty as charged and the judgment is upheld in respect of his conviction the applicant appealed to the court of cassation relying in particular on article of the convention in a single ground of appeal he argued that for the offence to be made out the comments had to contain encouragement or incitement to discrimination hatred or violence and not merely give rise to a strong feeling of rejection or hostility towards a group or person that the mere fear of a risk of racism could not deprive citizens of the freedom to express their views on the consequences of immigration in certain towns or neighbourhoods the comments having specifically deplored the transformation of the town of nîmes by immigrants of north african origin and of the muslim faith that the summons to appear before the court had been unlawful and lastly that the impugned remarks had in no way been directed at lt personally and had been distorted by the court of appeal in a judgment of march the court of cassation dismissed his appeal in particular with regard to article of the convention stating as follows first the offence of incitement is established where as in the present case the court finds that by both their meaning and their scope the impugned texts may arouse a feeling of rejection or hostility hatred or violence towards a group or an individual on account of a particular religion second since the abovementioned text falls within the restrictions provided for in paragraph of article of the european convention on human rights the principle of freedom of expression enshrined in paragraph of that article can not be relied upon relevant legal frameworkdomestic law law of july the relevant provisions in force at the material time read as follows section anyone who by uttering speeches cries or threats in a public place or assembly or by means of a written or printed text drawing engraving painting emblem image or any other written spoken or pictorial item sold or distributed offered for sale or exhibited in a public place or assembly or by means of a placard or notice exhibited in a place where it can be seen by the public or by any electronic means of communication to the public has directly incited the perpetrator or perpetrators to commit a serious crime or major offence crime or délit and if the incitement has been acted upon shall be punished as an accomplice in the said offence this provision shall also be applicable where the incitement has been followed only by an attempt to commit a serious crime crime under article of the criminal code section paragraphs and anyone who by one of the means referred to in section has incited discrimination hatred or violence against a person or group on account of their origin or because they belong or do not belong to a given ethnicity nation race or religion shall be liable to a oneyear prison term and a fine of euros or only one of those two sanctions where a conviction is secured for one of the offences provided for in the two preceding paragraphs the court may further ordero the deprivation of the rights listed in paragraphs o and o of article of the criminal code for a maximum of five years save where the offenders liability is engaged under section and the first paragraph of section hereof or under the first three paragraphs of section of law no of july on audiovisual communicationo the display or dissemination of the decision pursuant to article of the criminal code section for the offences délits provided for in the sixth and eighth paragraphs of section section bis the second paragraph of section and the third paragraph of section the limitation period prescribed by section shall be one year section of law no of july on audiovisual communication the relevant provisions as in force at the material time read as follows where one of the offences provided for in chapter iv of the freedom of the press act of july is committed by an electronic means of public communication the publication director or in the situation provided for in the second paragraph of section hereof the codirector shall be prosecuted as the principal when the content of the impugned message has been fixed prior to its communication to the public in the absence thereof the author and failing which the producer shall be prosecuted as principal where charges are brought against the publication director or codirector the author shall be prosecuted as an accomplice any person to whom article of the criminal code is applicable may also be prosecuted as an accomplice where the offence stems from the content of a message addressed by an internet user to an electronic public communication service and made available by that service to the public in a forum of personal contributions identified as such the publication director or codirector may not be held criminally liable as principal if it is established that he or she had no effective knowledge of the message before it was posted on line or if upon becoming aware thereof he or she acted promptly to ensure the deletion of the said message in a decision of september no qpc the constitutional council declared section of law no of july on audiovisual communication to be compliant with the constitution subject to the following consideration consequently taking into account on the one hand the specific liability applicable to the publication director under the first and last paragraphs of section and on the other the characteristics of the internet which as the relevant rules and techniques now stand allow the author of a message disseminated on the internet to preserve his or her anonymity the provisions under review could not without establishing an irrebuttable presumption of criminal liability in breach of the aforementioned constitutional requirements be interpreted as allowing the creator or administrator of an online public communication site enabling messages from internet users to be accessed by the public to be held criminally liable as a producer solely on account of the content of a message of which he or she was unaware before it was posted online subject to that reservation the provisions under review are not contrary to article of the declaration of subsequently in a judgment of october appeal no the criminal division of the court of cassation ruled as follows it can be inferred from section of the law of july that the criminal liability of the producer of an online public communication site enabling messages from internet users to be accessed by the public will only be engaged on account of the content of such messages where it is established that he or she had been aware thereof before they were posted online or that if that were not the case he or she refrained from acting promptly to remove them upon becoming aware thereof however in so deciding without ascertaining whether in his capacity as producer mr x had been aware of the content of the offending message before it was posted online or whether if that were not the case he had refrained from acting promptly to withdraw it as soon as he became aware thereof the court of appeal did not correctly apply section of the amended law of july on audiovisual communication in the light of the abovementioned reservation of the constitutional council the court of cassation had also developed caselaw on the concept of producer adopting this characterisation for a person who had taken the initiative of creating an electronic communication service for the exchange of opinions on predefined topics court of cassation criminal division december bull crim no court of cassation criminal division february bull crim no concerning the liability as producer of the managing director of a company operating a website on account of the dissemination of a number of texts on a discussion forum and court of cassation criminal division february bull crim no concerning the liability as producer of the chair of an association for the dissemination of contentious statements on the latters blog this definition of producer was accepted by the constitutional council which in its decision of september see paragraph above observed it follows from these provisions as interpreted by the court of cassation in its judgments of february that a person who has taken the initiative of creating an online communication service for the exchange of opinions on predefined topics may be prosecuted in his or her capacity as producer furthermore the court of cassation has ruled that the use of the internet is covered by the phrase any electronic means of public communication court of cassation criminal division may bull crim no and court of cassation criminal division may bull crim no while developing caselaw on the concept of publicity which is established when the addressees are not linked to each other by a community of interest and the offending remarks are disseminated via a website

account which were accessible only to individuals approved by the defendant constituted private and not public insults court of cassation criminal division april appeal no as regards the offence délit of incitement to hatred or violence the court of cassation has consistently held that the comments in question must be such as to arouse immediate reactions from the reader against the persons targeted of rejection or even hatred and violence court of cassation criminal division may bull crim no or that the judges must find that both by its meaning and its scope the text at issue may either arouse a feeling of hostility or rejection or incite the public to hatred or violence against a specific person or group court of cassation criminal division july bull crim no court of cassation

and comments may also give rise to sanctions if their meaning is implicit court of cassation criminal division july bull crim no furthermore law no of june on the combat against hateful content on the internet and which was the subject of constitutional council decision no dc of june declaring numerous provisions to be unconstitutional created an online hate observatory its mission is to monitor and analyse developments in this area by involving operators in particular of social networks such as facebook associations authorities and researchers concerned with the combat against and prevention of such acts working groups have been tasked with reflecting on the concept of hateful content improving knowledge of this phenomenon analysing the mechanisms of dissemination and the means of combating it and lastly ensuring prevention education and support for internet users the said law also led to the creation of a national unit for combating online hate within the paris tribunal judiciaire which started operating in january it exercises jurisdiction based on the complexity of the procedure or the extent of the breach of public order which may stem in particular from the high media profile or particular sensitivity of a given case circular of november on the combat against online hate crim e international instruments internet communication the relevant texts adopted by the council of europes committee of ministers and the united nations can be found in paragraphs to of the judgment in delfi as v estonia gc no echr hate speech united nationsa human rights council in his report submitted in accordance with human rights council resolution a september the special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression mr frank la rue made the following observations while some of the above concepts may overlap the special rapporteur considers the following elements to be essential when determining whether an expression constitutes incitement to hatred real and imminent danger of violence resulting from the expression intent of the speaker to incite discrimination hostility or violence and careful consideration by the judiciary of the context in which hatred was expressed given that international law prohibits some forms of speech for their consequences and not for their content as such because what is deeply offensive in one community may not be so in another accordingly any contextual assessment must include consideration of various factors including the existence of patterns of tension between religious or racial communities discrimination against the targeted group the tone and content of the speech the person inciting hatred and the means of disseminating the expression of hate for example a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of facebook users does not carry the same weight as a statement published on a mainstream website similarly artistic expression should be considered with reference to its artistic value and context given that art may be used to provoke strong feelings without the intention of inciting violence discrimination or hostility moreover while states are required to prohibit by law any advocacy of national racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence under article of the covenant there is no requirement to criminalize such expression the special rapporteur underscores that only serious and extreme instances of incitement to hatred which would cross the sevenpart threshold should be criminalized in other cases the special rapporteur is of the view that states should adopt civil laws with the application of diverse remedies including procedural remedies for example access to justice and ensuring effectiveness of domestic institutions and substantive remedies for example reparations that are adequate prompt and proportionate to the gravity of the expression which may include restoring reputation preventing recurrence and providing financial compensation in addition while some types of expression may raise concerns in terms of tolerance civility and respect for others there are instances in which neither criminal nor civil sanctions are justified the special rapporteur wishes to reiterate that the right to freedom of expression includes forms of expression that are offensive disturbing and shocking indeed since not all types of inflammatory hateful or offensive speech amount to incitement the two should not be conflatedb committee on the elimination of racial discrimination general recommendation no of september on combating racist hate speech provides guidelines on the requirements of the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination the aim being to help the states parties to fulfil their obligations it is indicated in particular as follows racist hate speech addressed in committee practice has included all the specific speech forms referred to in article directed against groups recognized in article of the convention which forbids discrimination on grounds of race colour descent or national or ethnic origin such as indigenous peoples descentbased groups and immigrants or noncitizens including migrant domestic workers refugees and asylum seekers as well as speech directed against women members of these and other vulnerable groups in the light of the principle of intersectionality and bearing in mind that criticism of religious leaders or commentary on religious doctrine or tenets of faith should not be prohibited or punished the committees attention has also been engaged by hate speech targeting persons belonging to certain ethnic groups who profess or practice a religion different from the majority including expressions of islamophobia anti semitism and other similar manifestations of hatred against ethnoreligious groups as well as extreme manifestations of hatred such as incitement to genocide and to terrorism stereotyping and stigmatization of members of protected groups has also been the subject of expressions of concern and recommendations adopted by the committee racist hate speech can take many forms and is not confined to explicitly racial remarks as is the case with discrimination under article speech attacking particular racial or ethnic groups may employ indirect language in order to disguise its targets and objectives in line with their obligations under the convention states parties should give due attention to all manifestations of racist hate speech and take effective measures to combat them the principles articulated in the present recommendation apply to racist hate speech whether emanating from individuals or groups in whatever forms it manifests itself orally or in print or disseminated through electronic media including the internet and social networking sites as well as nonverbal forms of expression such as the display of racist symbols images and behaviour at public gatherings including sporting events on the qualification of dissemination and incitement as offences punishable by law the committee considers that the following contextual factors should be taken into account the content and form of speech whether the speech is provocative and direct in what form it is constructed and disseminated and the style in which it is delivered the economic social and political climate prevalent at the time the speech was made and disseminated including the existence of patterns of discrimination against ethnic and other groups including indigenous peoples discourses which in one context are innocuous or neutral may take on a dangerous significance in another in its indicators on genocide the committee emphasized the relevance of locality in appraising the meaning and potential effects of racist hate speech the position or status of the speaker in society and the audience to which the speech is directed the committee consistently draws attention to the role of politicians and other public opinionformers in contributing to the creation of a negative climate towards groups protected by the convention and has encouraged such persons and bodies to adopt positive approaches directed to the promotion of intercultural understanding and harmony the committee is aware of the special importance of freedom of speech in political matters and also that its exercise carries with it special duties and responsibilities the reach of the speech including the nature of the audience and the means of transmission whether the speech was disseminated through mainstream media or the internet and the frequency and extent of the communication in particular when repetition suggests the existence of a deliberate strategy to engender hostility towards ethnic and racial groups the objectives of the speech speech protecting or defending the human rights of individuals and groups should not be subject to criminal or other sanctions informed ethical and objective media including social media and the internet have an essential role in promoting responsibility in the dissemination of ideas and opinions in addition to putting in place appropriate legislation for the media in line with international standards states parties should encourage the public and private media to adopt codes of professional ethics and press codes that incorporate respect for the principles of the convention and other fundamental human rights standards the council of europea the committee of ministers the annex to recommendation no r of the council of europes committee of ministers on hate speech adopted on october provides in particular as follows scope the principles set out hereafter apply to hate speech in particular hate speech disseminated through the media for the purposes of the application of these principles the term hate speech shall be understood as covering all forms of expression which spread incite promote or justify racial hatred xenophobia anti semitism or other forms of hatred based on intolerance including intolerance expressed by aggressive nationalism and ethnocentrism discrimination and hostility against minorities migrants and people of immigrant origin principle the governments of the member states public authorities and public institutions at the national regional and local levels as well as officials have a special responsibility to refrain from statements in particular to the media which may reasonably be understood as hate speech or as speech likely to produce the effect of legitimising spreading or promoting racial hatred xenophobia anti semitism or other forms of discrimination or hatred based on intolerance such statements should be prohibited and publicly disavowed whenever they occur principle national law and practice should allow the courts to bear in mind that specific instances of hate speech may be so insulting to individuals or groups as not to enjoy the level of protection afforded by article of the european convention on human rights to other forms of expression this is the case where hate speech is aimed at the destruction of the rights and freedoms laid down in the convention or at their limitation to a greater extent than provided therein principle national law and practice should allow the competent prosecution authorities to give special attention as far as their discretion permits to cases involving hate speech in this regard these authorities should in particular give careful consideration to the suspects right to freedom of expression given that the imposition of criminal sanctions generally constitutes a serious interference with that freedom the competent courts should when imposing criminal sanctions on persons convicted of hate speech offences ensure strict respect for the principle of proportionality principle national law and practice in the area of hate speech should take due account of the role of the media in communicating information and ideas which expose analyse and explain specific instances of hate speech and the underlying phenomenon in general as well as the right of the public to receive such information and ideas to this end national law and practice should distinguish clearly between the responsibility of the author of expressions of hate speech on the one hand and any responsibility of the media and media professionals contributing to their dissemination as part of their mission to communicate information and ideas on matters of public interest on the other handb european commission against racism and intolerance ecri the relevant passages of ecris general policy recommendation no on combating hate speech adopted on december reads as follows the european commission against racism and intolerance ecritaking note of the differing ways in which hate speech has been defined and is understood at the national and international level as well as of the different forms that it can take considering that hate speech is to be understood for the purpose of the present general policy recommendation as the advocacy promotion or incitement in any form of the denigration hatred or vilification of a person or group of persons as well as any harassment insult negative stereotyping stigmatization or threat in respect of such a person or group of persons and the justification of all the preceding types of expression on the ground of race colour descent national or ethnic origin age disability language religion or belief sex gender gender identity sexual orientation and other personal characteristics or status recognising also that forms of expression that offend shock or disturb will not on that account alone amount to hate speech and that action against the use of hate speech should serve to protect individuals and groups of persons rather than particular beliefs ideologies or religions recognising that the use of hate speech can reflect or promote the unjustified assumption that the user is in some way superior to a person or a group of persons that is or are targeted by it recognising that the use of hate speech may be intended to incite or reasonably expected to have the effect of inciting others to commit acts of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those who are targeted by it and that this is an especially serious form of such speech recognising that the use of hate speech appears to be increasing especially through electronic forms of communication which magnify its impact but that its exact extent remains unclear because of the lack of systematic reporting and collection of data on its occurrence and that this needs to be remedied particularly through the provision of appropriate support for those targeted or affected by it aware that ignorance and insufficient media literacy as well as alienation discrimination indoctrination and marginalisation can be exploited to encourage the use of hate speech without the real character and consequences of such speech being fully appreciated stressing the importance of education in undermining the misconceptions and misinformation that form the basis of hate speech and of the need for such education to be directed in particular to the young recognising that an important means of tackling hate speech is through confronting and condemning it directly by counterspeech that clearly shows its destructive and unacceptable character recognising that politicians religious and community leaders and others in public life have a particularly important responsibility in this regard because of their capacity to exercise influence over a wide audience conscious of the particular contribution that all forms of media whether online or offline can play both in disseminating and combating hate speech recommends that the governments of member states take appropriate and effective action against the use in a public context of hate speech which is intended or can reasonably be expected to incite acts of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those targeted by it through the use of the criminal law provided that no other less restrictive measure would be effective and the right to freedom of expression and opinion is respected and accordinglya ensure that the offences are clearly defined and take due account of the need for a criminal sanction to be appliedb ensure that the scope of these offences is defined in a manner that permits their application to keep pace with technological developmentsc ensure that prosecutions for these offences are brought on a nondiscriminatory basis and are not used in order to suppress criticism of official policies political opposition or religious beliefsd ensure the effective participation of those targeted by hate speech in the relevant proceedingse provide penalties for these offences that take account both of the serious consequences of hate speech and the need for a proportionate responsef monitor the effectiveness of the investigation of complaints and the prosecution of offenders with a view to enhancing both of these in its explanatory memorandum ecri provides the following clarifications the recommendation further recognises that in some instances a particular feature of the use of hate speech is that it may be intended to incite or can reasonably be expected to have the effect of inciting others to commit acts of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those targeted by it as the definition above makes clear the element of incitement entails there being either a clear intention to bring about the commission of acts of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination or an imminent risk of such acts occurring as a consequence of the particular hate speech used intent to incite might be established where there is an unambiguous call by the person using hate speech for others to commit the relevant acts or it might be inferred from the strength of the language used and other relevant circumstances such as the previous conduct of the speaker however the existence of intent may not always be easy to demonstrate particularly where remarks are ostensibly concerned with supposed facts or coded language is being used european union law and caselaw of the court of

amendment cf part iii point hate speech in the latest version of community standards the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant argued that his criminal conviction on account of comments posted by third parties on the wall of his facebook account had breached article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility noting that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded and is not inadmissible on any other grounds within the meaning of article of the convention the court declares it admissible merits the parties submissionsa the applicant the applicant submitted by way of preliminary argument that the domestic courts had extrapolated from the expression kisses to l that it was directed against the partner of the deputy mayor of nîmes and they had relied upon it in convicting him for incitement to racial hatred and discrimination whereas lt had not been the subject of or identifiable in sbs comment he also stressed that he had not been aware at the time of their publication of the comments that had been posted on the wall of his facebook account he pointed out that sb had deleted his comments after his discussion with lt on the same day and argued that he could not therefore be criticised for failing to react promptly to a publication that had materially existed for less than twentyfour hours and in respect of which lt had not sent him any notice to delete even though his contact details in his capacity as a local councillor were in the public domain the applicant stated that he was not a close friend of the couple the deputy mayor of nîmes and his partner that he knew neither the surname nor the forename of the partner and that she was not a public figure lastly he noted that after the comments containing the expression kisses to l had immediately been removed by their author sb only the comments posted by lr remained and the latter had made no reference to lt the applicant concluded that his conviction had been decided in breach of the requirement of foreseeability of the law since he had not been able to anticipate its application to the circumstances of the case the applicant further submitted that the courts caselaw attached the utmost importance to the protection of freedom of expression in the context of political controversy especially during an election period lr had therefore been legitimately entitled to post his unseemly comments about the deterioration of the town of nîmes during the term of office of the outgoing mayor he also submitted that in their caselaw prior to the events the domestic courts had required much harsher language which had to contain an incitement or an encouragement to commit an act the applicant also saw in this a failure to ensure foreseeability and legal certainty by analogy with the caselaw concerning the lack of liability of journalists who merely disseminated statements made by third parties referring to magyar tartalomszolgáltatók egyesülete and indexhu zrt v hungary no february the applicant submitted that his conviction in his capacity merely as publisher or producer did not appear to be a necessary and proportionate restriction of his freedom to impart information given that the authors of the impugned statements had been identified and punished he also criticised the courts for not taking into account the fact that at no time had the person who considered herself the target of the comments asked him to delete them in his view this would entail a strict liability potentially requiring him to close the commenting space altogether and thus entailing a chilling effect on freedom of expression lastly the applicant contended that by requiring him to ensure particular vigilance on account of the fact that his facebook profile was likely to attract comments of a political nature that were in essence polemical the courts had placed a special burden of liability upon himb the government the government began by stating that the criminal offences provided for in the freedom of the press act of july where they were committed not by the written press but by an audiovisual or online means of communication were subject in view of the specific nature of such media to a special system of criminal liability governed by sections and of law no of july they added that facebook pages fell within the category of online communication to the public which was itself included in the broader category of electronic means of public communication they emphasised that according to the court of cassation and the constitutional council the producer was the person who took the initiative of creating an online public communication service for the exchange of opinions on predefined themes the government acknowledged that there had been no other caselaw concerning the criminal liability of an individual who owned a facebook wall on account of comments posted there by third parties they noted however that the court of cassation had previously held that the use of the internet was covered by the phrase any electronic means of communication to the public while developing caselaw on the concept of publicity which was established when the addressees were not linked to each other by a community of interest and the offending remarks were disseminated via a website accessible to the public see paragraph above they further referred to two cases in which the court of cassation had handed down judgments relating to the criminal liability of private individuals producers of an online public communication site enabling messages from internet users to be accessed by the public under section of law no of july on audiovisual communication one concerned the agent of a chain of shops creator of a discussion forum on the internet aimed at allowing nonsalaried managers of the chains shops to express their views who had been sued for defamation on account of comments posted on the forum court of cassation criminal division january appeal no the second concerned the chair of an association for the defence of local residents of a municipality on account of comments posted by internet users on the personal contribution page of the associations website court of cassation criminal division october appeal no the government did not deny that the applicants conviction constituted an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of expression and in particular with his right to impart information however they took the view that this interference was prescribed by law pursued a legitimate aim and was necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention they first pointed out that the court had previously held that a conviction under section of the act of july was prescribed by law within the meaning of article of the convention soulas and others v france no july as to whether the offence could be imputed to the applicant they noted that the concept of producer of an online communication site the definition of which had not changed since the court of cassations judgment of december had been perfectly foreseeable and accessible to the applicant a fact which the latter had not disputed they took the view that the applicant was merely challenging the domestic courts in concreto assessment of the constituent elements of the offence the government added that the applicants analysis of the grounds for his conviction was incorrect in actual fact the domestic courts had noted his status as a politician in order to characterise him as a producer establishing that he had deliberately chosen to set up an online communication site and they had convicted him on the ground that he had not promptly deleted the hateful comments his status as a politician had been noted among other evidence and facts including his own statements about his daily consultation of the site the fact that he could not have been unaware of the comments or the fact that he had been informed of the civil partys anger as to the legitimate aim the government stressed that section of the act of july punished conduct which induced a feeling of hostility rejection or hatred towards members of a community the interference had sought to ensure the protection of the reputation or rights of others this being one of the legitimate aims enumerated in the second paragraph of article as to the necessity of the interference the government noted that the issue was a novel one while acknowledging that similar subjects had been analysed in the courts caselaw they submitted that in view of the context of the case and the nature of the remarks made the state had enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation while this margin was narrower in the case of remarks made by a politician in a political or generalinterest debate this was not the case where they actually constituted hate speech they noted that the applicant had not been convicted for posting on his facebook wall comments expressing a mere political opinion on changes in the town of nîmes but comments that had incited hatred towards the muslim community in general and lt in particular in their view the aim and effect of the impugned remarks had been to arouse a strong feeling of rejection and hatred towards those targets whilst the applicant had maintained that they remained within the limits of freedom of expression since they contained no call to murder or violence in the governments submission the test for hate speech was not whether or not it called for murder but whether it aroused significant feelings of rejection and hatred the impugned statements therefore fell within the scope of hate speech in respect of which states had a broader margin of appreciation in view of the serious consequences that such speech could have the government further argued that as a politician the applicant had special duties and responsibilities in relation to hate speech thus affecting the margin of appreciation to be afforded to the state as to the existence of sufficient and relevant grounds the government first noted the electoral context and consequently the fact that the facebook wall was likely to receive numerous hits lrs comment had been left there even though the applicant had issued a statement urging commentators to be careful thus showing that he had read the posts on the wall of his facebook account therefore the retention of lrs comment together with the warning given could have led the reader to believe that the applicant had not regarded it as problematic and that he was associating himself with it his conviction had therefore been in keeping with the need to combat hate speech effectively during election campaigns with regard to the status of the person targeted by the impugned comments they pointed out that lt was well known but without being a public figure she could therefore legitimately expect not to be associated like the muslim community with the alleged insecurity in the town of nîmes the government further submitted that the national courts in wellreasoned decisions had found that the remarks in question amounted to incitement to hatred they had convicted the applicant because he had deliberately left a hateful comment on the wall of his facebook account despite being aware of its existence the applicant had chosen to allow comments to be posted on his wall and to make it publicly accessible the government pointed out that contrary to the applicants submission the caselaw prior to the relevant events had not required much harsher language containing an incitement or encouragement to commit an act on the contrary according to the court of cassation trial courts had to find that the impugned remarks may incite the public to discrimination hatred or violence against a specific person or group incitement already being defined as any remarks capable of inciting the public to discrimination hatred or violence against a specific person or group the government submitted lastly that the severity of the penalty was proportionate to the offence committed the courts assessment the court notes that it is not in dispute between the parties that the applicants criminal conviction constituted an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by article of the convention such interference will infringe article unless it was prescribed by law pursued one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph and was necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve the aim or aims in questiona prescribed by law the applicant began by complaining about the lack of foreseeability of his criminal conviction alleging a breach of the principle of legal certainty the court however agrees with the governments observation that the applicant merely called into question the in concreto assessment by the domestic courts of the elements of the offence see paragraph above it thus notes that the applicant who did not raise any arguments to dispute the point that the interference was prescribed by law within the meaning of article of the convention in the context of his appeal on points of law see paragraph above was in fact complaining about the assessment by the domestic courts in the circumstances of the case see paragraphs et seq above this being relevant to an examination of the necessity of the interference and not to whether the interference was prescribed by law moreover the court notes that the applicants criminal conviction was handed down mainly on the basis of section first paragraph section eighth paragraph of the law of july and section of law no of july see paragraphs and above it observes that it has previously found that a criminal conviction under sections and of the law of july meets the requirement of foreseeability of the law within the meaning of article of the convention see among other authorities garaudy v france dec no june soulas and others v france no july and le pen v france dec no april it does not see any reason to depart from that finding in the present case the court also notes that the applicant was prosecuted as principal in his capacity as producer within the meaning of section of law no of july in line both with the constitutional councils decision of september and the court of cassations caselaw prior to the applicants conviction concerning the concept of producer see paragraphs above admittedly it finds that the responsibility of a facebook account holder on account of remarks posted on the wall had not previously given rise to any specific caselaw the court would point out however that the novel character particularly in the light of caselaw of the legal question thus raised does not constitute in itself a breach of the requirements of accessibility and foreseeability of the law in so far as the solution adopted was one of the possible and reasonably foreseeable interpretations see mutatis mutandis soros v france no october huhtamäki v finland no march and x and y v france no september in addition and above all the applicant has not called into question this legal basis in terms of the requirements of article not having raised such an objection in the context of his appeal on points of law either see paragraph above the court does not therefore find it necessary to address this aspect of the foreseeability of the law in those circumstances the court does not see any reason to find that the interference was not prescribed by law within the meaning of the second paragraph of article of the conventionb legitimate aim the court finds that the measure pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others see soulas cited above le pen cited above and delfi as v estonia gc no echr c whether the interference was necessary in a democratic societyi general principles the court would refer to the general principles for assessing the necessity of an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression those principles having been frequently reaffirmed by the court since the handyside v the united kingdom judgment december series a no and restated more recently in morice v france gc no echr delfi as cited above and perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extracts with the caselaw references therein the court thus reiterates that freedom of expression is one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to article it applies not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society the adjective necessary in article implies the existence of a pressing social need in general the need for an interference with the exercise of the freedom of expression must be convincingly established admittedly it is primarily for the national authorities to assess whether there is such a need capable of justifying that interference and to that end they enjoy a certain margin of appreciation however the margin of appreciation goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the law and the decisions that apply it in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction the court must examine the interference in the light of the case as a whole including the content of the impugned statements and the context in which they were made in particular it must determine whether the interference in issue was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that these authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and that moreover they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant factsii application to the present case the court observes that the domestic courts found the applicant guilty of the offence of inciting hatred or violence against a group in general and the individual lt in particular on account of their origin or the fact of belonging or not belonging to a given ethnicity nation race or religion the nîmes criminal court relying on the provisions of section of the law of july as interpreted by the constitutional council in its decision of september found that the applicant by taking the initiative of creating an electronic public communication service for the exchange opinions and by allowing lrs comments to remain visible almost six weeks after they had been posted the applicant had not promptly put an end to this dissemination and was therefore guilty in his capacity as principal see paragraph above subsequently the nîmes court of appeal while upholding the firstinstance judgment noted for its part that there was no evidence that the applicant had been informed of the content of the comments before they were posted but that in his capacity as an elected representative and public figure which required him to be particularly vigilant he had knowingly made the wall of his facebook account public and had thus authorised his friends to post comments on it thereby becoming liable for the content of any such posts it also found that the applicant had not promptly stopped the dissemination of the impugned comments while noting that he had further justified his position by claiming that such comments were compatible with freedom of expression and that he had deliberately left them on his facebook wall see paragraph above in the light of the reasoning of the domestic courts the court must in accordance with its settled caselaw examine whether their finding of liability on the part of the applicant was based on relevant and sufficient grounds in the particular circumstances of the case see in relation to a major internet news portal delfi as cited above in doing so and in assessing the proportionality of the impugned penalty it will consider the context of the comments the steps taken by the applicant to remove the comments once posted the possibility of holding the authors liable instead of the applicant and lastly the consequences of the domestic proceedings for the applicant see inter alia delfi as cited above and jezior v poland committee no june α context of impugned comments nature of impugned comments the court notes at the outset that the comments posted on the wall of the applicants facebook account were clearly unlawful in nature see mutatis mutandis delfi as cited above both the criminal court in its judgment of february see paragraph above and the nîmes court of appeal in its judgment of october see paragraph above established in reasoned decisions that first the impugned remarks clearly defined the group concerned namely muslims and that to equate the muslim community with delinquency and insecurity in the city of nîmes by associating this group with drug dealers and prostitutes who reign supreme riffraff who sell drugs all day long or those who throw stones at cars belonging to white people sought in meaning and scope to arouse a strong feeling of rejection and hostility towards the group of people who were known or presumed to be muslims on the other hand the expression kisses to l referring to lt who was associated with fp a deputy mayor of the town of nîmes portrayed in the comments as having contributed to the abandonment of the town to muslims and thus to insecurity was such as to associate her because she was presumed on account of her forename to belong the muslim community with the alleged transformation of the town and thus to arouse hatred and violence against her personally the applicant indeed claimed that lt had not been the subject of sbs comment and had not been identifiable see paragraph above and that lrs remarks made in an electoral context had not exceeded the limits of the right to freedom of expression see paragraphs and above on this point the court reiterates that its role is limited to ascertaining whether the interference at issue in the present case can be regarded as necessary in a democratic society and that contracting states enjoy under article a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the need for and extent of an interference in the freedom of expression protected by that article see mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no echr extracts this margin is defined by the type of expression in question in this connection there is little scope under article of the convention for restrictions on political expression or on debate on questions of public interest see perinçek cited above as regards the electoral context relied upon by the applicant the court would emphasise that the promotion of free political debate is a very important feature of a democratic society it attaches the highest importance to freedom of expression in the context of political debate and considers that very strong reasons are required to justify restrictions on political speech allowing broad restrictions on political speech in individual cases would undoubtedly affect respect for the freedom of expression in general in the state concerned see feldek v slovakia no echr viii and féret v belgium no july however the freedom of political debate is undoubtedly not absolute in nature a contracting state may make it subject to certain restrictions or penalties but it is for the court to give a final ruling on the compatibility of such measures with the freedom of expression enshrined in article see castells v spain april series a no and féret cited above the court thus reiterates that tolerance and respect for the equal dignity of all human beings are the cornerstones of a democratic and pluralistic society it follows that in principle it may be considered necessary in democratic societies to penalise or even prevent all forms of expression that propagate encourage promote or justify hatred based on intolerance including religious intolerance provided that any formalities conditions restrictions or penalties imposed are proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued see féret cited above the court also attaches particular importance to the medium used and the context in which the offending remarks were disseminated and therefore to their potential impact on public order and social cohesion ibid the present case concerned the wall of a facebook account which was freely accessible to the public and used in the context of an election campaign representing a form of expression which was aimed at the electorate in the broad sense and thus the entire population as the court has previously held in the light of its accessibility and its capacity to store and communicate vast amounts of information the internet which includes blogs and social media see magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no november plays an important role in enhancing the publics access to news and facilitating the dissemination of information in general see delfi as cited above however while usergenerated expressive activity on the internet provides an unprecedented platform for the exercise of freedom of expression alongside these benefits certain dangers may also arise defamatory and other types of clearly unlawful speech including hate speech and speech inciting violence can be disseminated like never before ibid savva terentyev v russia no august and savcı çengel v turkey dec no may in an electoral context while political parties should enjoy broad freedom of expression in order to try to convince their electorate in the case of racist or xenophobic discourse such a context may contribute to stirring up hatred and intolerance as the positions of election candidates tend to become more rigid and slogans or catchphrases are given more prominence than reasonable arguments the impact of racist and xenophobic discourse is then likely to become greater and more harmful see féret cited above the court reiterates that the particular responsibility of politicians in combating hate speech has also been emphasised by the committee on the elimination of racial discrimination in its general recommendation no of september see paragraph above and by ecri in its general policy recommendation no see paragraph above the court has examined the offending remarks posted by sb and lr who were not themselves politicians or active members of a political party speaking on its behalf it considers that the domestic courts findings regarding these posts were fully justified the language used clearly incited hatred and violence against a person on account of his or her religious association and this fact can not be disguised or minimised by the electoral context see mutatis mutandis féret cited above or the intended reference to local problems the court reiterates as a matter of principle that inciting hatred does not necessarily involve an explicit call for an act of violence or other criminal acts attacks on persons committed by insulting holding up to ridicule or slandering certain parts of the population or specific groups thereof or to incite hatred and violence against a person on account of his or her religious association as was the case in the present instance will be sufficient for the authorities to seek to combat such xenophobic or otherwise discriminatory speech in response to freedom of expression which has been exercised in an irresponsible manner and is harmful to the dignity or even the safety of those parties or groups ibid and atamanchuk v russia no february the court would also refer to the explanatory memorandum in respect of ecris general policy recommendation no of december see paragraph above according to which in some instances a particular feature of the use of hate speech is that it may be intended to incite or can reasonably be expected to have the effect of inciting others to commit acts of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those targeted by it the element of incitement entails there being either a clear intention to bring about the commission of acts of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination or an imminent risk of such acts occurring as a consequence of the particular hate speech used intent to incite might be established where there is an unambiguous call by the person using hate speech for others to commit the relevant acts or it might be inferred from the strength of the language used and other relevant circumstances such as the previous conduct of the speaker however the existence of intent may not always be easy to demonstrate particularly where remarks are ostensibly concerned with supposed facts or coded language is being used see also kilin v russia no may the applicants liability in respect of comments by third parties the court would point out that the comments in question were expressed in the context of the local political debate more specifically an election campaign for the forthcoming parliamentary elections and that they were posted on the wall of the facebook account of the applicant an elected politician and candidate in those elections while the court attaches the utmost importance to freedom of expression in the context of political debate and considers that political discourse can not be restricted without compelling reasons see paragraph above and it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds are permitted to circulate freely see orlovskaya iskra v russia no february and magyar kétfarkú kutya párt cited above it would nevertheless refer back to its finding as to the clearly unlawful nature of the impugned comments see paragraphs above therefore in addition to the fact that comments made in the context of political debate must not exceed certain limits particularly as regards respect for the reputation and rights of others see le pen v france dec no february in view of the vital importance of combating racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations see jersild v denmark september series a no the applicants status as an elected official can not be regarded as a circumstance mitigating his liability see féret cited above in this connection the court reiterates that it is crucial for politicians when expressing themselves in public to avoid comments that might foster intolerance see erbakan v turkey no july and since they too are subject to duties and responsibilities under article of the convention they should also be particularly careful to defend democracy and its principles especially in an electoral context characterised as in the present case by local tensions their ultimate aim being to govern see féret cited above the court notes moreover that the applicant was not reproached for using his right to freedom of expression particularly in the political debate but for his lack of vigilance and reaction to certain comments posted on the wall of his facebook account the court observes in this connection that fp was precisely one of the applicants political opponents see paragraphs above and that the events took place in a particular local political context with clear tensions within the population which were evident in particular from the comments at issue but also between the protagonists the court has previously emphasised that national authorities are better placed than the court to understand and appreciate the specific societal problems faced in particular communities and contexts see maguire v the united kingdom dec no march from this perspective the court considers that the nîmes court of appeals close knowledge of the local context of the events at issue enabled it to have a better grasp of the context of the impugned comments the court concludes from the foregoing that both the criminal court and the court of appeal based their reasoning as to the applicants liability on relevant and sufficient grounds under article of the conventionβ steps taken by the applicant the court notes that the nîmes court of appeal held that there was no evidence that the applicant had been informed of the content of the comments before they were posted like the firstinstance court it thus examined the applicants conduct only in relation to the period after those comments appeared the domestic courts relied on a number of factors in finding the applicant liable both the criminal court and the nîmes court of appeal noted first of all that the applicant had knowingly made the wall of his facebook account public and had thus authorised his friends namely individuals as at october according to the firstinstance court to post comments on it they concluded that the applicant was therefore under an obligation to monitor the content of the comments posted moreover the criminal court emphasised that the applicant could not have been unaware of the fact that his account was likely to attract comments with an inherently polemical political content and that he had a heightened duty to monitor them specifically see paragraph above the court of appeal considered in the same vein that his status as a political figure required him to be all the more vigilant see paragraph above the criminal court accordingly rejected the applicants arguments that he had not had time to read the comments and was not aware of what sb and lr had posted while the court of appeal pointed out that he had told the investigators that he consulted the wall of his facebook account every day the court further notes that it is not in dispute that sb himself deleted the comment of which he was the author within minutes after lts arrival at his workplace the morning after it was posted lt formally acknowledged this to the investigators stating that she had been able to see that the comment had disappeared shortly after her discussion with sb see paragraph above the impugned comment which was in fact the only one directed at lt and was widely relied upon by the domestic courts in their reasoning was thus promptly withdrawn by its author less than twentyfour hours after being posted accordingly assuming that the applicant had indeed had the time and opportunity to see this comment before its deletion the court considers that to require him to have acted even more promptly bearing in mind that the domestic authorities were unable to show the existence of such an obligation in the light of the particular circumstances of the case would amount to requiring excessive and impracticable responsiveness see mutatis mutandis jezior cited above however the criminal court expressly found that lrs comments for their part were still visible on december see paragraph above that is to say almost six weeks after they were posted compare delfi as cited above and pihl v sweden dec no february cases where the unlawful content remained online for six weeks and nine days respectively contrast jezior cited above the court observes that although the applicant informed the investigators that public access to the wall of his facebook account had been removed the deletion did not take place until a few days before his interview that is to say approximately three months after the events see paragraph above even though sb had told the gendarmes that he had informed the applicant of his altercation with lt on the very same day october see paragraph above admittedly on october the applicant also posted a message on his wall inviting contributors to be careful of the content of their comments but without deleting the impugned comment see paragraph above and in view of his statement that he had been unaware of lrs remarks before being summoned by the gendarmes without having taken the trouble to check or have checked the comments that were then publicly accessible in addition in the courts view there is without any doubt a shared liability between the holder of a social media account and the operator of the network see in the same vein albeit concerning a fan page and not an individual account on facebook the cjeu judgment in unabhängiges landeszentrum für datenschutz schleswig holstein v wirtschaftsakademie schleswig holstein gmb h paragraph above moreover facebooks terms of use already included the prohibition of hate speech indicating that consent to this rule was given by all users upon accessing the network see paragraph above in these circumstances the court is of the view that the grounds given by the criminal court and the court of appeal were one again in respect of the steps taken by the applicant relevant and sufficient within the meaning of article of the convention it considers moreover that this finding is strengthened by the applicants claims as taken into account by the nîmes court of appeal that such comments remained within the limits of freedom of expression see paragraphs and aboveγ possibility of authors of comments being held liable instead the court notes that the authors of the impugned remarks were identified whether directly by lt who immediately recognised sb see paragraph above or by the investigators in the case of lr see paragraph above it points out that the applicant was nevertheless held liable on the basis of section of the law of july in his capacity as the producer of an online public communications site allowing internet users to post publicly accessible messages and incurring liability in particular by failing to remove unlawful messages as soon as he became aware of them it thus notes that although the applicant was considered by law to be the perpetrator of the offence and was sentenced accordingly by the domestic courts he had in fact been accused of conduct which was separate from that of those who actually posted the comments on the wall of his facebook account in other words the domestic courts established the facts for which the applicant was liable and he was not prosecuted instead of sb and lr who were dealt with separately but on account of a particular form of conduct directly linked to his status as holder of the wall of his facebook account in the courts view it is legitimate for such status to entail specific obligations in particular where like the applicant the holder of a facebook wall decides not to avail himself of the possibility of restricting access to it choosing instead to make it accessible to the general public like the domestic courts the court considers that this is particularly true in a context which is conducive to the expression of clearly unlawful comments as in the present case admittedly as advocated in the annex to recommendation no r of the committee of ministers of the council of europe on hate speech see paragraph above domestic law and practice should draw a clear distinction between on the one hand the liability of the author of expressions of hate speech and on the other the potential liability of the media and media professionals who contribute to its dissemination as part of their task of imparting information and ideas on matters of public interest in the present case however the comments were clearly unlawful see paragraphs above and moreover contrary to facebooks terms of use see paragraph above the domestic courts therefore relied on relevant and sufficient grounds in this connectionδ consequences of domestic proceedings for applicant the court observes that the applicant was ordered to pay a fine the amount of which was reduced by the nîmes court of appeal to an amount of euros it reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are also factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference see among many other authorities leroy v france no october and féret cited above it takes the view that having regard to the sentence and the fact that there were no other established consequences for the applicant the interference with his right to freedom of expression was not disproportionate on this basisε conclusion in conclusion having regard to the specific circumstances of the present case the court finds that the decision of the domestic courts to convict the applicant for not having promptly deleted the unlawful comments posted by third parties on the wall of his facebook account used in the context of his election campaign was based on relevant and sufficient reasons having regard to the margin of appreciation afforded to the respondent state the interference may thus be regarded as necessary in a democratic society accordingly there has been no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the courtdeclares unanimously the application admissible holds by six votes to one that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in french and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rules of court signatu_ victor soloveytchik síofra oleary registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the separate opinion of judge mourou vikström is annexed to this judgment solvsdissenting opinion of judge mourouvikströmi am unable to agree with the majority in finding that there has been no violation of article of the convention this case has presented us with a novel question the criminal liability of the holder of a facebook account in respect of messages posted by third parties on his or her wall could the applicant as a mere holder of a facebook account be found criminally liable on account of comments written by third parties to what extent was it possible to convict and sentence him for comments of which he was not the author but which were indeed recognised by the courts as being criminal in nature the question is all the more sensitive as the person concerned is a politician and the events took place during an election campaign on october the applicant while mayor of beaucaire chair of the front national group in the occitanie regional council and candidate in the parliamentary elections wrote on his facebook account a message concerning a political opponent fp who was an mep and deputy to the mayor of nîmes the message which unquestionably had a critical and ironical connotation read as follows while the fn has launched its new national website on schedule spare a thought for the nîmes ump mep fp whose site which was supposed to be launched today is displaying an ominous triple zero on its home page the jibe about the supposed incompetence of fp can unambiguously be seen in this text but it does not as such fall foul of the criminal law it is not in dispute that the facebook account was not administered by anyone except its holder namely the applicant or that the account was accessible to the general public and was not reserved merely for the holders friends thus the public nature of the account and its open access is established even though it appears that only the accepted friends were able to write comments on the same day october two messages were posted on the applicants facebook page by sb and lrlt who was fps partner filed a criminal complaint against sb lr and the applicant taking the view that the messages were racist and with specific regard to the message posted by sb associated her forename as it sounded north african with her partner and with his municipal policy which according to her was presented in such a way as to arouse a feeling of rejection visàvis muslims the authors of these messages together with the applicant in his capacity as holder of the facebook account were convicted with final effect by the domestic criminal courts following a public prosecution and fined the applicant was ordered to pay eur reduced to eur on appeal in addition lt as civil party in the criminal case was awarded the sum of eur euros to be paid by the applicant and sbthe legal texts on the basis of which the applicant was convicted are section first paragraph section eighth paragraph and section of the law of july together with section of law no of july providing for the offence of incitement to hatred or violence against a person or group on account of their origin or the fact of belonging or not belonging to a specific ethnicity nation race or religion the nîmes criminal court and the nîmes court of appeal both took the view with reference to section of the law of july that the applicant even though he was not the actual author of the offending messages had to be found liable since he had chosen to make his wall public and had thereby made it available for his friends to post messages that were visible to all following a confrontation with lt sb deleted the impugned message on october the day after its publication on the applicants wall the message by lr was for its part still visible on december about six weeks after its publication however the applicant claimed without there being any proof or even any allegations to the contrary that he had not become aware of the impugned message by lr until a few days before he was summoned by the investigators who interviewed him on january public access was removed three days before he was due to attend the police interview which would seem to corroborate the idea that his knowledge of the impugned remarks did indeed coincide with the police summons his reaction in removing public access was thus prompt at that point in this opinion i will not be analysing the merits of the conviction of the two main authors of the messages sb and lr but will argue that the conviction of the facebook account holder who was found to incur specific liability is incompatible with the requirements of article of the convention in my view it is important to dissociate the facts of the present case from the position of principle as to the applicants liability for even though a case is to be adjudicated in concreto its scope is not limited to a casespecific solution as it has much broader significance the application of this projected or derived liability of the facebook account holder is to my mind capable of breaching the right to free expression of commentators and account holders especially in the case of public figures or politicians who have a large number of friends it should be noted that in the case of delfi as v estonia gc no echr the court did make a clear distinction between the delfi website which it defined as a large professionally managed internet news portal run on a commercial basis which published news articles of its own and invited its readers to comment on them and other types of online fora where thirdparty comments can be disseminated for example an internet discussion forum or a bulletin board where users can freely set out their ideas on any topic without the discussion being channelled by any input from the forums administrator or a social media platform where the platform provider does not offer content and where the content provider may be a private person running the website or blog as a hobby ibid with reference therefore to the delfi caselaw it is clear that the present applicants facebook account would fall within the second category at the very least the reasons why the chamber judgment departs from the framework set out in delfi should have been explained by the majority here the same liability can not be attributed to the holder of a facebook account as to a news portal which invites its readers to make comments that are accessible to the general public and incidentally have commercial repercussions for the website delfi was an active host whose polemical vocation was well known thus its awareness of the messages posted on its site were to be presumed such a setup can not reasonably be transposed to the user of a facebook account otherwise as the dissenting judges in delfi emphasised it would be an invitation to selfcensorship at its worst moreover the decisions of the domestic courts supported by the finding of no violation reached by the majority in the present judgment are not in line with the statutory prescriptions as interpreted by the constitutional council setting an important and clear reservation as to the criminal liability of the holder of a website that is open for comment it should be pointed out that the liability of the producer of an electronic public communication service may only be established if he or she was aware of the messages before they were posted or otherwise if he or she has failed to act promptly to remove them upon becoming aware of them in the present case only the comment by lr should raise an issue since that of sb was spontaneously deleted by him within twentyfour hours can the holder of a facebook account be expected to react within a few hours after the posting of a message by a third party the applicant could not reasonably have been required to have deleted sbs message within a twentyfour hour period otherwise the obligation to react would be excessive and impracticable moreover as to the message posted by lr is it possible to prove that the applicant was aware of it to establish criminal liability any knowledge he may have had of lrs message can not be a matter of speculation or even presumption it requires evidence the domestic courts however failed to demonstrate the existence of such knowledge preferring to base their reasoning on a general obligation to monitor comments particularly relying on the applicants status as a politician while it is true that on october two days after lrs comment the applicant invited his friends in a message on his facebook wall to be careful with the content of their comments there is nothing to suggest that he was aware of the impugned comment by lr he might well have been referring implicitly when making this appeal for vigilance to the other message that sb had posted and promptly deleted bearing in mind that knowledge is one of the basic elements for the purpose of establishing the criminal liability of the account holder it must be demonstrated in compliance with the rules of criminal law which it goes without saying have to be interpreted strictly therefore only an unequivocal message by an individual feeling offended by the comments or simply condemning them for falling within the scope of the law on incitement to hatred would have been such as to prove that the applicant had been aware of the impugned comments but no such message exists it is not in dispute that lt did not seek to warn the applicant about the content of lrs message or even that of sbs message the domestic courts based their decisions to convict the applicant on the following findings the fact that the applicant as a politician could not have been unaware that his account would generate and encourage messages that would be in essence political and therefore polemical in this connection it is noteworthy that the message that the applicant himself had initially published was admittedly critical of and mocked his political opponent but it had not been directed against any part of the population and still less incited hatred against anyone the liability of the applicant who had taken the initiative of setting up an electronic public communication platform and had failed to delete with sufficient rapidity the comments posted by certain friends that he had accepted on facebook it should be noted straight away that the fact that sb informed the applicant of his discussion with lt and of the subsequent withdrawal of his message is not such as to place on the applicant a duty of heightened vigilance extending to a presumption that he was aware of the other comments posted on his wall it is important to dissociate this case from the context and even the content of the impugned remarks in order to focus solely on the criminal liability of the facebook account holder where he or she is like the applicant a public figure the finding of no violation of article of the convention places a very heavy burden on the account holder in terms of monitoring posts since he or she would otherwise face criminal prosecution there is a risk that such a fear will cause the account holder to systematically vet and even to censor certain comments posted on his or her wall in case of doubt as to the legal consequence of a comment posted by someone else the account holder will of course be more inclined to delete or report a message by way of precaution the chilling effect is selfevident thus entailing a serious threat to freedom of expression,,,
71,the applicant was born in and lives in béziers the applicant is the former head of the basque separatist organisation iparretarrak after his detention in he was convicted several times on march he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for criminal association with a view to preparing a terrorist offence on november he was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder in the framework of terrorist

the framework of terrorist activity killing a gendarme and on march he was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment for conspiracy to murder complicity in murder and armed robbery by judgment of february the sentence enforcement division of the paris court of appeal released him on licence from february to february ordering to follow a sevenyear programme of assistance and supervision the government pointed out that the applicant was the first person sentenced to life imprisonment for offences linked to terrorism ever to have been released on licence the sentence enforcement division reiterated in its judgment that the applicants release on licence would be accompanied by the following general obligations article of the penal code complying with the instructions of the sentence enforcement judge or of the social worker from the prison rehabilitation and probation service receiving visits from the latter and providing him or her with information or documents facilitating supervision of his livelihood and compliance with his obligations informing the social worker of any job changes and if such changes are liable to hamper compliance with his obligations obtaining prior authorisation from the sentence enforcement judge informing the social worker of any changes of address and of any travel lasting for more than two weeks reporting back to the latter on his return and obtaining the authorisation of the sentence enforcement judge for any foreign travel and for any change of job or of address liable to impede compliance with his obligations the division added the following special obligations article and of the penal code exercising an occupation or following vocational education or training residing in béziers continuing in accordance with his means to pay into the guarantee fund for the compensation of victims of terrorism and refraining from possessing or carrying a weapon on november the criminal chamber of the court of cassation dismissed the appeal on points of law lodged by the public prosecutor with the paris court of appeal on december the applicant took part in a peaceful demonstration outside agen prison in support of basque detainees being held there the media reported on that demonstration consequently the paris sentence enforcement court delivered a judgment on may imposing additional special obligations on the applicant refraining from attending in the vicinity of a prison or other detention facility any demonstration in support of persons detained for terrorist offences or of any association or movement which is committing or has committed terrorist acts article of the penal code refraining from distributing any document or audiovisual material produced or coproduced by himself concerning in whole or in part an offence committed by himself and refraining from discussing that offence in public article of the penal code that judgment was upheld by judgment of the paris court of appeal on october however the latter judgment was quashed by judgment of the criminal chamber of the court of cassation on june on the grounds that the sentence enforcement court did not have jurisdiction to modify the obligations for release on licence for which matter the sentence enforcement judge held jurisdiction on february the public prosecutors office requested that the sentence enforcement judge of the regional court of paris add both the aforementioned obligations to the applicants list of obligations for release on licence as well as a prohibition on contacting any person actively engaged in promoting basque separatism or supporting detainees convicted of or charged with terrorist acts pursuant to articles to of the penal code particularly with a view to expressing support for such detainees article of the penal code by judgment of june the sentence enforcement judge decided to impose on the applicant the obligation set out in article of the penal code refraining from distributing any document or audiovisual material produced or coproduced by himself concerning in whole or in part the offence committed and refraining from discussing that offence in public whereby these provisions are applicable only in cases of convictions for serious offences of intentional homicide sexual assault or sexual abuse he noted that in its judgment of february the paris court of appeal had described the applicant as a calm respectful person who spent most of his time writing his memoirs the judge inferred that although it is unclear what the word memoirs entails it is quite possible that mr bidart might be tempted to publish his memoirs and make statements on the offences of which he was convicted nor did the judgment go into further detail on that point it explained however that during the adversarial proceedings mr bidart was reminded that the prosecution had requested the prohibition only of writings or statements connected with the offences of which he had been convicted that judgment was upheld by judgment of the paris court of appeal on august stating that the obligation in question merely prohibited commenting on or condoning the offences committed and that the obligation was not a disproportionate measure in the light of the need to protect public order nor does it prevent philippe bidart from expressing his political convictions by judgment of march the criminal division of the court of cassation dismissed the appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant on the grounds that in its judgment the court of appeal had properly applied article of the penal code in compliance with the legal texts and conventions relevant to the applicants appeal including article of the convention the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that his freedom of expression had been restricted in the framework of his release on licence he relied on article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument b merits the partiesa the applicant the applicant submitted that when the paris court of appeal had initially decided to release him on licence it had not considered it necessary to impose any obligations affecting his freedom of expression that he had always scrupulously honoured all the obligations imposed on him in the framework of his release on licence and that he had at no stage since his release condoned the offences of which he had been convicted in his view that fact demonstrated that there was no need for such a restriction whose disproportionality also stemmed from its general nature which afforded the judicial authorities a very wide margin of appreciation in fact the restriction was tantamount to banning him from voicing any opinion on the current political situation in the basque country since the offences of which he had been convicted had been committed in that context the applicant took the view that despite the careful language used by the french judges the real purpose of the obligation in question was to prohibit him from uttering any statement concerning the history and the political context of the northern basque country it was therefore an attempt unjustifiably to infringe his freedom of opinion and expression particularly as it transpired from article of the code of criminal procedure that only measures aimed at the convicted persons rehabilitation and prevention of recidivism could be imposed in the framework of release on licenceb the government the government agreed that the prohibition imposed on the applicant amounted to an interference in the exercise of his right to freedom of expression they considered however that that interference was prescribed by law that is to say in article of the penal code which met the requirements of precision and clarity set out in the caselaw of the court particularly since the sentence enforcement judge and the court of appeal had pointed out that the measure imposed merely prohibited commenting on or condoning the offences committed and the applicant had not been banned from expressing his political convictions as regards the meaning of the word condoning apologie in french we might refer to the definition given in the larousse dictionary commending or justifying something presented in a document or a speech speech or document glorifying an act expressly prohibited by law eg condoning murder or racial hatred the government submitted that the interference had pursued several of the legitimate aims listed in the second paragraph of article the protection of public safety prevention of disorder or crime and the protection of the reputation or rights of others namely those of the victims of the crimes committed by the applicant and of their families on the latter point they emphasised that the applicants release on licence had caused much emotion not only among the victims families but also more broadly within the local population particularly because on the one hand on leaving the prison the applicant had given a speech in basque stating that his joy at being free was not complete because the french state did not recognise the basque country and on the other hand a few months later he had taken part in a demonstration in support of basque prisoners during which he had denounced the injustice of the situation of those political prisoners and stated that they should be released according to the government therefore the aim had been to prevent any act or comment likely to offend the victims families and any further criminal activity with reference to the judgment in the case of leroy v france no october the government observed that in the courts view the legitimacy of the aims pursued by the interference should be assessed in the light of the sensitivity of the endeavour to combat terrorism and the need for the authorities to remain vigilant about acts liable to increase the attendant violence the government further considered that the interference had been necessary in a democratic society they referred to zana v turkey november reports of judgments and decisions vii where the court had stated that it had with due regard to the circumstances of each case and a states margin of appreciation to ascertain whether a fair balance had been struck between the individuals fundamental right to freedom of expression and a democratic societys legitimate right to protect itself against the activities of terrorist organisations they pointed out that the court had already had occasion to consider the situation in the basque country in the cases of leroy cited above and association ekin v france no echr viii as regards the proportionality of the measure they emphasised first of all that article of the penal code limited the scope of the impugned restriction to specific offences considered as extremely serious and that the provision only applied to persons who were on probation were serving a semicustodial sentence or had been released on licence and that that restriction was implemented strictly in the framework and context of release on licence that is to say in the context of individualised penalties aimed at the early release of a convicted person under certain conditions with the fundamental aim of facilitating his rehabilitation as that aim required the person concerned to stand back from the offences which he had committed it had not been disproportionate to expect the applicant to refrain from any circulation of writings or documents or any public speech amounting to commenting on or condoning offences which had offended large sections of the general public furthermore regard should be had to the fact that the impugned obligation had been imposed on the applicant following his participation in a demonstration outside agen prison in support of basque prisoners which the domestic courts availing themselves of their discretionary powers had regarded as conduct incompatible with his rehabilitation as it had been liable to expose him to risks of recidivism and to cause public disorder according to the government the obligation had been linked to the situation and conduct of the applicant who had held a special position in the basque terrorist organisation owing to the influence of his words it had been necessary to take precautions to ensure that others did not interpret his words and behaviour as a call to further violence secondly according to the government the impugned restriction had been strictly limited in its purpose because it had only covered utterances on the offences of which the applicant had been convicted moreover although the applicant had run the risk of having his release on licence revoked in the event of noncompliance with that obligation such a sanction which was left to the discretion of the judges would not have been automatic and could only have been a partial revocation they added that the revocation had been limited in time because it ended as required on expiry of the release licence the court the court notes that in the framework of the applicants release on licence the domestic courts had in particular imposed on him the obligation to refrain from circulating any document or audiovisual material produced or coproduced by himself concerning the offences of which he had been convicted and to refrain from making any public reference to those offences that is obviously a restriction on the exercise of his freedom of expression within the meaning of article of the convention which fact moreover the government do not deny such an interference infringes that provision unless it is prescribed by law pursues one or more of the legitimate aims set out in article and is necessary in a democratic society to attain those aims the court first of all notes that the legal basis of the restriction is provided by article of the code of criminal procedure and article of the penal code which state in particular that the sentence enforcement judge can make the release on licence of a person convicted of serious offences of intentional homicide subject to an obligation to refrain from circulating any document or audiovisual material produced or coproduced by himself concerning the offence committed and to refrain from making any public reference to that offence the court consequently concludes that the restriction was prescribed by law secondly it notes that the government refer to several of the legitimate aims listed in article the protection of public safety prevention of disorder or crime and the protection of the reputation or rights of others it observes however that the domestic courts concentrated solely on the fact that the impugned measure was necessary for the prevention of public disorder see paragraphs and above that being the case the court takes note of the governments explanations to the effect that the release on licence of the applicant a former head of the basque separatist organisation iparretarrak who had been sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of three persons in a terrorist context had caused widespread emotion among the victims families and more broadly within the local population it observes as stated by the government that the impugned measure was taken a few months after the beginning of the applicants release on licence following his participation in a peaceful demonstration outside agen prison in support of basque prisoners who were held there which participation had attracted media coverage the court also understands why in that context the judicial authorities might have feared that the applicant would place himself in a position conducive to possible recidivism it therefore accepts having regard to the situation prevailing in the basque country see association ekin cited above that the restriction complained of pursued one of the aims listed in article namely prevention of disorder or crime the fundamental principles as regards the necessity in a democratic society of an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression are well established in the courts caselaw and may be summarised as follows see among other authorities hertel v switzerland august case reports vi steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no echr animal defenders international v the united kingdom gc no echr morice v france gc no april and delfi as v estonia gc no echr i freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individuals selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demands of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society as set forth in article this freedom is subject to exceptions which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by article iii the courts task in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised its discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts in leroy cited above relating to the publication of a satirical drawing in a basque weekly magazine and zana cited above referred to by the government the court pointed out that those principles apply to measures taken by national authorities to maintain national security and public safety as part of the fight against terrorism and that it must with due regard to the circumstances of each case and a states margin of appreciation ascertain whether a fair balance has been struck between the individuals fundamental right to freedom of expression and a democratic societys legitimate right to protect itself against the activities of terrorist organisations these considerations are relevant to the present case mutatis mutandis the court has also emphasised that although article does not as such prohibit prior restraints on publication or bans on distribution of information or ideas the dangers which restrictions of that kind pose for a democratic society are such that they call for the most careful scrutiny on the part of the court see in particular association ekin cited above and éditions plon v france no echr iv that is particularly true in the case of measures to prevent the distribution of comments which are only potential at the time of adoption of the former in the present case therefore the court is concerned by the fact that when deciding to impose the impugned restriction on the applicant the sentence enforcement judge did not base his decision on the latters specific comments or writings but on potential comments or writings stating that it was quite possible that he might be tempted to publish his memoirs and make statements on the offences of which he was convicted the court further considers it regrettable that the domestic judge neither balanced the competing interests nor fully characterised the risk of public disorder that being the case the court notes that decisions to apply article of the code of criminal procedure are not administrative but judicial because they are taken by the sentence enforcement judge and the convicted persons in question can lodge an ordinary appeal followed by an appeal on points of law it notes that the applicant availed himself of that right since he appealed to the paris court of appel against the judgment imposing the impugned obligation emphasising in particular that that obligation merely prohibited him commenting on or condoning the offences committed that it was not a disproportionate measure in the light of the need to protect public order and that it in no way prevented him from expressing his political convictions and that he subsequently appealed on points of law to the court of cassation see paragraphs and above he therefore benefited from judicial review providing genuine safeguards against abuse to which procedure the court attaches great importance see association ekin cited above the court further notes that the measures taken pursuant to paragraph of that article are limited in three respects they are limited with regard to the persons on whom they can be imposed as they apply solely to persons convicted of specific crimes or offences culpable injury of life sexual assault or sexual abuse they are also limited not only in time ending at the same time as the period of release on licence but also in their purpose since they can only affect the persons freedom of expression on the offence which he or she had committed in the present case moreover the paris court of appeal very clearly reiterated in its judgment of august that the restriction imposed on the applicant merely prohibited commenting on or condoning the offences committed see paragraph above it would therefore seem that contrary to his allegations the applicant retained the right to express his views on the basque question provided that he did not mention the offences of which he had been convicted when the court assesses an interference with the rights secured under article it also attaches great importance to the limited nature of the measure adopted see for example donaldson v the united kingdom dec january furthermore the present case should also been seen in the light mutatis mutandis of the case of nilsen v the united kingdom dec no march in which relying on his freedom of expression a prisoner complained of the fact that the manuscript of his autobiography had been confiscated on the ground in particular that it had gone into detail on the crimes of which he had been convicted while reiterating that prisoners in general continue to enjoy all the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed under the convention save for the right to liberty and in particular the right to freedom of expression and any restriction must be specifically justified in each case the court found that the complaint under article was manifestly illfounded owing in particular to the fact that the impugned measure had not amounted to a complete restriction on the exercise of the rights set out in that provision finally the court can not overlook the context in which the applicants freedom of expression was restricted that is to say that the decision was taken to restrict that right in the framework of the early release of a major wellknown figure in a terrorist organisation who had been sentenced to life imprisonment for murders committed in a terrorist context which early release as already mentioned in paragraph above had caused considerable emotion among the victims families and more broadly within the local population all these factors lead the court to accept that in imposing on the applicant in the framework of his release on licence the obligation to refrain from distributing any document or audiovisual material produced or coproduced by himself concerning in whole or in part the offences of which he was convicted and to refrain from making any public reference to those offences the domestic courts did not exceed the margin of appreciation available to them therefore there was no violation of article of the convention for these reasons the court unanimously holds that there has been no violation of article of the convention done in french and notified in writing on november pursuant to rule and of the rules of court milan blaško josep casadevall deputy registrar president,,,
72,the applicant company is a limited liability company and is the owner of the greek television channel alpha on january alpha broadcast a television show named jungle ζούγκλα in which three videos that had been filmed with a hidden camera were broadcast in the first video ac then a member of the hellenic parliament and chairman of the interparty committee on electronic gambling was shown entering a gambling arcade and playing on two machines the second video showed a meeting between ac and associates of the television host of jungle mt during which the first video was shown to ac the third video showed a meeting between ac and mt in the latters office on january the videos were shown again during a television show named yellow press κίτρινος τύπος presented by the same television host on may the national radio and television council εθνικό συμβούλιο ραδιοτηλεόρασης following an invitation to the applicant company held a hearing in which the applicant company was represented by its attorneys as can be seen from the minutes of the meeting the applicant companys attorneys acknowledged the use of hidden camera in the abovementioned incidents they argued that such use had been justified owing to ac being a public figure and that it had served the public interest as proven by the fact that the report had resulted in acs being dismissed from the parliamentary group of the political party for which he had been elected as parliamentary deputy in their view that had been the result not only of acs gambling activities but also of the fact that he had tried to negotiate with the applicant companys reporters to present the incident differently the applicant companys attorneys further argued that the use of a hidden camera had been exceptional and had been resorted to following the receipt of information that could not have been verified otherwise as nobody would have believed the journalists allegations if they had reported on the issue without broadcasting the images it can also be seen from the minutes that the members of the national radio and television council expressed their disagreement regarding the use of a hidden camera arguing that if anyone were able to use a hidden camera by claiming that there was an overriding public interest in doing so then all citizens especially if they were public figures would be exposed to the possibility of being subject to pressure and extortion they furthermore stressed that nobody would ever forbid journalists to report on a certain issue however the means used raised an issue as the use of hidden camera could be accepted only in respect of a national security issue or for the prevention of a serious crime or other similar situations they also noted that there were two separate issues in the instant case on the one hand the use of a hidden camera and on the other hand the entrapment of ac by its decision the national radio and television council ordered the applicant company to pay one hundred thousand euros eur for each of the two television shows during which the abovementioned videos were shown as well as to broadcast on three days in a row on its main news show the content of that decision the decision included a short description of the three videos a citation of the relevant legislation and the conclusion that the use of hidden camera in that case had not been in accordance with the relevant law it further stated that the sanctions had been imposed following an assessment of the gravity of the offence of the number of viewers of the two television shows of the size of the investment that had been made by the applicant company and the fact that the television channel had been repeatedly fined in the past for the same offence on june the decision of the national radio and television council was communicated to the minister of press and media who after examining its legality issued decision no e confirming its content on april the applicant company lodged an application for annulment αίτηση ακύρωσης against the decisions of the national radio and television council and the minister of press and media with the supreme administrative court συμβούλιο της επικρατείας on the grounds that the abovementioned decision had violated articles and of the greek constitution as well as article of the convention ac lodged a thirdparty intervention requesting from the supreme administrative court to dismiss the application for annulment on january the president of the supreme administrative court referred the case to the plenary supreme administrative court owing to its high importance the hearing before the plenary supreme administrative court took place on june by its judgment no published on april and finalised on may δημοσίευση και καθαρογραφή the supreme administrative court dismissed the application for annulment in its legal assessment the majority of the supreme administrative court firstly referred to the constitutional provisions providing the right to impart and receive information and then emphasised that this right is subject to limitations whose legitimate aim is the protection of the rights of others and the observance of the rule of law on condition that those limitations are proportionate it additionally referred to the courts caselaw in respect of article and on article with specific reference to caselaw concerning the protection of a persons image see von hannover v germany no echr vi schüssel v austria dec no february and sciacca v italy no echr i it continued by noting that under article of the constitution the state has the legal duty to exercise control over the radio and television in order to ensure respect for human values and that sanctions imposed by the national radio and television council served that purpose the supreme administrative court laid down the conditions under which it is legitimate to broadcast an image that has been filmed with the method of hidden camera by making a distinction between reporting on specific news whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret means and the broadcasting of the relevant secretly recorded image according to that reasoning recording by secret means an image which has as its main or only subject a specific person constitutes in principle a violation of that persons right to his own image which is protected by articles of the constitution and of the convention as a specific aspect of the right to respect for ones private life consequently the broadcasting on television of news whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret means can not in principle be considered as constituting the legitimate exercise of the right to impart information given that the disseminated news has been received under circumstances which constitute a violation of an individuals right to his own image nevertheless in certain cases it may be considered justified to broadcast such news on account of its contribution to a debate of general interest and taking into account the secretly recorded persons position or standing however even when broadcasting of the news is considered a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information this does not automatically render legitimate the broadcasting of the relevant secretly recorded images as that constitutes a much more intense έντονος limitation of the constitutionally protected right of that person to his own image than the simple transmission of news in the domestic courts view broadcasting of a secretly recorded image can only be justified if the legitimate for the reasons mentioned above broadcasting of such news is completely impossible or particularly difficult without broadcasting the image that was recorded by hidden means and which constitutes the source of the news by applying the abovementioned principles to the circumstances of the case the supreme administrative court dismissed the applicant companys argument that it had legitimately transmitted the news concerning ac in view of acs capacity as a public figure the domestic court stressed that from the text of the decision and from the minutes of the meeting of the national radio and television council it derived that the sanction was imposed to the applicant company solely and exclusively on account of the broadcast of the images that had been recorded by hidden means and not on account of the transmission of the news whose source had been the secretly recorded images as far as the broadcasting of the images was concerned the applicant company had not disputed that the images had been recorded by secret means and had not claimed that broadcasting of the news was absolutely impossible or extremely difficult without broadcasting the relevant images therefore the applicant companys allegation that it had broadcast the impugned images for reasons of journalistic interest and of public interest was dismissed on the basis of the abovementioned reasoning the supreme administrative court ruled that the decision of the national radio and television council had been fully reasoned and dismissed the applicant companys application for annulment a concurring more specific ειδικότερη opinion was joined to the majority opinion the seven judges considered that the recording of a person without his knowledge and the use of it for the broadcasting of news constituted a direct violation of that persons right to dignity as it reduces him to an instrument for others to achieving goals that are irrelevant to him given that pursuant to articles and of the constitution the protection of human dignity is absolute the broadcasting of such news is always forbidden irrespective of whether such a broadcast includes the image in question for those reasons the judges who supported this opinion considered that the application for annulment should be dismissed in addition there were two dissenting opinions according to the first one in view of the fact that the national radio and television council had considered that the broadcasting of news that had been recorded by secret means had constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information the same considerations should be extended to the broadcasting of the relevant image the reason for this was the special nature of television in comparison with the other media owing to which the broadcasting of the image went handinhand with broadcasting the news itself therefore the application for annulment should have been allowed given that the national radio and television councils decision had been based solely on the fact that the image of ac had been recorded by hidden means without considering whether broadcasting news whose source was the above images constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information lastly according to the other dissenting opinion no constitutional provision justified the absolute protection of an image as was held by the majority a persons right to his own image was susceptible to limitations that varied according to that persons position and the space in which the recording in question had taken place for individuals protection against the recording of their image without their consent was absolute irrespective of whether it took place in a public or private space unless the recording was not directed to them or the recording of the image took place with a view to the prevention of crimes in public space for public figures however protection was less absolute in particular public figures such as politicians were exposed to publicity and sometimes they even pursued it as a result there was a legitimate expectation on the part of the media and of the public to impart and receive information regarding their public activities for these persons there was an absolute protection of their image in their private space and in public spaces in which they shared private or family moments when however public figures were in public spaces but not under the conditions described above or acted in a way that was of interest to the public such as in cases in which they engaged in behaviour contrary to what their public role entailed or contrary to the image they projected towards the public then the right to receive and impart information could justify the recording of that person without his consent and the broadcasting of the relevant images by the media in this regard the dissenting judges argued that it would be inconceivable to equate radio with television as they did not operate on the same way therefore it would not be possible for a television show to simply announce the news without broadcasting the relevant images as would be the case on the radio in respect of legitimately recorded images when there is a balance between transparency and the right to receive information on the one hand and the protection of a persons image on the other hand the presumption should be that the recorded image could be broadcast without consent in view of the above the four judges considered that the application for annulment should be allowed taking into account especially the fact that ac was a public figure that the recording of his image had taken place in a public space that is to say in a gambling arcade and that the broadcasting of the relevant images had served the purpose of informing the public of behaviour on the part of a member of parliament that did not meet the requirements of his position therefore the television channels decision to broadcast the image as a part of the television shows which otherwise could be considered unfounded or even defamatory had not breached the proportionality principle ii relevant domestic lawa the constitution the relevant articles of the greek constitution provide as follows article a all persons have the right to information as specified by law restrictions on this right may be imposed by law

photographs tapes television images using legitimate journalistic methods and always making his capacity as a journalist known the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant company complained that the sanctions imposed on it by the national radio and television council had violated its right to freedom of expression as provided in article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties argumentsa the applicant companys arguments the applicant company maintained that the decision of the national radio and television council to impose administrative sanctions on it on account of the three videos that had been filmed with a hidden camera and broadcast in two of its television shows had violated its right to freedom of expression in particular the applicant company argued that the fines imposed on it specifically eur in respect of each of the two television shows during which the videos had been broadcast as well as the obligation to broadcast the content of the abovementioned decision had interfered with its right to freedom of expression and in particular with its right to impart information the applicant company argued that the images recorded by the use of a hidden camera concerned the behaviour of a public figure who had been at the time a member of the hellenic parliament and chairman of the interparty committee on the widespread use of electronic gambling therefore his participation in gambling games had been a matter of public interest in the light of acs public role and could have affected his duties as a member of parliament and as chairman of the parliamentary committee on electronic gambling viewers had had the right to learn the truth about an elected deputy in any event electronic gambling had been a matter of general interest in greece at the time as many citizens had been financially destroyed owing to their participation in similar games that had been the reason why the two television shows had prepared the broadcasts in question in view of the above the broadcasting of videos that had been filmed by the use of a hidden camera had been necessary and acs right to private life had been outweighed by the applicant companys right to impart information concerning a matter of public interest both the national radio and television council which had imposed the administrative sanctions and the supreme administrative court which had dismissed the application for annulment had failed in the present case to strike a fair balance between the applicant companys right under article and acs right under article of the convention in addition the broadcasting of the second video had been necessary as it had showed that ac had tried to negotiate with the journalists who had filmed the first incident in particular ac had appeared to request that the journalists present the incident as if he had been gambling in order to experiment within the context of his parliamentary duties in exchange he offered to appear live on the television shows in the applicant companys view such behaviour on the part of a public figure had had to be exposed therefore the broadcasting of that video had been necessary and had fulfilled part of the applicant companys duty to inform the public pursuant to article of the convention the applicant company maintained that as far as the first video was concerned ac had been filmed in a public space namely in a gambling arcade in addition the use of hidden camera had been necessary in order to document and prove his behaviour as he would never have given his consent to being filmed playing on gambling machines as proven by the fact that he had tried to negotiate with the journalists in order that the filmed incidents might be presented differently lastly the applicant company argued that in any event the fine that had been imposed on it by the national radio and television council had not been proportionate to the offence in question and stressed that the imposition of similar sanctions were jeopardising televisions role in disseminating news as protected by article of the conventionb the governments arguments the government contested the argument that there had been any interference with the applicant companys right to impart information or with the publics right to receive information in particular the government argued that the decision of the national radio and television council had made it clear that the sanctions were being imposed because of the broadcasting of images that had been captured using a hidden camera and not because of the broadcasting of the legitimately transmitted news that ac had been spotted entering a gambling arcade and playing on gambling machines the same considerations applied to the second video the sanctions had been imposed because of the broadcasting of the images and not because of the transmission of the news of the meeting that had taken place between ac and the television stations reporters the government further maintained that even if it were to be accepted that there had been interference with the applicant companys rights under article of the convention such interference had been prescribed by the domestic legislation namely article of the constitution article c of law no articles and of regulation and article of regulation of the national radio and television council and article b and f of the code on journalistic ethics issued by the journalists union additionally the government asserted that any interference with the applicant companys right to impart information had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and reputation of others specifically acs right to private life as protected under article of the convention in respect of the necessity of the alleged interference the government stressed that all three videos had been filmed by illegitimate means namely a hidden camera without the consent and knowledge of ac and in violation of the relevant legislation in addition the images on all three videos as well as the filmed conversations of ac with journalists on the second and third videos had breached criminal law and in particular article a of the criminal code therefore the applicant company had been aware that it had breached all the abovementioned provisions of domestic legislation by filming and broadcasting the impugned videos in the governments view the applicant company had not advanced any argument as to why the broadcasting of the videos had been necessary and why it had not been sufficient to merely broadcast the news without showing the videos that had been recorded in violation of acs right to his own image the videos had not contributed to a public debate but had merely satisfied the publics curiosity and had been used as a means of securing higher ratings for the programmes this could not have been considered a legitimate reason for violating acs right to his own image in view of the above the national radio and television council which considered that the applicant company could have broadcast the news but not the videos that had been the source of the news and had consequently imposed sanctions on the applicant company had not erred but had struck a fair balance between the rights protected under articles and of the convention referring to the courts caselaw bédat v switzerland gc no echr the government argued that the sanction imposed had constituted an exercise of the positive obligation arising from article in order to effectively protect acs right to his own image in addition it had been in accordance with the courts caselaw which made clear that the wide protection afforded to the press did not mean that journalists were not obliged to respect national legislation and the code on journalistic ethics the alleged interference had addressed a pressing social need namely that in a democratic society dialogue should be conducted without the use of means which harmed the reputation and image of individuals unless such means contributing to a public debate lastly as regards the proportionality of the interference the government stressed that the plenary supreme administrative court had found the sanctions proportionate as it had been clear that the national radio and television council had taken into account the gravity of the offence as well as the applicant companys previouslyincurred sanctions for similar offences in the past in addition national legislation provided for far more severe sanctions than the ones imposed on the applicant company the courts assessmenta the existence of interference the court notes that it is in dispute between the parties whether the imposition on the applicant company of the fine and the obligation to broadcast the content of the relevant decision imposed constituted interference with its freedom of expression in particular the government maintained that the sanctions imposed on the applicant company had not interfered with its freedom of expression as they had not concerned the broadcasting of the news the source of which was the videos that had been filmed with a hidden camera but the projection of the videos themselves which had been filmed by illicit means the court notes that it has consistently held that freedom of expression includes the publication of photographs von hannover v germany no gc nos and echr similarly freedom of expression has been considered to include the broadcasting of videos see haldimann and others v switzerland no echr it additionally notes that it is not for the court any more than it is for the national courts to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what techniques of reporting should be adopted in a particular case see jersild v denmark september series a no and stoll v switzerland gc no echr v consequently the court considers that the sanctions imposed on the applicant company on account of its broadcasting the impugned videos constituted interference with its freedom of expression such interference will infringe the convention unless it satisfies the requirements of paragraph of article the court must therefore determine whether it was prescribed by law pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in that paragraph and was necessary in a democratic society to achieve those aimsb prescribed by law it has not been disputed that the legal basis for the imposition of the sanctions on the applicant company was article of the constitution article c of law no articles and of regulation and article of regulation of the national radio and television council and article b and f of the code on journalistic ethics the court thus concludes that the impugned interference was prescribed by law within the meaning of the second paragraph of article of the conventionc legitimate aim the government submitted that the imposition of sanctions on the applicant company had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation and rights of others specifically of ac the applicant company did not contest that argument the court observes that acs image and voice were recorded without his knowledge and then broadcast against his will in a television programme with high viewing figures it therefore considers that the measure in issue pursued the aim of protecting the rights and reputation of others specifically acs right to respect for his image words and reputationd necessary in a democratic societyi general principles the general principles governing an assessment of whether an interference with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention are wellsettled in the courts caselaw they were recently restated in pentikäinen v finland gc no echr bédat cited above and couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no echr extracts the court notes that account must be taken of the need to strike the right balance between the various interests involved because of their direct continuous contact with the realities of the country a states courts are in a better position than an international court to determine how at a given time the right balance can be struck for this reason in matters under article of the convention the contracting states have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity and scope of any interference in the freedom of expression protected by that article in particular when a balance has to be struck between conflicting private interests see among other authorities palomo sánchez and others v spain gc nos and echr however this margin goes hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it even those delivered by an independent court in exercising its supervisory function the courts task is not to take the place of the national courts but rather to review in the light of the case as a whole whether the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation are compatible with the provisions of the convention relied on if the balance struck by the national judicial authorities is unsatisfactory in particular because the importance or the scope of one of the fundamental rights at stake was not duly considered the margin of appreciation accorded to the decisions of the national courts will be a narrow one see aksu v turkey gc nos and echr where however the exercise of striking a balance between two conflicting rights was undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the courts caselaw the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see von hannover no cited above and couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above the court reiterates that the outcome of the application should not in theory vary according to whether it has been lodged with the court under article of the convention by the person who was the subject of the news report or under article by the publisher indeed as a matter of principle these rights deserve equal respect see von hannover no cited above accordingly the margin of appreciation should in theory be the same in both cases the court has identified in so far as relevant to the present case the following criteria within the context of balancing competing rights the contribution to a debate of public interest the degree to which the person affected is wellknown the subject of the news report the method of obtaining the information and its veracity the prior conduct of the person concerned the content form and consequences of the publication and the severity of the sanction imposed see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above axel springer ag v germany gc no february and von hannover no cited above in addition the court reiterates that it is commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual media often have a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media see jersild cited above and peck v the united kingdom no echr i accordingly although freedom of expression also extends to the publication of photographs the court recalls that this is an area in which the protection of the rights of others takes on particular importance especially where the images contain very personal and intimate information about an individual or where they are taken on private premises and clandestinely through the use of secret recording devices see von hannover cited above hachette filipacchi associés ici paris v france no july and mgn limited v the united kingdom no january factors relevant to an assessment of where the balance between competing interests lies include the additional contribution made by the publication of the photographs to a debate of general interest as well as the content of the photographs see krone verlag gmb h co kg v austria no february ii application of the above principles in the present caseα contribution of the report to a debate of public interest an initial essential criterion is the contribution made by articles in the press to a debate of public interest the court has previously recognised the existence of such an interest where the publication concerned political issues or crimes see axel springer ag cited above with further references the applicant company maintained that the videos had been disseminated within the context of two television broadcasts devoted to the social issue of gambling and had contributed to the public debate concerning that issue which had been a widespread problem in greece at the time it additionally claimed that the videos had included information concerning the conduct of ac a member of the greek parliament at the time who had also been chairman of the interparty committee on electronic gambling and that they therefore concerned in general a matter of public interest that is to say the conduct of an elected representative the government contested the argument that the videos might have made an additional contribution to the debate of public interest arguing that they had merely served the purpose of securing higher programme ratings the court notes that both the national radio and television council and the supreme administrative court by applying the relevant legislation and principles and acknowledging that the news had been lawfully broadcast implicitly acknowledged that the subject of the report concerned a matter of public interest in addition they had considered that the applicant company had been entitled to report on the issue they had only contested the applicant companys entitlement to broadcast the impugned videos in addition to the news itself see paragraph above the court assessing the report as a whole as well as the substance of the information that is disclosed in it and having regard to the observations of the domestic authorities see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above agrees with the domestic authorities assessment of whether the report was in the public interest it notes in particular that the widespread use of gambling constituted a debate of considerable public interest turning to whether the report in question was capable of contributing to the public debate at issue see stoll cited above echr v the court observes that the report in question was not without political import in particular it could arouse the interest of the public with regard to the conduct of an elected representative visàvis electronic gambling who additionally was chairman of an interparty committee on electronic gamblingβ degree of notoriety of the person affected and the subject of the report the court reiterates that the role or function of the person concerned and the nature of the activities that are the subject of the news report andor photograph constitute another important criterion to be taken into consideration see von hannover no cited above and axel springer cited above the extent to which an individual has a public profile or is wellknown influences the protection that may be afforded to his or her private life thus the court has acknowledged on numerous occasions that the public was entitled to be informed about certain aspects of the private life of public figures see inter alia karhuvaara and iltalehti v finland no echr x nevertheless in certain circumstances even where a person is known to the general public he or she may rely on a legitimate expectation of protection of and respect for his or her private life see inter alia von hannover no cited above thus the fact that an individual belongs to the category of public figures can not in any way even in the case of persons exercising official functions authorise the media to violate the professional and ethical principles which must govern their actions or legitimise intrusions into private life see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above in the present case the court notes that ac as a member of parliament and the chairman of the interparty committee on electronic gambling was undeniably a prominent political figure the domestic authorities ought therefore to have considered the extent to which this prominence and those public functions were capable of influencing the protection which could be afforded to his private life ibid the court notes that the domestic authorities did not explicitly address this point in fact the national radio and television council in its decision made no reference to acs public functions but merely referred to the relevant legislative provisions which provide the general protection of the right to private life and ones right to ones own image the supreme administrative court however stated that an exception could be made to the principle of the protection of private life whenever the facts disclosed could give rise to a debate on account of their impact in the light of the status or position of the person concerned see paragraph above although it drew no conclusion from that consideration in so far as broadcasting the impugned videos was concerned nevertheless the court considers that it can be derived from the domestic authorities conclusions notably that the news whose source was the videos that had been recorded with a hidden camera could legitimately be broadcast those authorities took into account acs public functions see von hannover v germany no no september the court therefore concludes that this element was sufficiently taken into account by the domestic authorities when striking a balance between the competing interests as regards the subject of the report the court notes that from the parties arguments as well as from the minutes of the hearing that took place before the national radio and television council where the applicant companys attorneys admitted that the reporters had made use of a hidden camera following their receipt of specific information it follows that the report focused on the behaviour of ac and not on a general discussion of electronic gambling contrast haldimann and others cited above this is corroborated by the fact that all three videos were focused on ac and his reaction to the first video which showed him entering a gambling arcade and gambling on electronic machines both the national radio and television council and the supreme administrative court accepted that the report concerning acs behaviour could be legitimately broadcast nevertheless they made a distinction between the news whose source had been the videos recorded by hidden camera and the broadcasting of the videos themselves the court shares the domestic authorities position as regards the distinction made between the report on the one hand and the broadcasting of the videos on the other hand the court notes that its own caselaw acknowledges that the protection of the rights and reputation of others takes on particular importance in the context of the publication of photographs which may contain very personal or even intimate information see von hannover no cited above and eerikäinen and others cited above the same considerations apply even more so to the broadcasting of videos since the audiovisual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media see jersild cited above therefore even taking into account the special features of television there can be no objection to distinguishing between reporting on specific news and the broadcasting of a video see mutatis mutandis mgn limited v the united kingdom cited above verlagsgruppe news gmb h and bobi v austria no december and société de conception de presse et dédition v france no february even though undoubtedly the broadcasting of the video added credibility to the account of events given in the report see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above γ prior conduct of the person concerned the court notes that neither the domestic courts nor the parties commented on acs prior conduct in the circumstances of the case the court considers that the material in the case file is not in itself sufficient to enable it to take cognisance of or examine acs previous conduct with regard to the media moreover the mere fact that a person has cooperated with the press on previous occasions can not serve as an argument for depriving that person discussed in an article of all protection see egeland and hanseid v norway no april an individuals alleged or real previous tolerance or accommodation with regard to publications touching on his or her private life does not necessarily deprive that individual of the right to privacy see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above δ circumstances under which the video was taken method of obtaining the information and its veracity the manner in which the information was obtained and its veracity are also important factors in this connection the court reiterates that the protection afforded by article of the convention to journalists is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism see mutatis mutandis bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc cited above fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i kasabova v bulgaria no and april and times newspapers ltd v the united kingdom nos and nos and echr however the concept of responsible journalism as a professional activity which enjoys the protection of article of the convention is not confined to the contents of information which is collected andor disseminated by journalistic means that concept also embraces inter alia the lawfulness of the conduct of a journalist including his or her public interaction with the authorities when exercising journalistic functions the fact that a journalist has breached the law in that connection is a most relevant albeit not decisive consideration when determining whether he or she has acted responsibly see pentikäinen cited above the court reiterates in this context that journalists who exercise their freedom of expression undertake duties and responsibilities see stoll cited above and handyside v the united kingdom december in fine series a no it will be recalled in this connection that paragraph of article does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to media coverage of matters of serious public concern in particular and notwithstanding the vital role played by the media in a democratic society journalists can not in principle be released from their duty to obey the ordinary criminal law on the basis that as journalists article affords them a castiron defence see among other authorities mutatis mutandis stoll cited above bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above and monnat v switzerland no echr x in other words a journalist can not claim exclusive immunity from criminal liability for the sole reason that unlike other individuals exercising the right to freedom of expression the offence in question was committed during the performance of his or her journalistic functions see pentikäinen cited above turning to the circumstances of the present case the court observes that both parties agreed in substance that the use of a hidden camera was not absolutely prohibited in domestic law but that it could be accepted subject to strict conditions it was not disputed among the parties that pursuant to article of the code on journalistic ethics the use of this technique was permitted only where there was an overriding public interest in the dissemination of the relevant information provided that the collection of the information did not violate a persons dignity the court has already established that the report concerned a matter of public interest it considers that what is important at this stage is an assessment of the conduct of the applicant companys employees in this connection the court notes that in the first video ac was filmed entering a gambling arcade and playing on electronic gambling machines therefore the applicant companys employees recorded the first video in a public space that is to say a place accessible to anyone by contrast the second video was recorded in unknown premises and showed journalists of the television show projecting the first video to ac as regards the third video the court does not have in its possession sufficiently detailed knowledge other than that it was filmed in the hosts office the court notes that the domestic authorities assessed the journalists conduct as a whole imposing one sanction on the applicant company for all three videos in the courts view however there are significant differences between the circumstances under which the first video was filmed on the one hand and those under which the second and third videos were filmed on the other hand without a doubt the use of a hidden camera in this case raises serious issues under the relevant greek legislation in respect of all three videos nevertheless the fact that the first video was filmed in a public space in which anyone could have taken a photograph or as in the instant case filmed a video of the member of the parliament is a factor that should have been taken into consideration by the domestic authorities when assessing the journalists conduct the court has previously considered in cases falling under the scope of article albeit in a different context that on occasions when people knowingly or intentionally involve themselves in activities which are or may be recorded or reported in a public manner a persons reasonable expectations as to privacy may be a significant although not necessarily conclusive factor see pg and jh v the united kingdom no echr ix on the contrary as regards the second and third videos the court considers that in light of the clear position under greek criminal law ac was entitled to have an expectation of privacy as he entered private spaces with a view to discussing the recorded incidents and for his conversations not to be recorded without his explicit consent in this connection the court considers that the journalists of the applicant company did not act in good faith in their meetings with ac who would have been entitled to feel deceived the court also notes that the national radio and television council emphasised that the second and third videos were recorded by the journalists with a view to exercising pressure on ac and the applicant company did not adduce any argument to rebut this other than claiming that recording ac with a hidden camera had been necessary as he would never have consented to being filmed in addition as the government pointed out the journalists working in the applicant company breached criminal law and in particular article a of the criminal code which protects the confidentiality of conversations in the courts view the journalists of the television show as professionals must have been aware of the relevant legislative provisions and should have been aware that at that time they were in breach not only of professional ethics but also of criminal law therefore such a breach can only be regarded as deliberate irrespective of the veracity of the relevant information which was not disputed the court also notes that the national radio and television council based its decision on the abovementioned considerations and accordingly sanctioned the applicant company for its use of a hidden camera which resulted in an interference with acs right to his own image from the minutes of the meeting it can also be seen that the council attached significant weight to the entrapment of ac see above the same considerations apply to the supreme administrative court which without questioning the legitimacy of broadcasting news whose source had consisted of the impugned videos ruled that the applicant company had acted in breach of the code on journalistic ethics which provided for the use of direct and legitimate means when one exercised the right to impart information compare tierbefreier e v v germany no january the supreme administrative court emphasised the fact that the applicant company had not put forward any argument as to why it had been necessary to broadcast the videos that had been filmed without the knowledge and consent of ac in the courts view the domestic authorities conclusion that the applicant company overstepped the limits of responsible journalism is not unreasonable at least in so far as the second and third videos are concerned in this connection the court attaches some weight to the fact that the applicant company had already been sanctioned for the same offence in the past however as regards the first video the court considers that the domestic authorities failed to take into consideration in their assessment the fact that it was filmed in a public place an element which in the courts view weakens the legitimacy of any expectation of privacy ac might have had when he entered the gambling arcade therefore the present case is distinguishable from haldimann and others v switzerland no echr in which the court ruled that the applicants should have been given the benefit of the doubt as to whether they had intended to act in breach of the ethical rules governing their profession in that case the court took into account the fact that the applicants had taken every measure to protect the brokers image by pixellating his image and altering his voice in the present case however it is clear that the applicant company made no effort to compensate for the intrusion into acs private life on the contrary his conduct had been the central subject matter of the videos while the conduct of the journalists in the present case suggests that the breach of the code on journalistic ethics and of the criminal code was deliberate the case is further distinguishable from the case of radio twist as v slovakia no echr xv in which the court ruled that there had been a violation of article after taking into account the fact that it had not been the applicant company or its employees that had been responsible for the recording in question which had been undertaken by illegal means ibid in the present case however it has not been disputed by the parties that the applicant companys employees deployed illegal means with a view to capturing ac gambling and his reaction to the contents of the first videoε content form and consequences of the broadcast as regards the content and form of the broadcast the court notes that the first video showed ac entering a gambling arcade and gambling on two machines the second video showed a meeting between ac and associates of the television host of jungle mt during which the first video was shown to ac the third video concerned a meeting between ac and mt in the latters office the content of the second and third videos has not been described in detail to the court by the parties however from the applicant companys submissions which have not been refuted by the government it appears that in the meetings recorded on those videos ac was shown trying to convince the journalists to present the first video as an experiment connected with his parliamentary duties in exchange he offered to appear live on television in respect of the consequences of the broadcast the court can not help but notice that according to the applicant company the impugned videos resulted in acs removal from the parliamentary group of the political party for which he had been elected as deputy in the courts view such a consequence can only be regarded as serious and as having directly affected acστ the severity of the sanction lastly the court recalls that the nature and severity of any sanction imposed are also factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference see among other authorities ceylan v turkey gc no echr iv and annen ii v germany dec nos and march in this regard the court observes that the national radio and television council took into account the gravity of the offence the number of viewers that had watched the two television shows the size of the investment that the applicant company had made and the fact that the applicant company had been repeatedly sanctioned for committing the same offence in the past on the basis of the abovementioned considerations it imposed on the applicant company the relevant sanctions namely eur euros in respect of each of the two television shows during which the impugned videos were broadcast and the obligation to disseminate the content of the decision the supreme administrative court upheld the relevant sanctions considering that they were proportionate and that the lack of specific details regarding the number of viewers or the size of the investment the applicant company had made did not have any impact on the proportionality of the sanctions it further took into account the fact that article of law no provided for far stricter penalties including fines as high as eur and the temporary suspension or even the indefinite interruption of the broadcasting of a television show than those imposed on the applicant company the court moreover notes that the sanctions were imposed on the applicant company and not on the journalists who had made use of the hidden camera or who hosted the television shows in view of the above the court accepts that the sanctions imposed on the applicant company were relatively lenient though not insignificant and that a number of factors were taken into account when imposing them such as the applicant companys past behaviour in relation to similar incidents the court also considers that the sanctions imposed can not be said to have had a deterrent effect on the press reporting on matters of public interestζ conclusion the court observes that the domestic authorities fully recognised that the present case involved a conflict between the right to impart ideas and the right of others to protection of their private life and tried to carefully balance the competing rights in that respect they attached fundamental importance to the way the information was obtained and to the journalistic duties and obligations of the applicant company on the basis of the above they imposed the relevant sanctions on the applicant company in the courts opinion these conclusions can not be considered to be unreasonable or based on a misrepresentation of the relevant facts in so far as the second and third videos were concerned despite the somewhat laconic manner in which some of them were expressed the reasons put forward by the domestic courts in support of their conclusions were in keeping with the principles set forth in the courts caselaw in particular the domestic authorities acknowledged that the news whose source was the impugned videos had been legitimately disseminated but considered that the videos had constituted a substantially more farreaching interference with acs right to his image this conclusion was in line with the courts caselaw according to which even though freedom of expression extends to the publication of photographs this is an area in which the protection of the rights of others takes on particular importance especially where the images contain very personal and intimate information about an individual or where they are taken on private premises and clandestinely through the use of secret recording devices see von hannover cited above hachette filipacchi associés ici paris cited above and mgn limited cited above in view of the above the court concludes that in the circumstances of the present case the reasons given by the greek authorities were relevant and sufficient to justify the interference in respect of the second and third videos the court reiterates that although opinions may differ on the outcome of the judgment where a balancing exercise was undertaken by the national authorities the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts see lillo stenberg and sæther v norway no january with references to axel springer ag and von hannover no both cited above in these circumstances and having regard to the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the domestic courts when balancing competing interests the court concludes that there are no strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic authorities and that there has accordingly been no violation of article of the convention in respect of the second and third videos on the contrary in so far as the first video is concerned the court considers that the domestic authorities failed to take into account the circumstances under which it was obtained despite the fact that it too was filmed by a hidden camera the court attaches great importance to the fact that it was not recorded in private premises and that the interference with acs rights under article was therefore significantly less serious the court is thus of the opinion that the domestic authorities should have included in their assessment the fact that ac by entering a gambling arcade could legitimately have expected his conduct to have been closely monitored and even recorded on camera especially in view of the fact that he was a public figure having regard to these considerations and despite the margin of appreciation afforded to the domestic authorities the court finds that in assessing the circumstances submitted for their appreciation they did not strike a reasonable balance of proportionality between the measures restricting the applicant companys right to freedom of expression imposed by them and the legitimate aim pursued the court therefore concludes that there has been a violation of article of the convention in respect of the first video ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant company complained that the length of the proceedings before the supreme administrative court had been excessive it relied on article which in its relevant parts reads as follows in the determination of his civil rights and obligations everyone is entitled to a hearing within a reasonable time by a tribunal a admissibility the court notes at the outset that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds it must therefore be declared admissible b merits the parties arguments the applicant company maintained that the length of the proceedings before the supreme administrative court had been incompatible with the reasonable time requirement laid down in article of the convention in particular it claimed that the procedure had lasted seven years from the date on which it had lodged the application for annulment and that the fault for the delay had lain with the authorities the government contended that the length of the proceedings could not be considered unreasonable in view of the complexity of the case the seriousness of the matters examined and the number of thirdparty interveners it additionally stressed that the case had initially been scheduled to be examined by the fourth section of the supreme administrative court but that owing to its importance and complexity it had been referred to the plenary supreme administrative court the courts assessmenta period to take into consideration the period to take into consideration began on april the date on which the applicant company lodged the application for annulment before the supreme administrative court and ended on may when judgment no was finalised therefore the impugned proceedings have lasted seven years and two monthsb reasonableness of the length of proceedings the court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in accordance with wellestablished caselaw in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria the complexity of the case the conduct of the applicants and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicants in the dispute see among many other authorities frydlender v france gc no echr vii lupeni greek catholic parish and others v romania gc no echr extracts and vassilios athanasiou and others v greece no december the court has examined on many occasions cases raising questions akin to the one in issue here namely the duration of administrative proceedings and concluded that there had been a breach of article vassilios athanasiou and others cited above and the cases cited therein even accepting the governments argument that the case presented a certain complexity and that its importance led to the fourth section of the supreme administrative court relinquishing the case to the plenary supreme administrative court the court notes that the proceedings lasted more than seven years for one instance having regard to its caselaw on the subject the court considers that the government have advanced no fact or argument justifying a different conclusion in the present case therefore in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive accordingly there has been a breach of article of the convention iii application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court finds that there has been a violation of the convention or the protocols thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party a damage the applicant company claimed euros eur in respect of pecuniary damage which was the level of the fine imposed on it by the national radio and television council in this regard it submitted a certificate drafted by its managing director according to which on march the applicant company paid to the domestic authorities the sum of eur however the relevant proof of payment had been destroyed at some point during the years that had elapsed in the meantime it additionally claimed eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage arguing that the excessive length of the domestic proceedings in addition to the sanctions imposed on it had been made publicly known and had been covered widely in the press thus damaging its reputation the government considered that in the event that a violation was found such a finding should constitute sufficient compensation for the applicant company in addition the government contested the causal link between the fine imposed on the applicant company pursuant to the domestic legislation and the alleged violation of article of the convention they further argued that the applicant company could have lodged an application with the domestic courts for the reimbursement of the amount they had paid as a fine under article of the introductory law to the civil code governing compensation in cases of an illegal act or an omission on the part of the state in any event the government submitted certificates from the relevant fiscal authorities attesting to the fact that the applicant company had paid eur and not eur as they had erroneously maintained on the basis of the documents in its possession the court accepts that the applicant company paid only eur of the fine imposed in relation to all three videos the court further observes that in the present case it has found a violation of the applicants rights guaranteed by article of the convention only in respect of the first video in view of the above the court finds that there is a causal link between the violation found and part of the pecuniary damage incurred taking into account the documents before it the court finds it reasonable to award eur to the applicant company in respect of pecuniary damage in addition it considers that the violation of articles and must have caused damage to the applicant companys reputation and prolonged uncertainty in this regard the court reiterates that it may award just satisfaction for nonpecuniary damage to a commercial company nonpecuniary damage suffered by such companies may include aspects that are to a greater or lesser extent objective or subjective aspects that may be taken into account include the companys reputation uncertainty in decisionplanning disruption in the management of the company for which there is no precise method of calculating the consequences and lastly albeit to a lesser degree the anxiety and inconvenience caused to the members of the management team see comingersoll sa v portugal gc no echr iv having regard to all the evidence in its possession and ruling on an equitable basis as required by article of the convention the court
