investigating judge the assailant wa charged with false impersonation unlawful deprivation of liberty and attempted rape the proceeding have commenced and they shall of course have their conclusion the local police otherwise very prompt when it come to informing the public even of much lesser offence simply kept silent about the incident the press also received no information from the investigating judge or the public prosecution service which ha otherwise also been cooperative with respect to providing information concerning it activity this magazine indirectly found out about the horrific ordeal suffered by our underaged fellow citizen the police only provided u with information following receipt of our written request asking them to confirm or deny the detail which we had learnt from others nongovernmental organisation focused on romani right issue also stayed quiet the case of an underaged street vendor wa probably not a priority for their rich donor the city administration likewise did nothing with respect to their own official why did they all remain silent uncomfortable question will soon have to be answered by those in power did the police keep quiet about the attempted rape just because it concerned a romani girl did anyone and if so who from the city administration intervene in order to cover up the shameful incident wa the idea to thereby buy time so a to make it possible for the head of the municipal branch office to strike a deal with the gypsy until they are paid off to withdraw their complaint of attempted rape lastly but most importantly whose interest is it in to protect the bully who is getting his salary paid from the municipal budget while in his free time attempting to rape his underaged fellow citizen for a long a

kragujevcu thereafter heard the defendant and the alleged victim a well a a number of witness it furthermore took into account the statement given and the documentation obtained in the course of the preliminary proceeding in the meantime on september the alleged victim provided the court with her own a well her mother courtcertified statement of september wherein they both fully recanted their earlier testimony accusing mr b of the crime in question on december the kragujevac court of first instance acquitted mr b of all charge on june following a remittal on appeal the same court again acquitted mr b of all charge on december this judgment wa upheld by the kragujevac appeal court apelacioni sud u kragujevcu at second instance and it thereby became final the civil proceeding in july mr b lodged a civil defamation claim with the kragujevac high court viši sud u kragujevcu against the applicant m a and svetlost regarding the two published article on december this court ruled partly in favour of mr b and ordered the applicant and svetlost only not m a to pay him jointly a total of serbian dinar rsd a well a statutory interest a of that date on account of the mental anguish suffered a a consequence of the breach of his honour and reputation plus rsd in litigation cost the court furthermore ordered the said two respondent to publish this judgment without comment or delay in their own news magazine the kragujevac high court explained a regard the first article and with specific reference to paragraph thereof that inter alia the applicant a it author had stated a fact that mr b had committed the crime of unlawful deprivation of liberty false impersonation and attempted rape despite the fact that the criminal proceeding against the latter had still been pending thereby breaching his right to be presumed innocent furthermore the applicant had included an untrue statement of fact when he had reported that mr b had committed the crime of attempted rape even though he had known that the police had not pressed charge for that particular criminal offence see paragraph above with respect to the second article prepared by m a and specifically a regard paragraph and thereof the court rejected the plaintiff claim noting that this piece had been written accurately based on the information provided by the police themselves see paragraph above lastly the court noted the existence of the statement of september see paragraph above but reiterated that it had no bearing on the present case since it had been given after the publication of the article in question on april the kragujevac appeal court partly amended the judgment delivered at first instance in so doing it ordered the applicant m a and svetlost to pay mr b jointly a total of rsd approximately euro eur at the time on account of the mental anguish suffered a a consequence of the breach of his honour and reputation a well a statutory interest from december plus rsd in litigation cost approximately eur at the time the obligation on the part of the respondent to publish the judgment wa upheld in it reasoning which wa essentially along the line of that offered by the kragujevac high court the kragujevac appeal court nevertheless held inter alia that a the award of rsd had been excessive given the existing interest of the public to be informed of the incident in question albeit in a more appropriate manner b m a had also incorrectly stated a fact in the title of her piece despite the more accurate text just below it that mr b had attempted to rape an underaged girl and c mr b could not be considered a public figure and a such someone who should have had to withstand more criticism since he had merely been employed a the head of a municipal branch office and had not been a local government official službenik u teritorijalnoj jedinici lokalne samouprave the above ruling relied on inter alia some of the relevant provision of the obligation act and the public

noted inter alia that should he fail to comply his entire property would be subject to enforcement izvršenje na celokupnoj imovini according to the information provided by the applicant since may he had been unemployed and lacking any movable asset of relevance to the enforcement procedure this wa also why the civil judgment in question had not yet been enforced the applicant however stated that he did own a flat in which he had been living with his family and that mr b could yet seek enforcement on this property the government confirmed that a of april the civil judgment at issue remained unenforced other relevant fact in his statement given to the kragujevac high court on october a part of the civil defamation proceeding mr b recounted that after the publication of the article in question he had called the applicant and had asked him why such piece had been published at all the applicant in response had offered him the opportunity to deny the allegation in the newsmagazines next issue but mr b had refused this offer because he had not wanted to debate the matter through the medium lastly mr b had informed the applicant that he would instead be bringing legal proceeding in this regard on june mr b visited a neuropsychiatrist allegedly a a consequence of the distress which he had suffered due to the publication of the article on the same date he wa also provided with

of local branch office shall be municipal employee appointed either by the municipal assembly themselves or by other body authorised to do so by the municipal assembly the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that he had suffered a breach of his freedom of expression in particular he maintained i that the printed article in question had raised serious issue to do with the alleged sexual abuse of an underaged romani girl and ii that he had ultimately ended up being punished for the article publication by losing a civil defamation case and being ordered to pay compensation plus cost to mr b article of the convention in so far a relevant read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to impart information and idea without interference by public authority the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the court note that the application is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any of the other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merit the party submissionsa the applicant the applicant reaffirmed his complaint he added that the situation a regard the protection of minority group in serbia had been poor particularly with respect to the rom who had been among the most vulnerable group in the country moreover even though mr b had not been formally charged with false impersonation or attempted rape given what had in fact happened during the incident and the similarity between and interconnectedness of the offence in question it had not been wrong generally speaking to describe his action a such in any event while svetlost had been fully entitled to present negative value judgment regarding an incident which had clearly been of great public interest there had never been any intent to gratuitously harm mr b a illustrated by the latter own statement given in court on october see paragraph above the applicant furthermore submitted that in the present case everything had been done in order to cover up the incident and secure impunity for the perpetrator simply because the victim herself had been of romani origin the criminal proceeding against mr b had thus ultimately collapsed due to the pressure which had been brought to bear on the victim and her mother which in turn had had the consequence of them recanting their allegation in respect of mr b see paragraph above lastly the applicant argued that in the serbian legal system the position of a head of a municipal branch office wa a very important public function see paragraph above and maintained that the compensation and cost which had been awarded against him had never been enforced only because he had neither had the property nor the income to cover those amount see paragraph aboveb the government the government endorsed the reasoning of the civil court see paragraph and above a well a the reason which had been offered by the constitutional court see paragraph above and maintained that there had been no violation of article in the present case in particular the interference with the applicant freedom of expression had been in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation of others see paragraph above furthermore the civil court had not awarded compensation to mr b for any negative value judgment expressed in the article but for the publication of untrue statement of fact which had ended up seriously harming his wellbeing and affecting his reputation see paragraph above according to the government the medium in general had to show a greater degree of respect for the presumption of innocence a well a attention and seriousness when reporting on case involving sexual violence given the severity of the social condemnation of such offence locally the second article moreover had repeatedly mentioned mr b by his name and the initial of his surname which had made his identification easy for anyone interested also mr b could not be considered a a public official and hence someone who would have had to endure stronger and more provocative criticism since he had merely been an employee of the city of kragujevac and the head of a municipal branch office at the material time see paragraph above in any event the two article had had nothing to do with the official performance of his duty finally the government argued that the amount of compensation which had been awarded to mr b had not been disproportionate given that it had amounted to le than one average gross monthly salary in kragujevac at the relevant time see paragraph above the court assessmenta existence of an interference it is not disputed between the party that the final civil judgment rendered against the applicant a a journalist and an editorinchief by the kragujevac appeal court on april amounted to an interference by a public authority with his right to freedom of expression see paragraph above see also mutatis mutandis lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc no and and echr iv orban and others v france no january with further reference and gutiérrez suárez v spain no and june a regard the situation of author a well a publisher publication director and editor responsible for their publication such an interference will infringe the convention unless it satisfies the requirement of paragraph of article it must therefore be determined whether it wa prescribed by law pursued one or more of the legitimate aim set out in that paragraph and wa necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve those aimsb whether the interference wa prescribed by law the court note that the legal base for the adoption of the final civil judgement in question were inter alia the relevant provision of the public information act and the obligation act see paragraph and above the court hold that these provision were both adequately accessible and foreseeable that is to say that they were formulated with sufficient precision to enable an individual if need be with appropriate advice to regulate his or her conduct see for example and among many other authority the sunday time v the united kingdom no april series a no and karácsony and others v hungary gc no and may see also in the serbian context tešić v serbia no and february the court therefore concludes that the interference at issue wa prescribed by law within the meaning of article of the conventionc whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim in agreement with the position of the domestic court the government argued that the interference in question had pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation or right of others the court find no reason to hold otherwise and accepts therefore that the interference with the applicant freedom of expression pursued one of the legitimate aim envisaged under article of the conventiond necessary in a democratic societyi general principle the court refers to the general principle for assessing the necessity of an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression a set out in morice v france gc no echr bédat v switzerland gc no march and medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june the court ha also held in numerous case that a lack of relevant and sufficient reasoning on the part of the national court or a failure to consider the applicable standard in assessing the interference in question will entail a violation of article see among many other authority scharsach and news verlagsgesellschaft v austria no echr xi uj v hungary no and july and mariya alekhina and others v russia no july it should furthermore be reiterated that the right to protection of reputation is a right which is guaranteed under article of the convention a part of the right to respect for private life see for instance denisov v ukraine gc no september in order for article to come into play an attack on a person reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be carried out in a manner causing prejudice to the personal enjoyment of one right to respect for his or her private life see axel springer ag v germany gc no february medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above and beizaras and levickas v lithuania no january in instance where in accordance with the criterion set out above the interest of the protection of the reputation or right of others bring article into play the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authority struck a fair balance when protecting the two value guaranteed by the convention namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above the general principle applicable to the balancing of these right were first set out in von hannover v germany no gc no and echr and axel springer ag cited above then restated in more detail in couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no echr extract and more recently summarised in medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above lastly the court ha held that the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity and scope of any interference in the freedom of expression protected by article of the convention where the national authority have weighed up the interest at stake in compliance with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw strong reason are required if it is to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see bédat cited above with further reference the relevant criterion when it come to the balancing exercise between the right protected under article and article of the convention include a the contribution made by the article in question to a debate of public interest b how well known is the person concerned and what is the subject of the report c the conduct of the person concerned prior to the publication of the article d the method of obtaining the information and it veracity e the content form and consequence of the publication and f the severity of the sanction imposed see for example axel springer ag cited above and milisavljević v serbia no april of course some of the above criterion may have more or le relevance given the particular circumstance of a given case see satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june and other relevant criterion may also be taken into account depending on the situation see axel springer se and rtl television gmb h v germany no september ii application of these principle to the present case in assessing the relevant statement contained in the two published article and the reason given in the domestic civil court judgment to justify the interference with the applicant freedom of expression the court find the following issue of particular relevance having regard to the criterion identified in paragraph above whether the statement in question made a contribution to a debate of public interest whether mr b can be considered a public figure the method of obtaining information on the part of the applicant and his publication a well a the content form and veracity of the information contained in the article and lastly the consequence of the publication of the article in respect of mr b and the severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant himselfα whether the article made a contribution to a debate of public interest the public interest ordinarily relates to matter which affect the public to such an extent that it may legitimately take an interest in them which attract it attention or which concern it to a significant degree especially in that they affect the wellbeing of citizen or the life of the community see among others satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above the court ha furthermore recognised the existence of such an interest for example when the publication in question concerned information on criminal proceeding in general see dupuis and others v france no june and july and sarl libération v france no echr extract or information regarding a specific criminal case see white v sweden no september and egeland and hanseid v norway no april with this in mind the court considers that the two published article in the present case clearly concerned an incident of public interest referring a they did to an alleged sexual assault on an underaged romani girl and the very serious charge subsequently brought against mr b in this connectionβ whether mr b can be considered a public figure the court reiterates that a distinction ha to be made between private individual and person acting in a public context a political or public figure accordingly whilst a private individual unknown to the public may claim particular protection of his or her right to private life the same is not true of public figure see minelli v switzerland dec no june petrenco v moldova no march and milisavljević cited above in respect of whom the limit of critical comment are wider a they are inevitably and knowingly exposed to public scrutiny and must therefore display a particularly high degree of tolerance see kuliś v poland no march ayhan erdoğan v turkey no january and milisavljević cited above a regard state body and civil servant the court ha held that when acting in an official capacity they too are in some circumstance subject to wider limit of acceptable criticism than private individual see for example lombardo and others v malta no april and romanenko and others v russia no october however it can not be said that civil servant knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent to which politician do and should therefore be treated on an equal footing with the latter when it come to the criticism of their action see mutatis mutandis janowski v poland gc no echr i see also nikula v finland no echr ii and mariapori v finland no july in view of the above and quite apart from the party different view on whether mr b should be deemed a public figure within the meaning of the court case law under article of the convention the court note that the published article in question concerned an incident in which mr b had been alleged to have committed a sexual assault and not claim to the effect that he had somehow inappropriately or unlawfully carried out any of his official duty in his capacity a a civil servant ie a head of a municipal branch office in these specific circumstance it can not be said that in the context of seeking redress for the violation of his reputation mr b should have shown a greater degree of tolerance than a private individual in a similar situationγ the method of obtaining information and the content form and veracity of the information contained in the article the court would stress that in the context of freedom of expression it draw a distinction between statement of fact and value judgment the existence of fact can be demonstrated whereas the truth of value judgment is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article however where a statement amount to a value judgment the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement if there is not that value judgment may prove excessive in order to distinguish between a factual allegation and a value judgment it is necessary to take account of the circumstance of the case and the general tone of the remark bearing in mind that assertion about matter of public interest may on that basis constitute value judgment rather than statement of fact see for instance morice cited above with further reference regard must also be had in the court view to the special role of the judiciary in society in particular it is inconceivable that there should be no prior or contemporaneous discussion of the subject matter of trial be it in specialised journal in the general press or amongst the public at large not only do the medium have the task of imparting such information and idea the public also ha a right to receive them however consideration must be given to everyones right to a fair hearing a secured under article of the convention which in criminal matter includes the right to an impartial tribunal and the right to the presumption of innocence a the court ha repeatedly emphasised this must be borne in mind by journalist when commenting on pending criminal proceeding since the limit of permissible comment may not extend to statement which are likely to prejudice whether intentionally or not the chance of a person receiving a fair trial or to undermine the confidence of the public in the role of the court in the administration of criminal justice see bédat cited above with further reference being mindful of the above and a regard the present case the court note that the applicant and the news magazine were ultimately informed of the alleged incident and the related procedural development by the police themselves see paragraph and above furthermore the civil court properly established that the first article had stated a fact that mr b had committed a number of crime despite it having been known that the criminal proceeding against him were still pending thereby ignoring his right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty see for example axel springer se and rtl television gmb h cited above bédat cited above and ruokanen and others v finland no and april also it contained an incorrect statement of fact in so far a it reported that mr b had committed the crime of attempted rape even though the news magazine itself wa in possession of information that the police had not even pressed charge against him for this particular offence see paragraph and above concerning both article the kragujevac appeal court also quite rightly in the court view added that while there had been an interest on the part of the public to be informed of the alleged incident this had to be done in an appropriate manner and moreover a regard the second article only that despite the more accurate text just below it the article title had stated that mr b had in fact attempted to rape an underaged girl see paragraph above also compare to and contrast with for example tešić cited above and in that order where the applicant did not explicitly disregard the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty but stated merely that her former lawyer had deliberately failed to represent her properly in a pending civil suit a confirmed by a subsequent police investigation furthermore the applicant allegation in the present case involving sexual abuse a they did were of a much more serious and sensitive nature it follows therefore that a suggested by the government in their observation the domestic civil court had not ruled against the applicant based on any negative value judgment expressed in the article but because of the publication of inaccurate statement of fact see mutatis mutandis egill einarsson v iceland no ab initio november where the court held inter alia that the objective and factual nature of the term rapist when viewed on it face did not justify the conclusion that the statement in question constituted a value judgment rather than a statement of fact despite then going into an analysis even assuming that the opposite were the case moreover while restricting an applicant right to criticise the action of public power by imposing an obligation to accurately respect the legal definition of a given crime might generally speaking disproportionally undermine his or her right to freedom of expression in the specific circumstance of the present case the applicant a indeed any average citizen too should have been able to make a common sense distinction between such sensitive yet very different phrase a attempted to rape stated a fact on the one hand and for example suspected of having attempted to rape on the other compare and contrast to toranzo gomez v spain no november lastly the second article mentioned mr b by his name and the initial of his surname which made his identification easy for person locally it being common knowledge that mr b wa the head of a specific municipal branch office near kragujevac at the material time see paragraph aboveδ the consequence of the publication of the two article in respect of mr b and the severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant a already noted above the right to protection of reputation is a right which is guaranteed under article of the convention a part of the right to respect for private life see paragraph and above furthermore the nature and severity of the sanction imposed is a matter of particular importance in assessing the proportionality of the interference under article see paragraph above the amount of any compensation awarded must likewise bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the moral injury suffered by the plaintiff in question see tolstoy miloslavsky v the united kingdom july series a no b see also tešić cited above in view of the foregoing and given the nature of the criminal charge brought against mr b a well a it own conclusion set out in paragraph above the court considers that the consequence of the publication of the article in question were clearly sufficiently serious so a to attract the protection of article in respect of mr b reputation see paragraph and above at the same time however the final civil court judgment rendered against the applicant ordering him inter alia to pay an rsd equivalent of approximately eur for the mental anguish suffered and the cost incurred plus statutory interest can not be deemed a severe in itself particularly given that the amount awarded to mr b were never enforced against the applicant see paragraph and above also compare and contrast to tešić cited above and ε conclusion in the light of the above consideration the court is of the opinion that the civil court struck a fair balance between the applicant freedom of expression on the one hand and mr b interest in the protection of his reputation on the other and that the reason given in their judgment in this context were both relevant and sufficient furthermore the civil proceeding against the applicant were themselves concluded before the conclusion of the criminal case brought against mr b which wa why the latter could not have been of any relevance for the outcome of former see paragraph and above see also paragraph and in fine above the alleged incident giving rise to the impugned article involved allegation of a particularly serious and sensitive nature in spite of the essential role of the press in a democratic society however paragraph of article doe not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matter of serious public concern see for example bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii and monnat v switzerland no echr x indeed the protection afforded by article of the convention to journalist a well a to editor by implication is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenet of responsible journalism see for example bédat

1,the applicant wa born in and life in weinheim he is a campaigner against abortion and operates an antiabortion website on november and december the applicant distributed leaflet in the immediate vicinity of the medical practice of dr s the leaflet contained inter alia the following text on the front page did you know that dr s full name and address performs abortion that are unlawful according to the caselaw of the federal constitutional court wussten sie schon das dr s abtreibungen durchführt die nach der rechtsprechung de bundesverfassungsgerichts rechtswidrig sind underneath the following wa in smaller type according to international criminal law aggravated murder is the intentional bringingtodeath of an innocent human being sinngemӓβ au den internationalen strafgesetzen mord ist da vorsӓtzliche zu tode bringen eines unschuldigen menschen the back side of the folded leaflet contained the following text the aggravated murder of human being in auschwitz wa unlawful but the morally degraded n state allowed the aggravated murder of innocent people and did not make it subject to criminal liability die ermordung der menschen in auschwitz war rechtswidrig aber der moralisch verkommene nsstaat hatte den mord an den unschuldigen menschen erlaubt und nicht unter strafe gestellt the applicant further quoted part of the federal constitutional court leading judgment of may bverf ge see paragraph below with regard to abortion and a statement by christoph wilhelm hufeland the personal physician of goethe and schiller he also cited section of the conflict in pregnancy act see paragraph below and asked reader to make use of their influence on those performing and assisting in abortion by a letter of december dr s requested that the applicant sign a declaration to cease and desist the applicant refused and published the following statement on his website if dr s full name by carrying out abortion publicly show that he agrees with abortion then he should stand by his opinion instead dr s considers the leaflet campaign to be slander threatens an interim injunction and ha already given his lawyer a mandate to lodge a criminal complaint for defamationslander we ask ourselves is dr s unprincipled and characterless wenn dr s mit der durchführung von abtreibungen öffentlich bekundet das er für abtreibungen ist dann sollte er auch dazu stehen stattdessen sieht dr s in der flugblatt verteilaktion eine rufmordkampagne droht mit einer einstweiligen verfügung und hat bereits seinem rechtsanwalt die vollmacht gegeben eine strafanzeige wegen beleidigung verleumdung zu erwirken wir fragen un ist dr s stand und charakterlos subsequently dr s applied to the karlsruhe regional court for a civil injunction ordering the applicant not to claim on the internet that the plaintiff performed unlawful abortion and not to disseminate leaflet containing his name and the assertion that unlawful abortion were performed in his medical practice he also lodged a claim for nonpecuniary damage in the amount of euro eur and for pretrial legal fee on september the date of the oral hearing before the karlsruhe regional court the applicant distributed a second leaflet directly in front of dr s practice among other place the applicant deposited this second leaflet in which dr s wa not mentioned by name into letterboxes in the immediate vicinity of the latter practice the following sentence wa on the front side of the leaflet near you unlawful abortion and you are silent about the aggravated murder of our child in ihrer nähe rechtswidrige abtreibungen und sie schweigen zum mord an unseren kindern emphasis in original the back of the folded leaflet contained the following text these prenatal infanticide have meanwhile taken on proportion that bring to mind a new holocaust diese vorgeburtlichen kindstötungen haben mittlerweile ausmaße angenommen welche an einen neuen holocaust erinnern emphasis in original farther down the leaflet read im simply unable to understand that medical personnel and doctor who are supposed to help and save life stoop to take part in aggravated murder noch weniger kann ich verstehen das mediziner und ärzte welche helfen und leben retten sollen sich fürs morden hergeben on november the karlsruhe regional court granted the requested injunction and ordered the applicant to desist from asserting publicly both in writing and orally on the internet a well a on leaflet that the plaintiff performed unlawful abortion in his medical practice in addition the regional court awarded compensation for the pecuniary damage requested by the plaintiff eur and dismissed the claim in respect of nonpecuniary damage the court held that the applicant statement were protected by freedom of expression and contributed to a public debate moreover they had to be classified a statement of fact and a such the information that abortion were unlawful wa in line with the judgment of the constitutional court and not incorrect however when read in conjunction with the whole leaflet the statement had a pillory effect and amounted to a serious interference with dr s personality right which wa not justified by the applicant freedom of expression the court came to this conclusion based on the fact that the applicant had singled out dr s by mentioning him by name and distributing the leaflet in the vicinity of his practice that he had quoted the federal constitutional court judgment only in part and had omitted the part that stated that doctor had not been subject to criminal liability that he had implied by defining aggravated murder that dr s had committed this criminal offence and that he had associated dr s with the holocaust nonetheless in regard to nonpecuniary damage the court concluded that even though the attack on dr s reputation had been grave enough to justify the injunction they had not been sufficiently serious to justify nonpecuniary damage the applicant and dr s appealed against the regional court decision additionally dr s expanded his action to include the second leaflet see paragraph above which subsequently became the subject matter of the judgment of the karlsruhe court of appeal on february the karlsruhe court of appeal confirmed the reasoning of the regional court and in essence dismissed both appeal however it partly modified the regional court judgment concerning the precise wording of the requested injunction it ordered the applicant to desist from asserting in public that dr s performed unlawful abortion in his medical practice and asserting in direct connection to this that aggravated murder is the intentional bringingtodeath of an innocent human being the court of appeal further ordered the applicant to desist from asserting that dr s performed unlawful abortion causing infanticide at the outset it emphasised that the applicant view that abortion should be subject to criminal liability and were not compatible with higherranking law fell within the applicant freedom of expression however the court also noted that the very wording of the applicant statement showed that he labelled abortion a performed by the plaintiff aggravated murder which could not be tolerated neither if the statement were considered statement of fact nor if considered value judgment in the court view the applicant had created an unacceptable pillory effect by singling out the plaintiff who had not given the applicant any reason to do so in that regard the court noted that dr s had not been involved in the public debate about abortion in any way in regard to the second leaflet the court of appeal held that even though dr s had not been mentioned by name it had referred to him a it had been distributed in front of his medical practice and deposited in letterboxes in the vicinity similarly to the first leaflet a not negligible part of the reader would have understood from the leaflet that dr s professional activity had constituted aggravated murder however even if understood in a nonlegal sense the leaflet had made it understood that the applicant had conducted illegal and punishable abortion since the applicant had not clarified that he had only been criticising abortion which were according to the caselaw of the federal constitutional court see paragraph below unlawful but not subject to criminal liability he had exceeded the limit of justifiable criticism a to the claim for damage the court of appeal upheld the firstinstance judgment it also did not grant leave to appeal on point of law on may the federal court of justice refused a request by the applicant for legal aid for his complaint against the denial of leave to appeal on point of law on the ground that the applicant intended appeal on point of law lacked sufficient prospect of success on july the federal constitutional court refused to admit a complaint lodged by the applicant for adjudication for being inadmissible without providing reason no bv r ii relevant domestic law and practice the relevant domestic law and practice have been set out in the court judgment in the case annen no no september the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the injunction ordering him to desist from asserting that dr s performed unlawful abortion in his medical practice had violated his freedom of expression a provided in article of the convention which read in so far a relevant a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or right of others a admissibility the court note that this complaint is neither inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remedy see annen v germany no november nor manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission the applicant argued that the court of appeal desist order had interfered with his freedom of expression without being justified by the protection of the personality right of dr s he submitted that his leaflet had contributed to a public debate and had not personally attacked dr s but had criticised the legal situation in germany under which abortion performed by a doctor within twelve week of conception and following obligatory counselling were considered to be unlawful but were exempt from criminal liability the use of the term aggravated murder did not have to be understood a a legal qualification of dr s professional activity but a critique of the killing of unborn child the applicant further submitted that abortion could be considered aggravated murder in a legal sense since the killing of defenseless unborn baby could be seen a malicious within the meaning of article of the criminal code in any case in the light of his contribution to a public debate of great importance possible interference with doctor personality right had to be justified the government submitted that the injunction by the court of appeal had not violated the applicant freedom of expression the court had carefully weighed the applicant freedom of expression against the right of dr s arising from article of the convention they acknowledged that the applicant had made his statement in the context of the public debate about abortion within the scope of it margin of appreciation the domestic court had come to the compelling conclusion that the statement in the leaflet distributed by the applicant had constituted such a serious violation of dr s personality right a to justify a restriction on the applicant freedom of expression the government further submitted that the domestic court had carried out an extensive analysis of the leaflet discussed various conceivable possibility of interpretation and come to the convincing conclusion that dr s had been pilloried a a supposed lawbreaker based on this conclusion it had issued an injunction which had been limited to the claim that dr s had performed unlawful abortion and had put these within the same context a aggravated murder andor expressly characterising them a infanticide the applicant had not been prohibited from taking a public and very clear stance against abortion and the court of appeal had even emphasised the applicant right protected by freedom of expression to characterise abortion a an injustice moreover he had also not been prohibited per se from personally and sharply criticising abortion provider such a dr s for their activity the court assessment at the outset the court considers and this is not in dispute between the party that the injunction interfered with the applicant freedom of expression had a legal basis and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the right and reputation of dr s it therefore remains to be determined whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society and whether the balancing exercise undertaken by the domestic court wa in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the fundamental principle concerning the question of whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the court caselaw and have recently been summarised a follows see delfi a v estonia gc no june with further referencesi freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society a set forth in article this freedom is subject to exception which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article iii the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact the court further reiterates that the right to protection of reputation is protected by article of the convention a part of the right to respect for private life see chauvy and others v france no echr vi pfeifer v austria no november and polanco torres and movilla polanco v spain no september in order for article to come into play however an attack on a person reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be made in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see a v norway no april axel springer ag v germany gc no february and delfi a cited above in case that concerned allegation of criminal conduct the court also took into account that under article of the convention individual have a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty see among other authority worm v austria august report of judgment and decision v and du roy and malaurie v france no echr x when examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interest of the protection of the reputation or right of others the court may be required to ascertain whether the domestic authority have struck a fair balance when protecting two value guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain case namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see hachette filipacchi associés v france no june mgn limited v the united kingdom no january axel springer ag cited above and delfi a cited above although opinion may differ on the outcome of a judgment where a balancing exercise wa undertaken by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the court would require strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see lillo stenberg and sæther v norway no january with reference to axel springer ag cited above and von hannover v germany no gc no and echr turning to the circumstance of the present case the court observes that while the regional court considered the statement to be statement of fact the court of appeal left this question open a in both case the applicant statement had not been justified it considered that while strictly speaking calling abortion unlawful wa correct the statement read in conjunction with the rest of leaflet could be understood a alleging that dr s professional activity constituted aggravated murder the court reiterates that it ha held in a previous decision see annen v germany dec no march that german law under article a of the criminal code draw a fine line between abortion which are considered to be unlawful but exempt from criminal liability and those abortion which are considered a justified and thus lawful it follows that the applicant statement that the physician performed among others unlawful abortion wa correct from a strictly judicial point of view however having regard to the fact that the applicant primarily addressed his statement to layperson the court accepts that the domestic court also took into account the point of view of a reasonable man with ordinary susceptibility who would assume that the unlawful abortion were forbidden in a stricter sense and subject to criminal liability the court considers that the present case is comparable to the case of annen v germany dec cited above a the leaflet provided no further explanation regarding the fact that doctor providing abortion were exempt from criminal liability under article a of the criminal code in contrast the applicant even reinforced the assumption that the abortion provided by dr s were subject to criminal liability by providing his own definition of aggravated murder in international law in the first leaflet and calling abortion infanticide in the second leaflet the court therefore agrees with the domestic court that when taking into account the leaflet a a whole they could be understood a alleging that dr s professional activity constituted aggravated murder this conclusion is not called into question by the court judgment in the case of annen cited above since in that case the leaflet in question had provided sufficiently clear further explanation according to which the abortion were not subject to criminal liability the court would further reiterate that while the existence of fact can be demonstrated the truth of value judgment is not susceptible of proof however even where a statement amount to a value judgment there must be a sufficient factual basis to support it failing which it will be excessive see jerusalem v austria no echr ii the court note that the applicant ha neither in the domestic proceeding nor before the court submitted any indication that dr s committed aggravated murder or that the abortion performed by him were subject to criminal liability moreover in so far a the applicant argued before the court that abortion could be considered aggravated murder within the meaning of article of the criminal code the court note that there is no evidence for that argument in domestic law or domestic caselaw in contrast article of the criminal code clearly defines abortion that are not exempted from criminal liability under article a of the criminal code in sum the court find that even assuming that the applicant statement were to be considered value judgment there wa not a sufficient factual basis for calling abortion a performed by dr s murder in that regard the court also note that these accusation were not only very serious something reflected in the fact that a conviction for aggravated murder would carry a life sentence but might also incite to hatred and aggression in regard to the seriousness of the sanction imposed on the applicant the court observes that he wa not criminally convicted for slander or ordered to pay damage contrast pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi in addition the injunction wa limited in scope and only prevented the applicant from stating that dr s wa performing unlawful abortion and putting these within the same context a aggravated murder andor expressly characterising them a infanticide in that regard the court note that the applicant wa not per se prohibited from campaigning against abortion or criticising doctor that conducted abortion lastly the court note that the domestic court carried out a detailed analysis of the leaflet and discussed various possibility of interpreting the statement therein it is therefore satisfied that the legal protection received by the applicant at the domestic level wa compatible with the procedural requirement of article of the convention in these circumstance the court concludes that the injunction wa not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued namely the protection of the right and reputation of dr s and that the reason given by the domestic court were relevant and sufficient the interference with the applicant exercise of his right to freedom of expression could therefore reasonably be regarded by the domestic court a necessary in a democratic society there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the complaint concerning article of the convention admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rule of court claudia westerdiek yonko grozev registrar president,,,

responded to the request from l lawyer it informed l that the comment had been removed under the noticeandtakedown obligation and refused the claim for damage c civil proceeding against the applicant company on april l brought a civil suit with the harju county court against the applicant company at the hearing of may the representative of the applicant company submitted inter alia that in case like the bronze night public disorder related to the relocation of the bronze soldier monument in april delfi had removed comment per day also on it own initiative by a judgment of june l claim wa dismissed the county court found that the applicant company responsibility wa excluded under the information society service act infoühiskonna teenuse seadus which wa based on the directive on electronic commerce directive ec of the european parliament and of the council of june on certain legal aspect of information society service in particular electronic commerce in the internal market the court considered that the comment environment in the applicant company news portal wa to be distinguished from the portal journalistic area the administration of the former by the applicant company wa essentially of a mechanical and passive nature the applicant company could not be considered the publisher of the comment nor did it have any obligation to monitor them on october the tallinn court of appeal allowed l appeal it considered that the county court had erred in finding that the applicant company responsibility wa excluded under the information society service act the county court judgment wa quashed and the case referred back to the firstinstance court for new consideration on january the supreme court declined to hear the applicant company appeal on june the harju county court having reexamined the case found for l in accordance with the court of appeal instruction it relied on the obligation act võlaõigusseadus and deemed the information society service act inapplicable it observed that the applicant company had placed a note on it internet site that comment were not edited that it wa prohibited to post comment that were contrary to good practice and that the applicant company reserved to itself the right to remove such comment a system wa put in place whereby user could notify the applicant company of any inappropriate comment however the county court considered that this wa insufficient and did not allow adequate protection for the personality right of others the court found that the applicant company itself wa to be considered the publisher of the comment and it could not avoid responsibility by publishing a disclaimer that it wa not liable for the content of the comment the county court found that the news article itself published in the delfi news portal wa a balanced one a number of comment however were vulgar in form they were humiliating and defamatory and impaired l honour dignity and reputation the comment went beyond justified criticism and amounted to simple insult the court concluded that freedom of expression did not extend to protection of the comment concerned and that l personality right had been violated l wa awarded eek eur in nonpecuniary damage on december the tallinn court of appeal upheld the county court judgment it emphasised that the applicant company had not been required to exercise preliminary control over comment posted on it news portal however having chosen not to do so it should have created some other effective system which would have ensured rapid removal of unlawful comment from the portal the court of appeal considered that the measure taken by the applicant company were insufficient and that it wa contrary to the principle of good faith to place the burden of monitoring the comment on their potential victim the court of appeal rejected the applicant company argument that it responsibility wa excluded on the basis of the information society service act it noted that the applicant company wa not a technical intermediary in respect of the comment and that it activity wa not of a merely technical automatic and passive nature instead it invited user to add comment thus the applicant company wa a provider of content service rather than of technical service on june the supreme court dismissed the applicant company appeal it upheld the court of appeal judgment in substance but partly modified it reasoning the supreme court approved the lower court interpretation of the information society service act and reiterated that an information society service provider falling under that act and the directive on electronic commerce had neither knowledge of nor control over information which wa transmitted or stored by contrast a provider of content service governed the content of information that wa being stored in the present case the applicant company had integrated the comment environment into it news portal and invited user to post comment the number of comment had an effect on the number of visit to the portal and on the applicant company revenue from advertisement published on the portal thus the applicant company had an economic interest in the comment the fact that the applicant company did not write the comment itself did not imply that it had no control over the comment environment it enacted the rule of comment and removed comment if the rule were breached the user on the contrary could not change or delete the comment they had posted they could merely report obscene comment thus the applicant company could determine which comment were published and which not the fact that it made no use of this possibility did not mean that it had no control over the publishing of the comment furthermore the supreme court considered that in the present case both the applicant company and the author of the comment were to be considered publisher of the comment in this context it also referred to the economic interest of an internet portal administrator which made it a publisher a entrepreneur similarly to a publisher of printed medium the supreme court found that the plaintiff wa free to choose against whom to bring the suit and l had chosen to bring the suit against the applicant company the supreme court found that on the basis of it legal obligation to avoid causing damage to other person the applicant company should have prevented clearly unlawful comment from being published furthermore after the comment had been published it had failed to remove them on it own initiative although it must have been aware of their unlawfulness the court had rightly found that the applicant company failure to act had been unlawful d subsequent development according to information posted on october by delfi on it internet portal delfi did not allow person who had posted offensive comment to post a new comment until the commenter had read and accepted the rule of commenting furthermore it wa announced that delfi had set up a team of moderator who carried out followup moderation of comment posted on the portal first of all the moderator reviewed all user notice of inappropriate comment the compliance of comment with the rule of commenting wa monitored a well according to the information published the number of comment posted by delfis reader in august had been delfis moderator had

google france and google ecr i the court of justice of the european union considered that in order to establish whether the liability of a referencing service provider may be limited under article of directive it is necessary to examine whether the role played by that service provider is neutral in the sense that it conduct is merely technical automatic and passive pointing to a lack of knowledge or control of the data which it store article of the directive on electronic commerce must be interpreted a meaning that the rule laid down therein applies to an internet referencing service provider in the event that that service provider ha not played an active role of such a kind a to give it knowledge of or control over the data stored if it ha not played such a role that service provider can not be held liable for the data which it ha stored at the request of an advertiser unless having obtained knowledge of the unlawful nature of those data or of that advertiser activity it failed to act expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the data concerned in a judgment of july case c loréal and others the court of justice of the european union ruled that article of directive wa to be interpreted a applying to the operator of an online marketplace where that operator had not played an active role allowing it to have knowledge or control of the data stored the operator played such a role when it provided assistance which entailed in particular optimising the presentation of the offer for sale in question or promoting them where the operator of the online marketplace had not played such an active role and the service provided fell a a consequence within the scope of article of directive the operator none the le could not in a case which could result in an order to pay damage rely on the exemption from liability provided for under that article if it had been aware of fact or circumstance on the basis of which a diligent economic operator should have realised that

scarlet extended the court of justice of the european union ruled that an injunction may not be made against an internet service provider which required it to install a system for filtering all electronic communication passing via it service in particular those involving the use of peertopeer software which applied indiscriminately to all it customer a a preventive measure exclusively at it expense and for an unlimited period which wa capable of identifying on that provider network the movement of electronic file containing a musical cinematographic or audiovisual work in respect of which the applicant claimed to hold intellectual property right with a view to blocking the transfer of file the sharing of which would infringe copyright the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that holding it liable for the comment posted by the reader of it internet news portal infringed it freedom of expression a provided in article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the government pointed out that according to the applicant company it had been neither the author nor the discloser of the defamatory comment the government noted that if the court shared that view the application wa incompatible ratione materiae with the provision of the convention a the convention did not protect the freedom of expression of a person who wa neither the author nor the discloser the applicant company could not claim to be a victim of a violation of the freedom of expression of person whose comment had been deleted nevertheless the government were of the opinion that in fact the applicant company wa the discloser of the defamatory comment the applicant company disagreed it contended that the obligation imposed on it to maintain a preventive censorship policy over the exercise of freedom of expression of third person also infringed it freedom of expression that is freedom to impart information created and published by third person the court note that the applicant company wa sued for defamation in respect of comment posted on it internet portal it wa deemed to be discloser or publisher the estonian word avaldamaavaldaja mean both disclosediscloser and publishpublisher see for example paragraph and above of the comment along with their author and held liable for it failure to prevent the disclosure of or remove on it own initiative the unlawful comment it wa obliged by the domestic court to pay the plaintiff compensation for nonpecuniary damage he had sustained thus the applicant company wa directly affected by the domestic court decision the court considers that the applicant company grievance relates to freedom of expression and fall within the scope of article of the convention therefore the government objection ha to be dismissed the court further note that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention nor is it inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submissionsa the applicant the applicant company argued that the domestic court had interfered with it freedom of expression right to impart information it submitted that it had been forced to alter it business model completely and compelled to monitor every comment posted on it news portal up to comment a day although certain technical and manual procedure had already been applied prior to the supreme court judgment the scope of that activity and it legal implication had substantially changed a a result of the judgment concerned the applicant company argued that the interference with it freedom of expression had not been prescribed by law it argued that the civil law provision relied on by the supreme court embodied a negative obligation not to publish defamatory information in the applicant company view there wa no obligation in the domestic law for it to premonitor all the content posted by third person the domestic court interpretation of the pertinent legislation had not met the requirement of foreseeability the applicant company further argued that the liability of service provider for the disclosure of third party content wa limited under the eu directive on electronic commerce transposed into the estonian legal order a the information society service act the applicant company accepted that the reputation and right of l had been engaged in the present case however it considered that the author of the comment were liable for the possible infringement of l right holding the applicant company liable pursued no legitimate aim the applicant company argued that the restriction imposed on it freedom of expression wa not necessary in a democratic society it noted that the article published by it had been a balanced one and thus the comment created and published by the commentator had not been provoked or triggered by the deed of the applicant company it argued that it wa sufficient that the personal right of individual were protected by a twolimb system firstly by the noticeandtakedown system operated by the service provider and secondly by the possibility of bringing a claim against the author of the comment referring to the case of google france and google and loréal and others of the court of justice of the european union the applicant company argued that it had not played an active role but had merely stored comment on it server set the term of it service been indirectly remunerated for that service and provided general information to it customer reader commentator the applicant company further referred to the declaration on freedom of communication on the internet and article of the directive on electronic commerce and argued that a host wa not obliged to seek or monitor the hosted material such an overly burdensome obligation wa contrary to freedom of expression and information the fact that the applicant company had acted diligently and implemented various technical and manual procedure to reduce the number of illegal comment from the comment area of it portal should not mean that it wa liable for illegal content posted by third party otherwise host who took no measure whatsoever to eliminate illegal material would be encouraged and diligent host punished in conclusion the applicant company asserted that it had only played a passive role in hosting the comment it had had no active knowledge of the illicit comment nor had it been or should have been aware of the illicit comment before the relevant notice by l after which the applicant company had promptly removed the comment thus the applicant company had acted in accordance with the standard to be observed by a diligent economic operator and it freedom to impart information via the commenting area of it news portal had been disproportionately interfered withb the government the government submitted that delfi continued to be one of the largest internet portal in estonia the article published by it were commented on extensively and people could do so without identifying themselves thus the government rejected the applicant company argument that it had had to change it business model furthermore the government pointed out that the applicant company had also admitted monitoring comment on it own initiative on some occasion even before the proceeding giving rise to the present application the government argued that the obligation to avoid causing harm had a clear basis in law and wa confirmed by comprehensive caselaw see paragraph to above a medium publication wa usually liable for what it published and it liability could not be precluded by a disclaimer published by the applicant company a pursuant to the obligation act an agreement which precluded or restricted liability for damage caused unlawfully wa void pursuant to the domestic law author and owner of medium publication had joint and several liability the government maintained that since the publication of comment wa under the control of the applicant company and in practice delfi also exercised partial control it wa obliged to protect the honour of other person and the restriction concerned had a legitimate aim with regard to the applicant company the government contended that the restriction wa necessary in a democratic society the vulgar insulting and degrading value judgment contained in the comment in the present case had had no reasonable factual basis there wa therefore nothing in the comment which would have required the portal administrator to do any work to check their veracity since delfi had not removed the posted comment on it own initiative and it must have been aware that they were unlawful the estonian court had justly found that delfis omission wa unlawful the disclaimer stating that the comment were not the opinion of the applicant company and that the author of comment were responsible for their content did not preclude the applicant company liability the government argued that placing the obligation to monitor the comment and notify the portal administrator of offensive comment on the possibly injured party wa neither sufficient nor justified such a system did not ensure sufficient protection of the right of third party a proven by the circumstance of the present case any information communicated via the internet spread so quickly that by the time the inappropriate comment were finally deleted the public interest in the given news and the comment posted on it had waned measure taken week or even day later for protecting a person honour were no longer sufficient because offensive or unlawful comment had already reached the public and done their damage since controlling the internet wa an impossible task for an ordinary person the party with control over a specific portal had the duty to take action where necessary to prevent violation of personality right the government noted that estonia had chosen to apply le restrictive civil a opposed to criminal liability in defamation case however even if a court adjudicating a civil case wa able to identify the ip address of a computer and the address where the computer wa located it wa extremely difficult to identify the person who actually wrote the comment thus a delfi did not identify the commentator this made it too difficult for an injured person to have recourse to the civil court against anonymous author of comment furthermore the government considered that the state enacting of a regulation providing for mandatory identification of commentator on an internet portal would constitute an excessive interference thus it wa more suitable and proportionate in civil proceeding to place greater liability joint and several for defamation on a portal owner who provided content service the government pointed out in this context that delfi wa a profitoriented company which had invited visitor to it portal to comment on it article without identifying the author of the comment at the same time the income it earned depended on the advertisement published on the portal which in turn depended on the number of comment the government referred to the domestic court finding that delfi had not acted with the due diligence required in commerce it had not taken measure which would have precluded the risk of violation of other person right at the same time the domestic court had not prescribed to delfi how it should perform it duty leaving this matter for the applicant company and considering that there were various mean of doing this the government argued that the applicant company wa not a hosting service provider for the purpose of the information society service act when publishing comment posted on delfis article a hosting service provider offered merely a data storage service while the stored data their insertion removal and content including ability to remove or change the stored data remained under the control of service user in the delfi commenting environment those commenting lost control of their comment a soon a they had entered them and commenters could not change or delete their comment thus delfi wa not a technical intermediary in respect of comment but a content service provider it deleted and modified comment if needed and had also done so prior to the supreme court judgment playing therefore an active role of such a kind a to give it knowledge of or control over the data relating to the comment to it article the fact that delfi had taken measure to minimise insulting comment for example by screening demonstrated that delfi had actually been aware of it liability the government also pointed out that the comment in question had not attacked the public limited company concerned but a member of it supervisory board personally and could not therefore be justified by the exercise by the press of it role of a public watchdog the comment had resorted to offensive and intemperate language and had gone beyond a generally acceptable degree of exaggeration or provocation they had not stimulated any reasonable public discussion lastly the government considered that the sum the applicant company had been ordered to pay l a compensation for nonpecuniary damage corresponding to eur had not had a chilling effect on the freedom of expression the thirdparty interveners argument the helsinki foundation for human right in warsaw provided an analysis of the polish law concerning the liability related to publication of material on the internet it noted that polish caselaw wa inconsistent in some case news portal had not been held responsible for comment posted by the reader in other case blogowners or forum administrator had been held responsible for thirdparty comment the helsinki foundation reiterated that prior restraint wa a particularly restrictive measure and it also indicated a variety of problem related to the noticeandtakedown procedure which called for more precise regulation the court assessmenta existence of an interference the court note that the focus of the party argument differed a regard the applicant company role in the present case the government were of the opinion that the applicant company wa to be considered the discloser of the defamatory comment whereas the applicant company considered that the comment had been published by third party and the applicant company freedom to impart information had been interfered with see paragraph and above regardless of the exact role to be attributed to the applicant company activity it is not in substance in dispute between the party that the domestic court decision in respect of the applicant company constituted an interference with it freedom of expression guaranteed under article of the convention the court see no reason to hold otherwise see also paragraph above such an interference with the applicant company right to freedom of expression must be prescribed by law have one or more legitimate aim in the light of paragraph of article and be necessary in a democratic societyb lawfulness the court reiterates that a norm can not be regarded a a law within the meaning of article unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct he must be able if need be with appropriate advice to foresee to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstance the consequence which a given action may entail those consequence need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty whilst certainty is desirable it may bring in it train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstance accordingly many law are inevitably couched in term which to a greater or lesser extent are vague and whose interpretation and application are question of practice see for example lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc no and echr iv the court further reiterates that the scope of the notion of foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the text in issue the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed a law may still satisfy the requirement of foreseeability even if the person concerned ha to take appropriate legal advice to ass to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstance the consequence which a given action may entail this is particularly true in relation to person carrying on a professional activity who are used to having to proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation they can on this account be expected to take special care in assessing the risk that such activity entail see lindon otchakovsky laurens and july loc cit with further reference to cantoni v france november report of judgment and decision v and chauvy and others v france no echr vi the court note that in the present case the party opinion differed a to the question whether the interference with the applicant company freedom of expression wa prescribed by law the applicant company argued that the domestic law did not entail a positive obligation to premonitor content posted by third person and that it liability wa limited under the eu directive on electronic commerce the government referred to the pertinent provision of the civil law and domestic caselaw under which medium publication were liable for their publication along with the author a regard the applicant company argument that it liability wa limited under the eu directive on electronic commerce and the information society service act the court note that the domestic court found that the applicant company activity did not fall within the scope of these act the court reiterates in this context that it is not it task to take the place of the domestic court it is primarily for the national authority notably the court to resolve problem of interpretation of domestic legislation the court role is confined to ascertaining whether the effect of such an interpretation are compatible with the convention see among others pérez de rada cavanilles v spain october report of judgment and decision viii the court further note that pursuant to the pertinent provision of the constitution the civil code general principle act and the obligation act see paragraph to above a interpreted and applied by the domestic court the applicant company wa deemed liable for the publication of the defamatory comment although these provision are quite general and lack detail in comparison with for example the information society service act see paragraph above the court is satisfied that they along with the pertinent caselaw made it clear that a medium publisher wa liable for any defamatory statement made in it medium publication the fact that in the present case publication of article and comment on an internet portal wa also found to amount to journalistic activity and the administrator of the portal a an entrepreneur wa deemed to be a publisher can be seen in the court view a application of the existing tort law to a novel area related to new technology compare for example bernh larsen holding a and others v norway no march where the court saw no reason to question the domestic court interpretation according to which legal provision originally conceived in respect of hard copy of document were also deemed to apply to electronically stored document this doe not mean that the provision of the civil law in question did not constitute a sufficiently clear legal basis for the applicant company liability or that gradual clarification of legal rule wa outlawed compare mutatis mutandis radio france and others v france no and echr ii indeed general provision of law can at time make for a better adaptation to changing circumstance than can attempt at detailed regulation see for comparison time newspaper ltd v the united kingdom no and no and and echr where the internet publication rule relied on a rule originally dating from the year and editorial board of pravoye delo and shtekel v ukraine no echr extract where the lack of reference to internet publication in the otherwise quite detailed medium law gave rise to an issue of lawfulness under article of the convention the court accordingly find that a a professional publisher the applicant company must at least have been familiar with the legislation and caselaw and could also have sought legal advice the court observes in this context that the delfi news portal is one of the largest in estonia and also that a degree of notoriety ha been attributable to comment posted in it commenting area thus the court considers that the applicant company wa in a position to ass the risk related to it activity and that it must have been able to foresee to a reasonable degree the consequence which these could entail it therefore find that the interference in issue wa prescribed by law within the meaning of the second paragraph of article of the conventionc legitimate aim the court considers that the restriction of the applicant company freedom of expression pursued a legitimate aim of protecting the reputation and right of others the court ha taken note of the applicant company argument about the liability of the actual author of the comment however in the court view the fact that the actual author were also in principle liable doe not remove the legitimate aim of holding the applicant company liable for any damage to the reputation and right of others the question of whether the applicant company right under article were excessively restricted in the present case by holding it liable for comment written by third party is a question of whether the restriction wa necessary in a democratic society to be dealt with belowd necessary in a democratic societyi general principle the fundamental principle concerning the question whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the court caselaw and have been summarised a follows see among other authority hertel v switzerland august report of judgment and decision vi steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no echr extract and animal defender international v the united kingdom gc no april i freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society a set forth in article this freedom is subject to exception which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article iii the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact furthermore the court reiterates the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society although the press must not overstep certain bound particularly a regard the reputation and right of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information it duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with it obligation and responsibility information and idea on all matter of public interest see jersild v denmark september series a no de haes and gijsels v belgium february report of judgment and decision i and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii in addition the court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also cover possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no and bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above the limit of permissible criticism are narrower in relation to a private citizen than in relation to politician or government see for example castells v spain april series a no incal v turkey june report of judgment and decision iv and tammer v estonia no echr i the court reiterates that the right to protection of reputation is a right which is protected by article of the convention a part of the right to respect for private life see chauvy and others cited above pfeifer v austria no november and polanco torres and movilla polanco v spain no september in order for article to come into play however an attack on a person reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be made in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see a v norway no april and axel springer ag v germany gc no february when examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interest of the protection of the reputation or right of others the court may be required to ascertain whether the domestic authority have struck a fair balance when protecting two value guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain case namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see hachette filipacchi associés v france no june mgn limited v the united kingdom no january and axel springer ag cited above the court ha found that a a matter of principle the right guaranteed under article and deserve equal respect and the outcome of an application should not in principle vary according to whether it ha been lodged with the court under article of the convention by the publisher of an offending article or under article of the convention by the person who ha been the subject of that article accordingly the margin of appreciation should in principle be the same in both case see axel springer ag cited above and von hannover v germany no gc no and echr with further reference to the case of hachette filipacchi associés ici paris cited above timciuc v romania dec no october and mosley v the united kingdom no may the court ha considered that where the right to freedom of expression is being balanced against the right to respect for private life the relevant criterion in the balancing exercise include the following element contribution to a debate of general interest how well known the person concerned is the subject of the report the prior conduct of the person concerned the method of obtaining the information and it veracity the content form and consequence of the publication and the severity of the sanction imposed see axel springer ag cited above and von hannover no cited above ii application of the principle to the present case turning to the present case the court note at the outset that there is no dispute that comment posted by reader in reaction to the news article published on the applicant company internet news portal were of a defamatory nature indeed the applicant company promptly removed the comment once it wa notified by the injured party and described them a infringing and illicit before the court however the party view differ a to whether the applicant company civil liability for the defamatory comment amounted to a disproportionate interference with it freedom of expression in other word the question is whether the applicant company obligation a established by the domestic judicial authority to ensure that comment posted on it internet portal did not infringe the personality right of third person wa in accordance with the guarantee set out in article of the convention in order to resolve this question the court will proceed to analyse in turn a number of factor which it considers to be of importance in the circumstance of the present case firstly the court will examine the context of the comment secondly the measure applied by the applicant company in order to prevent or remove defamatory comment thirdly the liability of the actual author of the comment a an alternative to the applicant company liability and fourthly the consequence of the domestic proceeding for the applicant company the court note that the news article published on the delfi news portal addressed a topic of a certain degree of public interest it discussed a shipping company moving it ferry from one route to another and in doing so breaking the ice at potential location of ice road a a result of which the opening of such road a cheaper and faster connection to the island compared to the company ferry service wa postponed for several week the article itself wa a balanced one a manager of the shipping company wa given the opportunity to provide explanation and the article contained no offensive language indeed the article itself gave rise to no argument about defamation in the domestic proceeding nevertheless the article dealt with the shipping company activity that negatively affected a large number of people therefore the court considers that the applicant company by publishing the article in question could have realised that it might cause negative reaction against the shipping company and it manager and that considering the general reputation of comment on the delfi news portal there wa a higherthanaverage risk that the negative comment could go beyond the boundary of acceptable criticism and reach the level of gratuitous insult or hate speech it also appears that the number of comment posted on the article in question wa above average and indicated a great deal of interest in the matter among the reader and those who posted their comment thus the court concludes that the applicant company wa expected to exercise a degree of caution in the circumstance of the present case in order to avoid being held liable for an infringement of other person reputation a regard the measure applied by the applicant company the court note that in addition to the disclaimer stating that the writer of the comment and not the applicant company were accountable for them and that it wa prohibited to post comment that were contrary to good practice or contained threat insult obscene expression or vulgarity the applicant company had two general mechanism in operation firstly it had an automatic system of deletion of comment based on stem of certain vulgar word secondly it had a noticeandtakedown system in place according to which anyone could notify it of an inappropriate comment by simply clicking on a button designated for that purpose to bring it to the attention of the portal administrator in addition on some occasion the administrator of the portal removed inappropriate comment on their own initiative thus the court considers that the applicant company can not be said to have wholly neglected it duty to avoid causing harm to third party reputation nevertheless it would appear that the automatic wordbased filter used by the applicant company wa relatively easy to circumvent although it may have prevented some of the insult or threat it failed to do so in respect of a number of others thus while there is no reason to doubt it usefulness the court considers that the wordbased filter a such wa insufficient for preventing harm being caused to third person the court ha further had regard to the noticeandtakedown system a used by the applicant company indeed the question of whether by applying this system the applicant company had fulfilled it duty of diligence wa one of the main point of disagreement between the party in the present case the court firstly note that the technical solution related to the delfi portal noticeandtakedown system wa easily accessible and convenient for user there wa no need to take any step other than clicking on a button provided for that purpose there wa no need to formulate reason a to why a comment wa considered inappropriate or to send a letter to the applicant company with the pertinent request although in the present case the interested person did not use the noticeandtakedown feature offered by the applicant company on it website but rather relied on making his claim in writing and sending it by mail this wa his own choice and in any event there is no dispute that the defamatory comment were removed by the applicant company without delay after receipt of the notice nevertheless by that time the comment had already been accessible to the public for six week the court note that in the interested person opinion shared by the domestic court the prior automatic filtering and noticeandtakedown system used by the applicant company did not ensure sufficient protection for the right of third person the domestic court attached importance in this context to the fact that the publication of the news article and making public the reader comment on these article wa part of the applicant company professional activity it wa interested in the number of reader a well a comment on which it advertising revenue depended the court considers this argument pertinent in determining the proportionality of the interference with the applicant company freedom of expression it also find that publishing defamatory comment on a large internet news portal a in the present case implies a wide audience for the comment the court further note that the applicant company and not a person whose reputation could be at stake wa in a position to know about an article to be published to predict the nature of the possible comment prompted by it and above all to take technical or manual measure to prevent defamatory statement from being made public indeed the actual writer of comment could not modify or delete their comment once posted on the delfi news portal only the applicant company had the technical mean to do this thus the court considers that the applicant company exercised a substantial degree of control over the comment published on it portal even if it did not make a much use a it could have done of the full extent of the control at it disposal the court ha also had regard to the fact that the domestic court did not make any order to the applicant company a to how the latter should ensure the protection of third party right leaving the choice to the applicant company thus no specific measure such a a requirement of prior registration of user before they were allowed to post comment monitoring comment by the applicant company before making them public or speedy review of comment after posting to name just a few were imposed on the applicant company the court considers the leeway left to the applicant company in this respect to be an important factor reducing the severity of the interference with it freedom of expression the court ha taken note of the applicant company argument that the affected person could have brought a claim against the actual author of the comment it attache more weight however to the government counterargument that for the purpose of bringing a civil claim it wa very difficult for an individual to establish the identity of the person to be sued indeed for purely technical reason it would appear disproportionate to put the onus of identification of the author of defamatory comment on the injured person in a case like the present one keeping in mind the state positive obligation under article that may involve the adoption of measure designed to secure respect for private life in the sphere of the relation of individual between themselves see von hannover no cited above with further reference the court is not convinced that measure allowing an injured party to bring a claim only against the author of defamatory comment a the applicant company appears to suggest would have in the present case guaranteed effective protection of the injured person right to private life it note that it wa the applicant company choice to allow comment by nonregistered user and that by doing so it must be considered to have assumed a certain responsibility for these comment the court is mindful in this context of the importance of the wish of internet user not to disclose their identity in exercising their freedom of expression at the same time the spread of the internet and the possibility or for some purpose the danger that information once made public will remain public and circulate forever call for caution the ease of disclosure of information on the internet and the substantial amount of information there mean that it is a difficult task to detect defamatory statement and remove them this is so for an internet news portal operator a in the present case but this is an even more onerous task for a potentially injured person who would be le likely to posse resource for continual monitoring of the internet the court considers the latter element an important factor in balancing the right and interest at stake it also refers in this context to the krone verlag no judgment where it found that shifting the defamed person risk to obtain redress for defamation proceeding to the medium company usually in a better financial position than the defamer wa not a such a disproportionate interference with the medium company right to freedom of expression see krone verlag gmb h co kg v austria no no november lastly the court note that the applicant company wa obliged to pay the affected person the equivalent of eur in nonpecuniary damage the court is of the opinion that this sum also taking into account that the applicant company wa a professional operator of one of the largest internet news portal in estonia can by no mean be considered disproportionate to the breach established by the domestic court based on the above element in particular the insulting and threatening nature of the comment the fact that the comment were posted in reaction to an article published by the applicant company in it professionallymanaged news portal run on a commercial basis the insufficiency of the measure taken by the applicant company to avoid damage being caused to other party reputation and to ensure a realistic possibility that the author of the comment will be held liable and the moderate sanction imposed on the applicant company the court considers that in the present case the domestic court finding that the applicant company wa liable for the defamatory comment posted by reader on it internet news portal wa a justified and proportionate restriction on the applicant company right to freedom of expression there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the application admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on october pursuant to rule and of the rule of court andré wampach isabelle berro lefèvre deputy

3,is a newspaper published in baku it ha legal personality under azerbaijani law the second applicant a founder and the editorinchief of khural wa born in and life in baku the applicant were represented by mr e sadigov and mr r hajili lawyer based in baku and strasbourg respectively the government were represented by their agent mr ç əsgərov the fact of the case may be summarised a follows civil defamation proceeding against the first applicant on may an article concerning a wellknown highranking government official the head of the presidential administration mr ramiz mehdiyev rm and his alleged relationship with a prominent azerbaijani poet bakhtiyar vahabzade bv and the exhead of the executive authority in sheki ashraf mammadov am wa published in khural the title of the article wa ramiz mehdiyevs plan to finish bakhtiyar vahabzade why did the head of the presidential administration have to punish the sheki community and the head of it executive authority relevant extract from the article appear in paragraph below mr elchin ugurtaj wa mentioned a the author of the article from the material submitted to the court it is not clear whether the name in question wa that of a real person or a pen name in june rm lodged a civil action against the first applicant with the narimanov district court arguing that the abovementioned article contained false statement damaging his honour dignity and professional reputation rm asked the court to order the first applicant to issue an apology and refutation and to pay azerbaijani manat azn for nonpecuniary damage to be transferred to an orphanage rm argued in particular that the title of the impugned article and certain extract from it were defamatory the extract concerned read a followsi in fact the incident described in an article called mafia and the press published in gundam khabar happened not in one of the district of baku but in sheki the one who wa gravely insulted wa not some ordinary man but bakhtiyar vahabzade a famous azerbaijani poet yes the exhead of executive authority in sheki ashraf mammadov wa given an order by ramiz mehdiyev not to allow bakhtiyar vahabzade being elected and that wa a part of a very serious plan in that manner mehdiyev wanted to gain revenge on bakhtiyar vahabzade who hated him for many yearsii ashraf mammadovs black day began after he had refused to obey ramiz mehdiyevs order no one would forget the wellknown event that had happened in sheki during the parliamentary election yes indeed all of that wa a scheme and both the sheki community and ashraf mammadov had to be punished because ramiz mehdiyev failed to implement his big plan the plan to crush bakhtiyar vahabzade in sheki that is why revenge had to be takeniii it is rumoured that the late president heydar aliyev did not allow the central election commission to annul bakhtiyar vahabzades deputy mandate and thus proved to mehdiyev who had the last word a it is also rumoured that mehdiyev had taken on such initiativeiv bakhtiyar vahabzade became an enemy of ramiz mehdiyev and the latter played the key role in the machine importing harmful idea to azerbaijan and it is now clear that the only reason why bakhtiyar vahabzade wa targeted wa that he wa a turkic nationalist mehdiyev not only insulted bakhtiyar vahabzade but also plotted conspiracy theory against him but none of that succeeded so now mehdiyev is taking revenge on bakhtiyar vahabzade by not perpetuating his name after the latter death according to information submitted by the government the event cited in one of the abovementioned statement see paragraph ii above refer to a riot which had broken out against am in sheki in on july the narimanov district court allowed rms civil action finding the title of the article and the extract from it defamatory the firstinstance court noted in particular that the title and the extract from the article suggested that rm hated bv and that rm had therefore tried without success to prevent his being elected a a member of parliament in had organised the event of in sheki in order to punish am for disobeying had tried to have bvs mandate a an mp called off and had prevented memorialising bv after the latter death furthermore the court noted that those allegation were statement affecting rms reputation and lacking any factual basis that the first applicant had failed to submit any evidence proving those allegation against rm and that the article in question constituted an abuse of the right to freedom of expression the firstinstance court ordered the first applicant to issue an apology and refutation the first applicant wa also ordered to pay azn which at the material time wa equivalent to approximately euro eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage to be transferred to an orphanage a requested by the plaintiff the first applicant appealed arguing that by publishing the article in question it had performed it role of public watchdog reporting on topic of high public interest that rm who wa a wellknown highranking government official should have displayed a greater degree of tolerance of criticism against him that the statement made in the article constituted value judgment and therefore were not susceptible of proof and that the article merely reproduced and commented on information which had been published earlier in gundam khabar gündəm xəbər newspaper in may in an article entitled mafia and the press mafiya və mətbuat the relevant part of the abovementioned article published in gundam khabar had stated the following once an exhead of the executive authority of one of the biggest district in baku told what had happened to him he said that there had been a writer who had lived in that district for many year and had run a a candidate for the parliamentary election sometime before the election ramiz mehdiyev called and ordered me to ensure that another person indicated by him wa elected i wa forced to obey ramiz mehdiyevs order on september the baku court of appeal upheld the judgment of the firstinstance court reiterating the same ground to which the firstinstance court had referred see paragraph above the first applicant lodged a cassation appeal reiterating it earlier complaint on february the supreme court dismissed the appeal a unfounded and upheld the lower court judgment reiterating the same ground to which the lower court had referred further development according to the government the applicant did not publish an apology or refutation or pay the nonpecuniary damage a ordered by the domestic court according to the applicant on october property belonging to the first applicant such a computer printer heating device and telephone wa seized under a decision qərardad given by the narimanov district court on the same day to ensure the payment of the award for nonpecuniary damage in question inter alia according to the applicant after the abovementioned seizure of it belonging khural ceased publication however it appears that it internet version wwwxuralcom ha remained active it is not clear whether the newspaper resumed publication in paper version at a later stage according to an article published on the internet version of khural on december publishing house had refused to publish khural and therefore the first applicant staff decided to publish a new newspaper called asi asi̇ it is not clear whether the plan to publish a new newspaper ever came to fruition relevant legal framework the relevant part of article of the civil code of the civil code provided a follows article protection of honour dignity and business reputation an individual is entitled to obtain by way of a court order a retraction of information harming his or her honour dignity or business reputation disclosing secret relating to his or her private or family life or breaching his or her personal or family inviolability provided that the person who disseminated such information fails to prove that the information wa true the same rule shall also apply in case of incomplete publication of factual information if a a result the honour dignity or business reputation of an individual is harmed if information harming the honour dignity or business reputation of an individual or invading the secrecy of his or her private or family life is disseminated in the mass medium the information shall be retracted in the same mass medium source if the mass medium publish information breaching an individual right and interest protected by law that individual ha the right to publish his or her reply in the same mass medium source in addition to the right to seek a retraction of the information harming his or her honour dignity or business reputation the individual ha the right to claim compensation for damage caused by the dissemination of such information the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that the civil defamation proceeding against the first applicant and the ensuing penalty had been in breach of their right to freedom of expression article of the convention provides everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the first applicant the court note that in so far a the first applicant is concerned this complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible the second applicant the government argued that the second applicant could not claim to be a victim of the alleged breach of article because he had not been a party to the domestic civil defamation proceeding and because the decision of the domestic court had concerned only the right and duty of the first applicant furthermore neither of the two applicant provided any information about the ownership of the first applicant such a for example a document showing that the second applicant had a share if any in the first applicant the government argued therefore that the application wa incompatible ratione persona in the part concerning the second applicant the second applicant argued that he held victim status because he wa a founder and the editorinchief of khural the court note that the word victim in the context of article of the convention denotes the person or person directly or indirectly affected by the alleged violation see sarl du parc d activités de blotzheim v france no july hence article concern not just the direct victim or victim of the alleged violation but also any indirect victim to whom the violation would cause harm or who would have a valid and personal interest in seeing it brought to an end see mutatis mutandis vallianatos and others v greece gc no and echr extract a regard the second applicant in the present case the court observes that he wa not a party to the domestic civil defamation proceeding and his participation in those proceeding wa limited to being a representative of the first applicant the only respondent party in those proceeding wa the first applicant the domestic court decision did not impose any obligation on the second applicant the court note in that regard that the first applicant possessed a legal personality a a registered medium entity and consequently had it own right and responsibility distinct from those of it founder and editorinchief the second applicant compare obukhova v russia dec no december and kumok v ukraine dec no may furthermore the second applicant did not argue that he wa the author of the impugned article and consequently it can not be said that the domestic proceeding affected him a a journalist contrast godlevskiy v russia no october in view of the foregoing consideration the court find that the second applicant can not claim to be a victim of the alleged violation of article this part of the application is thus incompatible ratione persona with the provision of the convention and the protocol thereto within the meaning of article a and must be rejected according to article merit the party submission the first applicant submitted that there had been an unjustified and disproportionate interference with it right to freedom of expression it argued in particular that in publishing the article in question it had been fulfilling it role of public watchdog reporting on issue of high public interest in addition rm whom those statement concerned had been a wellknown highranking government official and in a democratic society therefore he should have displayed a greater degree of tolerance of criticism furthermore the impugned statement set out in the article in question had constituted value judgment and had therefore not been susceptible of proof the article in question had merely reproduced and commented on information which had been disseminated earlier in an article published in gundam khabar newspaper finally the first applicant emphasised that the penalty imposed on it for nonpecuniary damage had been unduly harsh and excessive and had caused it closure the government submitted that the interference with the first applicant right to freedom of expression had been prescribed by law in particular under article of the civil code it pursued a legitimate aim a it had been intended to protect rms reputation and right the government emphasised that the domestic court had carried out an analysis of two conflicting interest in conformity with the principle enshrined in article of the convention and had provided relevant and sufficient reason for their decision the interference had therefore been proportionate and necessary in a democratic society in the domestic proceeding the first applicant had not presented any evidence proving the veracity of the impugned statement a to the alleged harshness and excessiveness of the penalty imposed the government submitted that the first applicant had never raised that complaint before the domestic court the court assessmenta whether there wa an interference the court considers that the judicial decision given in the present case constituted an interference with the first applicant right to freedom of expression the interference will not be justified under the term of article of the convention unless it is prescribed by law pursues one or more of the legitimate aim set out in paragraph of that article and is necessary in a democratic society for the achievement of that aim or those aimsb whether the interference wa lawful and pursued a legitimate aim the court considers that the interference in the present case wa prescribed by law a required by article of the convention namely by article of the civil code see paragraph above the court further accepts that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or right of others within the meaning of article of the convention namely the good name of rmc whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic societyi applicable general principle a provided for in article freedom of expression is subject to exception which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent

jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see among many other authority stoll v switzerland gc no echr v and morice v france gc no echr the court emphasis the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society although it must not overstep certain bound in particular in respect of the reputation and right of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information it duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with it obligation and responsibility information and idea on all matter of public interest thus the national authority margin of appreciation is circumscribed by the interest of democratic society in enabling the press to exercise it vital role of public watchdog not only doe the press have the task of imparting such information and idea the

zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june in it caselaw the court ha identified a number of relevant criterion whereby the right to freedom of expression is balanced against the right to respect for private life including whether the impugned statement contributed to a debate of public interest the degree of notoriety of the person affected and the subject of the publication the context within which the impugned statement were made the content form and consequence of the publication the prior conduct of the person concerned the way in which the information wa obtained and it veracity and the nature and severity of the penalty imposed see among many other authority ibid and von hannover cited above a distinction ha to be made between private individual and individual acting in a public context accordingly whilst a private individual unknown to the public may claim particular protection of his or her right to private life the same is not true of public figure in respect of whom limit of critical comment are wider a they are inevitably and knowingly exposed to public scrutiny and must therefore display a greater degree of tolerance see among many other authority milisavljević v serbia no april and prunea v romania no january no doubt article enables the reputation of others that is to say of all individual to be protected and this protection extends to politician too even when they are not acting in their private capacity but in such case the requirement of such protection have to be weighed in relation to the interest of open discussion of political issue see among many other authority lingens v austria july series a no β principle relevant to the content form and consequence of the publication the court draw a distinction between statement of fact and value judgment the existence of fact can be demonstrated whereas the truth of value judgment is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself however where a statement amount to a value judgment the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement see among many other authority morice cited above a regard value judgment which have been found by the national court to be of a defamatory character the court ass the national court finding on the question whether the language used in the statement wa of an excessive or dispassionate nature whether any intention of defaming or stigmatising the opponent wa disclosed and whether the statement had a sufficient factual basis see do carmo de portugal e castro câmara v portugal no october the court also reiterates that there is little scope under article of

under article in particular it is important for the defendant to be afforded a realistic chance to prove that there wa a sufficient factual basis for his allegation see among many other authority morice cited above a distinction also need to be made according to whether the statement emanate from the journalist or are a quotation of others since punishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statement made by another person in an interview would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matter of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reason for doing so see among many other authority pedersen and baadsgaard cited above in timpul info magazin and anghel v moldova a case in which the domestic court had

emanating from other person or public opinion is also to be protected where they are not completely without foundation see timpul info magazin and anghel v moldova no november δ principle relevant to

a to dissuade the press or others who engage in public debate from taking part in a discussion of matter of legitimate public concern see lewandowska malec v poland no september ii application of the above principle to the present case the court observes that several allegation against rm made in the title see paragraph above and the body see paragraph above of the impugned article formed the basis for the first applicant civil liability for defamation the impugned statement allegation can be summarised a follows a rm displayed animosity against and sought revenge on a prominent azerbaijani poet bv b rm ordered am to interfere in the parliamentary election in sheki in one of the electoral constituency where bv wa standing a a candidate with the aim of preventing the latter from being elected c rm had fomented a riot against am which had happened in sheki in d rm had taken the initiative of annulling bvs mandate a an mp and e rm wa refusing or otherwise impeding the memorialisation of bv after the latter death in the court view those type of allegation of engaging in morally sensitive illegal or even criminal action were capable of damaging rms good name the impugned statement therefore could be seen a attaining a level of seriousness sufficient to cause prejudice to rms reputation protected under article of the convention the court reiterates that in case concerning a conflict between the right to reputation and the right to freedom of expression domestic court hearing defamation claim are expected to perform a balancing exercise between those two right applying the criterion established in the court relevant caselaw see inter alia the caselaw summarised in paragraph above and basing their decision on relevant and sufficient reason where such a balancing exercise ha been undertaken the court would require strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see among others axel springer ag cited above delfi a v estonia gc no echr and medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above and however even though the domestic court in the present case identified the relevant impugned statement a affecting rms reputation and lacking any factual basis and found that the first applicant had failed to submit any evidence regarding the allegation against rm in their examination see paragraph and above they made no reference to the relevant criterion developed in the court caselaw instead they examined the case only in term of domestic civil law without taking into account it convention aspect they failed to examine inter alia whether the impugned statement concerned a matter of public interest take into account the context in which they were made or rms status a a wellknown highranking government official the court reasoning in regard of the content and consequence of the article in question and the factual basis of the information provided in it wa brief they failed to analyse various impugned statement separately and in detail and to establish inter alia whether some of those statement amounted to value judgment and whether the article in question wa based on information which had been published earlier in gundam khabar it thus follows that contrary to the government argument see paragraph above the domestic court failed to carry out the required balancing exercise between the first applicant freedom of expression and rms right and interest under article of the convention since the domestic court did not apply the criterion laid down in the court case law for balancing freedom of expression with the right to reputation the court find that it must carry out the required balancing exercise itself for a similar approach see perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extract and yefimov and youth human right group v russia no and december it will examine the necessity of the interference with the first applicant freedom of expression on the basis of the criterion generally applicable to the dissemination of statement affecting private life by the medium namely whether the article in question contributed to a debate of public interest the degree of notoriety of the person affected the content and form of the impugned statement the way in which the information wa obtained and it veracity and the nature and severity of the penalty imposedα whether the article in question contributed to a debate of public interest and the degree of notoriety of the person affected the impugned statement see the summary in paragraph above made in the article in question could undoubtedly contribute to a debate of public interest because they were about such issue a parliamentary election with the authority thus having a narrow margin of appreciation and the person concerned rm wa a wellknown highranking government official the head of the presidential administration given that rm wa a public figure the limit on acceptable criticism of him were widerβ a to the content and form of the impugned statement the court note that the majority of the impugned statement see the summary in paragraph above set out in the article in question mentioned specific date person and incident the court considers them assertion of fact statement of factual nature contrary to the applicant assertion that they were all value judgment some other statement which were strongly charged with the author subjective feeling and emotion such a those claiming that rm had displayed animosity against bv could be regarded a value judgmentsγ a to the way in which the information wa obtained and it veracity the court observes that the first applicant failed to submit to the domestic court or the court any evidence demonstrating a factual basis for the impugned statement the court take note of the fact that the first applicant a a medium outlet can claim to be vested with a public watchdog function reporting on issue of high public interest however the first applicant wa bound by the article duty and responsibility and therefore had to act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethic of journalism the court doe not accept the first applicant argument that the impugned statement were not susceptible of proof a ha already been noted see paragraph above the majority of the impugned statement constituted assertion of fact and therefore the first applicant had to demonstrate that it had taken care to verify them and ensure that they were true furthermore in respect of those statement which amounted to value judgment the first applicant had to provide a sufficient factual basis during the domestic court proceeding the first applicant wa afforded a realistic chance of demonstrating the effort it had made if any to check the veracity of the impugned allegation constituting assertion of fact and presenting adequate supporting fact for the value judgment set out in the impugned article nevertheless the first applicant did not even attempt to present any evidence in support of the impugned statement a it could have for example by asking the domestic court to summon and question am or other individual nor did the first applicant argue that it failure to present evidence had been due to it need to keep it journalistic source secret the court doe not accept the first applicant argument that the article in question merely reproduced and commented on information which had been published earlier in gundam khabar newspaper namely in an article called mafia and the press the impugned statement can not be regarded a a quotation from the latter article the article published in gundam khabar did not concern am bv or the parliamentary election in sheki and it claimed that rm had interfered with the parliamentary election in baku compare extract in paragraph i and above furthermore the first applicant ha never argued let alone demonstrated that the abovementioned or the other impugned allegation stemmed from interview with specific people such a for example am it appears that all the impugned statement apart from the allegation that rm had taken the initiative of annulling bvs mandate a an mp emanated from the author of the article in question himself see extract in paragraph i ii and iv above or constituted unsubstantiated rumour which were presented to the reader a reliable information see extract in paragraph iii above consequently it can not be held that the first applicant wa merely reporting what others had said about rm and simply omitted to distance itself in view of the foregoing consideration the court concludes that the first applicant failed in it duty and responsibility under article of the convention and failed to show that prior to the publication it had acted in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable informationδ a to the nature and severity of the penalty imposed the first applicant argued before the court that the penalty imposed on it namely the order to pay nonpecuniary damage had been so severe that it had led to it closure the court note in that regard that the domestic court found the first applicant liable in civil defamation proceeding and ordered it inter alia to pay azerbaijani manat azn for nonpecuniary damage which at the material time wa equivalent to approximately euro eur from the material submitted to the court it is clear that the first applicant never complained of the severity of the award before the domestic court nor apparently did the first applicant contest the measure taken to enforce the award see paragraph above the first applicant submitted no document either to the domestic court or to the court detailing it financial situation at the material time in addition the available information concerning the consequence of the penalty for the first applicant is contradictory thus on the one hand it appears that after the measure taken to enforce the award khural ceased publication in paper version according to the first applicant that wa caused by the harsh penalty imposed on it on the other hand it appears that it internet version wwwxuralcom ha remained active and continued publishing article both at the material time and well beyond in fact it appears that the website of the newspaper ha never ceased operation furthermore according to an article published on it website the failure to publish a paper version of khural had been due to the refusal of the publishing house and the first applicant staff attempted to publish a newspaper under a different name see paragraph above consequently the court can not conclude that the award made against the first applicant had undermined it economic foundation and led to it closure a it claimed the court observes that the sanction obviously had to have negative consequence for the first applicant nevertheless the first applicant in the present case failed to demonstrate that the penalty imposed on it had been disproportionateiii conclusion in view of the consideration laid out in paragraph above the court is not satisfied that the domestic court performed the required balancing exercise between the two competing right in the present case the right to reputation and the right to freedom of expression having therefore had to ass the relevant fact itself see in particular paragraph and above the court concludes that the interference with the first applicant right to freedom of expression can not be said to have fallen short of the requirement of necessity in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention the court would stress that the latter conclusion must be seen in the light of the particular circumstance of the present case due regard being had to the need to avoid any impairment of the medias watchdog role accordingly there wa no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimouslydeclares the complaint under article of the convention introduced by the first applicant admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on october pursuant to rule and of the rule of court victor soloveytchik síofra oleary registrar president,,,

informer who supplied the information on the basis of which the whole matter wa disseminated and today a far a we know they are being paid for that i do not yet know how much some or of the amount obtained following this statement a journalist from the daily super express jh commented i am the author of this article jh from super express my question concern the people who inspired me maybe you could tell u something else about these familialfinancial relationship the applicant replied i will reply to you the first complaint will be lodged against you with the court tomorrow after that three more complaint will be lodged on october the rzeczpospolita daily published an article entitled jan bestry i did not commit rape i will sue super express according to this article the super express daily had written that in the s the applicant employment contract had been terminated without notice because he had sexually abused young girl the article went on to say that a few day after publication of this story the tv station tvn reported that the applicant had been convicted in of having assaulted a woman passenger on a train when working a a train conductor the article also mentioned that during an interview with rzeczpospolita the applicant had said the disclosure of these matter is in effect a plot in which super express wa involved the author of the article wa gp who wrote it after interviewing the applicant on the phone according to gp the applicant approved publication of the content of the article and the statement cited in the article were the statement made by the applicant however the applicant denied having spoken to gp or having approved any information for publication in the press article when questioned by the court he said that he had not attempted to have a correction of this article published because he had only found out about it in the course of the judicial proceeding see paragraph below b civil proceeding against the applicant on december the former editorinchief of the super express daily tl and the publisher of the newspaper the company medium express sp z oo lodged a civil claim against the applicant for the protection of their personal right they claimed that the applicant had harmed their good name and credibility by statement he had made at the press conference on october and in the article published by rzeczpospolita on

rzeczpospolita on october using the following wording jan bestry apologises to tl the former editorinchief of the super express daily for unlawful infringement of his personal right namely his good name and professional credibility by alleging in the rzeczpospolita daily in an article published in issue no dated october november under the headline jan bestry i did not commit rape i will sue

regard the plaintiff company medium express sp z oo and to publish these two statement in a particular way on page four of rzeczpospolita the court refused to grant the plaintiff request that the apology also be published in five other daily and on the tvn channel finding that such an order would exceed the severity of the infringement committed by the applicant the court justified it reasoning by finding that the applicant statement referring to a plot in which the super express daily wa involved infringed the plaintiff personal right and at the same time the applicant had not in any way proved the veracity of his allegation both at the time the article wa published and later in the course of the civil proceeding he had failed to demonstrate that the newspaper had in fact been involved in any plot the court concluded that the applicant statement which had been made in public amounted to unverified suspicion and accusation addressed to the newspaper it further observed that the applicant a member of the parliament had a right to criticise socially negative phenomenon guaranteed to him by the polish constitution and by article of the european convention on human right however while enjoying this right he may not overstep the limit of permissible criticism by spreading groundless accusation the court did not find credible the applicant submission at the hearing on may that he had only found out about the rzeczpospolita article in the course of the proceeding the court took the view that having held a press conference the applicant would surely have followed the press article which appeared over the following day concerning the subject matter discussed at the conference the court dismissed the remainder of the claim finding that the statement made by the applicant at the press conference on october could not unambiguously be interpreted a concerning journalist from a specific newspaper because the applicant had not expressly mentioned any journalist or newspaper by name both party appealed against the firstinstance judgment on february the warsaw court of appeal amended the challenged judgment insofar a it additionally ordered the applicant to publish an apology for the statement made during the press conference on october the court examined what wa said in the course of the conference and found that the applicant had initially referred to

editor tomorrow before the end of the week three more complaint will be lodged all complaint concern article in the newspaper discussed after further statement referring to event at the school where the applicant had worked and a statement by the applicant wife the applicant made the statement referred to above see paragraph and which in turn provoked the reaction by jh see paragraph above the court of appeal concluded that although the applicant had not specifically mentioned the name of any journalist or newspaper for the average person it wa clear from the context of the statement

count of slander finding that he had not committed an offence because he had merely made public truthful information concerning a person exercising a public function the court found that jh had collected sufficient evidence to prove the veracity of the information he had published and therefore could not be found guilty of slander the court admitted that a regard the second count of slander jh had published information about a criminal conviction which due to the passage of time had already been removed from the applicant criminal record however it considered that the expunging of the

prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartially of the judiciary a admissibility the government submitted that the applicant had failed to inform the court of the criminal proceeding against him and of the fact that he had been found guilty and convicted they further argued that the information not disclosed to the court lead to the conclusion that the present application is manifestly illfounded they also submitted that the applicant had failed to appeal against the judgment of april by which he had been convicted and therefore had not exhausted the domestic remedy the applicant submitted that the criminal proceeding referred to by the government did not constitute part of the subject matter of the present application his complaint concerned the civil proceeding by which he wa found to have infringed personal right of jh and the company medium express sp z oo assuming that the government submission might be understood a a plea on inadmissibility on the ground of an abuse of the right of individual application under article of the convention the court reiterates that an application may be rejected a abusive under article of the convention among other reason if it wa knowingly based on untrue fact see varbanov v bulgaria no echr x rehak v czech republic dec no may popov v moldova no no january and kérétchachvili v georgia dec no may incomplete and therefore misleading information may also amount to abuse of the right of application especially if the information concern the very core of the case and no sufficient explanation is given for the failure to disclose that information see hüttner v germany dec no june poznanski and others v germany dec no july predescu v romania no december and kowal v poland dec no september in the present case the gist of the government argument doe not actually concern untrue fact allegedly adduced by the applicant before the court the court note that the applicant did not indeed inform the court about his criminal conviction even though it related to the same event which constitute a basis for the civil proceeding complained of it follows that the applicant criminal conviction doe not constitute a part of the present application and a such can not be regarded a concerning the very core of the case the court is therefore of the view that it can not be said that the manner in which the applicant presented his case amount to an abuse of the right of petition it also considers that since the criminal proceeding referred to by the government did not constitute a subject matter of the applicant complaint his application can not be declared inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remedy on the ground that he had failed to appeal against his criminal conviction the court note that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit argument of the partiesa the applicant the applicant submitted that the interference with his freedom of expression had been in breach of article of the convention he argued that the domestic court had failed to take into account that the impugned statement had been made a a form of defence against defamatory allegation contained in the press article published before the conference he further submitted that at the press conference on october he had not mentioned any journalist by name or given the title of any newspaper therefore he should not have been ordered to apologise for the statement he had made there the applicant considered the domestic court finding in this respect arbitrary he continued that by sanctioning him for making his statement the domestic court had failed to strike a fair balance in weighing up his right to freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the convention in this respect he considered that in the present case there had been no element of a pressing social need a regard the nature and severity of the sanction imposed the applicant submitted that the order to publish apology in the press and on the tv channel entailed cost amounting to approximately polish zloty pln approx euro eurb the government the government submitted that the allegation made by the applicant during the press conference amounted to statement of fact rather than to value judgment and that the applicant should therefore have proved the authenticity of the fact he referred to they stressed the domestic court finding that the applicant had failed to prove the veracity of his allegation they also argued that from what wa said during the press conference in question a examined by the domestic court it appeared that the applicant had been referring to the newspaper super express and it journalist even though no particular person had been identified by name they further submitted that at the relevant time the applicant had been a public figure and the matter wa therefore of general public concern however they considered that this could not justify making public untrue information infringing the personal right of others the government concluded that the domestic court had managed to strike a fair balance between the applicant freedom of expression and the need to protect the professional credibility of the press the domestic court reaction wa thus proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued consequently the government invited the court to find no violation of article of the convention in the present case the court assessment it wa not disputed that the court decision in the present case and the sanction imposed on the applicant amounted to an interference with his right to freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the convention such interference wa undoubtedly prescribed by law namely under article and of the civil code the court further accepts that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or right of others namely tl the former editorinchief of the super express daily and the publishing company medium express sp z oo within the meaning of article of the convention accordingly the only outstanding issue is whether the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression wa necessary in a democratic societya the general principle according to the court caselaw freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and is one of the basic precondition for the development thereof and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of the pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society a set forth in article this freedom is subject to exception which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly see among many other authority janowski v poland gc no echr i nilsen and johnsen v norway gc no echr viii the test of necessity in a democratic society requires the court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those delivered by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to deliver the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article see among many other authority perna v italy gc no echr v and cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no echr xi the court task in exercising it supervisory function is not to take the place of the competent domestic court but rather to review under article the decision they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation see fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether or not the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully or in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole including the content of the comment held against the applicant and the context in which he made them see news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i in particular the court must determine whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify the interference were relevant and sufficient and whether the measure taken were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued see chauvy and others v france no echr vi in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority basing themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article see among many other authority zana v turkey judgment of november report of judgment and decision vii pp in addition the fairness of the proceeding the procedural guarantee afforded see mutatis mutandis steel

assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see kyprianou v cyprus gc no echr furthermore the court reiterates that in it practice it ha distinguished between statement of fact and value judgement while the existence of fact can be demonstrated the truth of value judgement is not susceptible of proof where a statement amount to a value judgement the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement since even a value judgement without any factual basis to support it may be excessive see de haes and gijsels v belgium judgment of february report i p and feldek v slovakia no echr viii the court further observes that there is little scope under article of the convention for restriction on political speech or on debate concerning question of public interest see sürek v turkey no gc no echr ivb application of the above principle to the present case in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction the court must look at the impugned interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression in the light of the case a a whole including the content of the statement concerned the context in which they were made and also the particular circumstance of those involved in the instant case the press conference organised by the applicant on october wa his reply to a series of article published earlier in october alleging that he had sexually abused student when working a a teacher see paragraph and above moreover the statement he made in the rzeczpospolita daily of october november were his comment in response to allegation broadcast on the tvn television channel that he had been convicted in the past for having assaulted a woman see paragraph above the court therefore accepts that the applicant wa defending himself against allegation published in the medium in which he wa accused of having committed criminal offence the court note further that in statement made at the press conference and also published in rzeczpospolita the applicant referred to a plot and accused the journalist of taking part in blackmail and writing defamatory article for money see paragraph and above the firstinstance court made a distinction between the press conference and the rzeczpospolita article and found that an infringement of the plaintiff personal right could be attributable to the applicant only a regard the allegation he made in rzeczpospolita the secondinstance court however having examined what wa said during the press conference and assessed the applicant allegation in the light of statement he made earlier at the same conference considered that the statement made at the press conference had also infringed the plaintiff personal right see paragraph and above a regard the categorisation of the applicant statement the court observes that the polish court classified them a statement of fact rather than value judgment and accepts this classification indeed the allegation that there wa blackmail which we were subjected to today we already know which journalist cooperated and with whom in order to obtain money from u under false pretence or those journalist cooperated with the informer who supplied the information on the basis of which the whole matter wa disseminated and today they are being paid for that do amount to statement of fact which are susceptible of proof in this respect the court note that the domestic court examined the circumstance of the case and found that the applicant had failed to prove the veracity of his assertion either at the time of their publication or thereafter in the course of the civil proceeding moreover he wa not table to provide any evidence in support of his statement see paragraph above the court further note that the domestic court recognised the applicant right to freedom of expression however they found that this freedom could not overstep the limit of permissible criticism and did not permit the making of unfounded public statement infringing the personal right of others see paragraph above the court considers that the domestic court thereby recognised that the present case involved a conflict between the right to freedom of expression and the protection of the reputation and right of others and thus carried out the appropriate balancing exercise see mutatis mutandis keller v hungary dec no april cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania cited above von hannover v germany no gc no and echr and axel springer ag v germany gc no february having regard to the above and to the nature of the statement made by the applicant the court see no reason to depart from the domestic court finding that the applicant lacked a sufficient factual basis for the allegation that the newspaper super express and it former editorinchief had been involved in a plot against him and had prepared defamatory article in return for money from their informer the national authority were thus entitled to take the view that there wa a pressing social need to take action under the applicable law in relation to that allegation a regard the fairness of the proceeding and the procedural guarantee afforded the court note that there is nothing in the casefile which would suggest that the rule governing a fair trial were not respected in the present case the applicant wa questioned in person at a hearing and in particular had a chance to defend himself and to present evidence in support of his allegation see paragraph above his case wa examined on the merit by court at two instance and their judgment contain exhaustive and meticulous explanation setting out the reasoning behind their decision the court reiterates that the nature and severity of the sanction imposed are also factor to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference under article of the convention see paragraph above in the instant case the applicant wa sued before the civil court and ordered to publish apology addressed to both plaintiff in the rzeczpospolita daily and on the tvn television channel the court admit that publication of apology on a tv channel must have entailed considerable cost for the applicant see paragraph above it note however that the domestic court directed that the apology should be published in the same mass medium in which the defamatory statement had been made by the applicant see paragraph above and that the regional court dismissed a further request from the plaintiff that the apology be published in several other press title see paragraph above it follows that the publication order corresponded to the scope of the publication of the defamatory statement and that the burden imposed on the applicant wa mitigated by the second instance court the court considers therefore that the manner of publication of the apology did not exceed the margin of discretion accorded to the domestic court having regard to the foregoing the court considers that the domestic court finding against the applicant and the sanction imposed on him were not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and that the reason provided by the domestic court justifying those measure were relevant and sufficient the interference with the applicant exercise of his right to freedom of expression could therefore reasonably be regarded by the national authority a necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation and right of others it follows that there ha been no violation of article of the convention

service to allow him to get physical access and to consult in person the file akteneinsicht a well a to make copy of the document it held regarding several prominent person among whom mr ub a former prime minister of the land of schleswig holstein who had died during the night of to october in the beau rivage hotel in geneva switzerland the applicant specified that he wa interested in particular

blackmailed by such service he relied on section subsection in conjunction with section subsection of the act on the use and preservation of federal archival document gesetz über die nutzung und sicherung von archivgut de bundes bundesarchivgesetz hereinafter federal archive act see paragraph below on article of the basic law and on caselaw of the federal administrative court the applicant did not explain why he needed physical access to the said file on december the foreign intelligence service denied the applicant request the requirement under the federal archive act were not met the document did not date from more than thirty year ago and filing the document with the federal archive for the purpose of shortening the period during which the information wa classified wa not possible a the service still needed the file concerned on march the foreign intelligence service rejected the applicant administrative appeal widerspruch insofar a it concerned the consultation of the file in person the appeal wa illfounded insofar a he sought to rely on section subsection in conjunction with section subsection of the federal archive act the file were held by the foreign intelligence service not by the federal archive and only file older than thirty year that were held by the service could be consulted in accordance with these provision this requirement wa not met a the file at issue relating to ub dated from to the provision concerning a shortening of the period of closure schutzfrist concerned file that were held by the federal archive themselves a well a file which continued to be subject to closure even after the expiry of the thirtyyear period the appeal wa inadmissible insofar a the applicant sought to rely on article of the basic law in order to be allowed to consult the file in person given that no refusal decision on this request which could form the subject of the appeal had been taken yet in this connection the service considered in the applicant favour that the development in the caselaw of the federal administrative court which had found by a leading judgment of february for the first time there to be a right of the press to receive information to be derived directly from article second sentence of the basic law verfassungsunmittelbarer auskunftsanspruch see paragraph below wa to be taken into account however that right wa limited to receiving information auskunftserteilung and did not encompass a right to consult file in person at the same time the foreign intelligence stated that the applicant request to receive information under article of the basic law wa still being processed within the foreign intelligence service it being noted that the federal administrative court judgment of february had been delivered only very recently and that it wa not yet available to the service in writing the service stated that it would separately inform the applicant about it decision on his request to receive information proceeding before the federal administrative court on april the applicant lodged an action with the federal administrative court claiming that he wa entitled to consult the file in person the applicant submitted that the thirtyyear period of closure provided for by the federal archive act aimed at striking a balance between the freedom of information and privacy in the light of the comprehensive publication on the death of ub a prominent politician and continuing suspicion that he wa murdered and that this murder wa covered up by the german authority consideration relating to ubs privacy were clearly outweighed by the interest of the press and the public in the information concerning the circumstance of his death taking into account the role of the press a a public watchdog and the paramount public interest in the information the thirtyyear period of closure wa to be shortened in the present case the applicant added that he wa also entitled to consult the file in person on the basis of article first sentence of the basic law article second sentence of the basic law and article of the basic law see paragraph below he emphasised that the right of the press to receive information may take the form of a right to consult file in person the respondent acknowledged inter alia that the right of the press to receive information from federal agency which derived directly from article second sentence of the basic law may exceptionally consolidate sich verdichten to become a right to consult file in person however the applicant had not made a substantiated submission in this respect neither in the administrative proceeding nor before the federal administrative court and no ground could be discerned for concluding that this exception applied in the present case in particular there were no ground for concluding that the obligation to give access to the information in a complete and truthful manner could only be achieved by way of allowing the applicant to consult the file in person in his reply the applicant submitted in respect of the right of the press to receive information under article second sentence of the basic law that in view of the voluminous scope of the file at issue access to the information in a complete and appropriate manner could only be ensured by allowing him to consult the file in person by judgment of november the federal administrative court rejected the applicant action it found that the applicant could not rely on the federal archive act he could not rely on it section subsection directly because the said file were not archived within the meaning of that provision a they continued to be with the foreign intelligence service not the federal archive section subsection taken in conjunction with section subsection of the federal archive act only applied to file thirty year or older which wa not the case here the foreign intelligence service had credibly substantiated that it file on ub were le old and the applicant had not disputed this a the wording of section subsection of the federal archive act wa unequivocal and not open to any interpretation it wa not possible to shorten that period and subsection in particular did not apply to the thirtyyear period stipulated by subsection the federal administrative court went on to find that the applicant did not have a right to consult in person the file at issue under article first sentence of the basic law the right to information informationsfreiheit guaranteed by that provision did not apply a the file at issue were not publicly available source allgemein zugängliche quellen this right did not entail having information held by the authority made publicly available the federal administrative court held that the applicant did not have a right to consult in person the file under article second sentence of the basic law either referring to it leading judgment of february in other proceeding see paragraph above and below the court reiterated that a right of the press to receive information derived from article second sentence of the basic law directly this right reflected a minimum standard which the legislature which had a wide margin of appreciation and the exclusive prerogative to adopt rule that may accord more weight to one or other of the competing interest must not fall short of it met it limit where the press interest in receiving information wa opposed by legitimate interest of individual or authority the scope of that right did in general encompass neither consulting in person file held by authority nor making copy of such file umfasst grundsätzlich nicht eine aktennutzung durch einsichtnahme in behördenakten oder eine kopie von behördenakten lastly the federal administrative court found that the applicant did not have a right to consult the file in person under article of the basic law no right of the applicant to have his research work supported by being allowed to consult file in person could be derived from that provision the judgment wa served on the applicant counsel on january disclosure of information outside the scope of the proceeding outside the scope of the proceeding at issue the applicant on september four month after he had lodged his action with the federal administrative court see paragraph above relying on the right of the press to receive information

charged with investigating the circumstance of the death of ub it had received certain indication from different source and transmitted these without delay to the competent investigative authority

article inquiry made towards the service correspondence with the competent investigative authority and speaking note for parliament the letter listed twelve indication received by the foreign intelligence service from november onwards all but one of these indication had been transmitted to the competent public prosecutor office the person who had given the one indication which wa not transmitted had been contacted by the prosecution authority several time already at the applicant subsequent request the foreign intelligence service on february provided the applicant with information regarding the date of transmission of the said indication to the competent public prosecutor office the proceeding before the federal constitutional court on february the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint the applicant argued that the federal administrative court had not sufficiently taken his fundamental right guaranteed by article first and second sentence and article of the basic law into account when interpreting the provision of the federal archive act see paragraph and above he further referred to this court caselaw on the right of access to information under article of the convention emphasising the role of the press a a public watchdog the applicant moreover alleged that the federal administrative court had breached his right to be heard by ignoring his submission that it wa not credible that the foreign intelligence service document relating to ub dated from onwards given that ub had died in the applicant did not raise further argument before the federal constitutional court nor did he mention in his constitutional complaint that information on the scope and content of the file held by the foreign intelligence service on ub had been disclosed to him in the meantime see paragraph above on september the federal constitutional court declined to consider the applicant constitutional complaint for adjudication without providing reason no bv r the decision wa served on the applicant counsel on september the applicant subsequent publication on february the applicant published an article in bild in which he reproduced some of the information

consult in person the file held by foreign intelligence service on ub a former prime minister of the land of schleswig holstein who had died in a hotel in geneva switzerland in article of the convention insofar a relevant read a follows article everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the party submissionsa government the government submitted that the complaint wa inadmissible on several ground it wa incompatible ratione materiae with article of the convention the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedy and in any event the complaint wa illfounded given that information on the content of the foreign intelligence service file wa disclosed to the applicant the present application boiled down to the question whether the german authority were obliged in addition to providing access to information by way of disclosure following an agreement reached outside the proceeding at issue to also provide access to the same information through another mean that is by allowing in addition the applicant to consult the file in person the government asserted that there wa no obligation under article of the convention to that effect a the court caselaw provided that there wa no obligation on the state to provide information in a specific form they referred to weber v germany dec no january and consequently no interference with the applicant article right the applicant had furthermore failed to elaborate on his intended publication before the domestic court despite being required to do so and had thus prevented these from assessing whether the publication would address a subject of general importance or only an audience wish for sensationalism or even voyeurism that is to say whether the public interest test wa satisfied they referred to magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no november a regard nonexhaustion of domestic remedy the government submitted that the federal administrative court had examined the applicant request under two separate legal base which were independent of each other the federal archive act and the right of the press to receive information under article second sentence of the basic law and it had advanced different reason for rejecting the applicant action in respect of those two claim in his constitutional complaint however the applicant had exclusively complained about the interpretation of provision of the federal archive act the present application before the court wa inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remedy since he advanced with the exception of certain submission concerning the federal archive act entirely different argument before the court they referred to hoffmann v germany dec no november and wei v germany dec committee no august the applicant claim under article second sentence of the basic law wa rejected by the federal administrative court because of a lack of substantiation why allowing him to consult the file in person wa the only mean to satisfy his information request moreover he had not challenged the federal administrative court finding in respect of that provision in his constitutional complaint the applicant moreover failed to exhaust domestic remedy in respect of a number of submission which he made for the first time before the court notably on his intended publication and the purpose of his information request certain alleged error in the application of the federal archive act a well a the claim that the foreign intelligence service wa obliged to hand the file over to the federal archive in his constitutional complaint the applicant had also not made any submission about the disclosure of information about the content and scope of the file held by the foreign intelligence service on ub even though the first of the two disclosure occurred prior to the service of the federal administrative court judgment and the timelimit for amending his constitutional complaint wa still running at the time of the latter of the two disclosure in their additional observation and submission on just satisfaction the government suggested that the court review whether or not the application ought to be declared inadmissible for abuse of the right of individual application pursuant to article a of the convention a a whole or in part in view of the applicant failure to mention the disclosure of the information on the scope and content of file in his application to the court shortly before lodging the present application the applicant had published an article based on the information thus received which he had also failed to mention in his application the applicant had created a fundamentally misleading impression of the fact of the case by concealing the nature and the scope of the information disclosed to him and the use he had made of itb the applicant the applicant rejected the government submission that he intended to obtain information which he had already received but only through different mean the information he had received in december and february could not replace a consultation of the file in person without being allowed to consult in person the file at issue he a wellknown journalist who had previously published on german history wa unable to perform his role a a public watchdog he wa hindered to adequately inform the public and to contribute to a debate of paramount public interest that is to say on the question whether ub a highranking german politician had committed suicide or had been murdered he argued that he had sufficiently substantiated his request before the domestic court it wa irrelevant that he had not elaborated in the domestic proceeding on the purpose of his information request nor on an intended publication the court assessmenta abuse of the right of application the court reiterates that a failure on the part of an applicant to inform it at the outset of a fact essential for the examination of the case could in principle lead to the application being declared inadmissible for abuse of the right of application within the meaning of article a of the convention in order for the court to reach such a conclusion the misleading information should concern the very core of the case moreover an intention to mislead the court must always be established with sufficient certainty see belošević v croatia dec no december with further reference some of the applicant initial submission notably that he had effectively been denied access to the information that withholding information on which the authority had a monopoly amounted to censorship and that he wa unable to research or report on the topic created the impression that he had not received any information given that the applicant had in fact received information on the scope of the foreign intelligence service file on ub the reason for their creation and their content following an agreement he had reached with the authority in parallel to the proceeding leading to the present application see paragraph above the applicant had indeed concealed important information and created a misleading impression of the fact of the case while the applicant conduct is at least deplorable having regard to the applicant submission that the information he had received could not replace a consultation of the file in person a the two type of access to information did not yield the same information in term of quality and quantity the court considers that it can not be established with sufficient certainty that he intended to mislead the court therefore the court concludes that the applicant failure to inform the court about the information disclosed to him in respect of the foreign intelligence service file on ub did not amount to an abuse of the right of application within the meaning of article a of the conventionb nonexhaustion of domestic remedy the court reiterates that the purpose of the exhaustion rule is to afford a contracting state the opportunity of addressing and thereby preventing or putting right the particular convention violation alleged against it it is true that under the court caselaw it is not always necessary for the convention to be explicitly raised in domestic proceeding provided that the complaint is raised at least in substance this mean that the applicant must raise legal argument to the same or like effect on the basis of domestic law in order to give the national court the opportunity to redress the alleged breach however a the court caselaw bear out to genuinely afford a contracting state the opportunity of preventing or redressing the alleged violation requires taking into account not only the fact but also the applicant legal argument for the purpose of determining whether the complaint submitted to the court ha indeed been raised beforehand in substance before the domestic authority that is because it would be contrary to the subsidiary character of the convention machinery if an applicant ignoring a possible convention argument could rely on some other ground before the national authority for challenging an impugned measure but then lodge an application before the court on the basis of the convention argument see among other authority hanan v germany gc no february throughout the domestic proceeding the applicant consistently requested that he be allowed to consult in person the file on ub held by the foreign intelligence service initially relying exclusively on domestic law and subsequently referring to the court caselaw on article of the convention a well the court considers that he raised the article complaint which he raised before the court at least in substance before the domestic court and thus exhausted domestic remedy a required by article of the convention in respect of his convention complaintc applicability of article of the convention having regard to the government objection a to the applicability of article of the convention the court reiterates that article of the convention doe not confer in general and absolute term on the individual a right of access to information held by a public authority nor oblige the government to impart such information to the individual however such a right or obligation may arise firstly where disclosure of the information ha been imposed by a judicial order which ha gained legal force and secondly in circumstance where access to the information is instrumental for the individual exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression in particular the freedom to receive and impart information and where it denial constitutes an interference with that right magyar helsinki bizottság cited above the court note that the government did not contest the applicant right of access to information on the foreign intelligence service file on ub a such they argued that it did not constitute an interference with the applicant article right that the german authority refused to grant him physical access to the impugned file in addition to having provided him information on the scope and content of those file see paragraph above in these particular circumstance the question whether the desired physical access to the impugned file wa instrumental for the applicant exercise of his right to freedom of expression and hence the question of the applicability of article of the convention is closely linked to the merit of the complaint therefore the court exceptionally decides to examine the question of the applicability of article of the convention together with that pertaining to the existence of interference under this provision on the merit of the present case see studio monitori and others v georgia no and january and centre for democracy and the rule of law v ukraine no march it therefore decides to join the objection to the meritsd conclusion the court further observes that the applicant complaint under article of the convention is neither manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention nor inadmissible on any other ground the complaint must therefore be declared admissible merit the party submissionsa the applicant the applicant asserted that there had been an unjustified interference with his right under article of the convention without being allowed to consult in person the file at issue he a wellknown journalist who had previously published on german history wa unable to perform his role a a public watchdog he wa hindered to adequately inform the public and to contribute to a debate of paramount public interest that is to say on the question whether ub a highranking german politician had committed suicide or had been murdered the death had led to numerous publication and press coverage had played a vital part in starting a public debate the applicant submitted that based on the available information it wa probable that ub had been murdered which led to the question why the respondent authority wa unwilling to show what it knew about the circumstance of the death the matter involved question of the integrity of public official and institution finding out who wa responsible for the possible murder of a highranking politician a possible participation of the authority in it including a possible complicity of the foreign intelligence service and a cover up by government institution it wa irrelevant that he had not elaborated in the domestic proceeding on the purpose of his information request nor on an intended publication a member of the press did not have to reveal this a there may otherwise be a risk of abuse on part of the authority from which access to information wa requested thus far he wa only doing research on circumstance of ubs death and had not decided whether he wanted to publish on the matter a journalist mere interest in being able to do research on a matter wa sufficient to oblige an authority to grant access to such information since the authority had a monopoly on the information concerned the applicant could neither do research nor report on the topic withholding the information thus amounted to censorship there were two step in the assessment firstly whether information wa to be disclosed to the press and secondly whether the press may disclose the information to the public the information he had received in december and february could not replace a consultation of the file in person the two type of access to information at issue did not yield the same information in term of quality and quantity given the volume of the file held by the service some page it wa obvious that the disclosure of information a to the file content wa necessarily selective and incomplete only a fraction of the information would be revealed and there wa a risk that the authority would provide onesided fact conceal embarrassing information and thus prevent the press from reporting on scandal and matter worth reporting in the case of voluminous record on matter of public interest the only appropriate mean of giving access to information wa to allow for the file to be consulted in person if the press were not allowed to consult voluminous file in person this would mean that the press would effectively be denied access to information on complex matter and could not report on these before the domestic court he had invoked the volume of the file a the reason why he needed to consult the file in person he had not been required to substantiate this aspect in more detail the burden of proof wa on the authority the federal administrative court had not rejected his claim under article second sentence of the basic law due to a lack of substantiation but had stated that there wa no right to consult file in person under that provision the applicant argued that the domestic authority had failed to balance the competing interest when interpreting the provision of the federal archive act and rejecting his claim on the sole ground that the thirtyyear period of closure had not lapsed in the present case the interest of the press outweighed those of the federal intelligence service not to give access to the file the only legitimate aim pursued by the service could be the protection of the reputation of the deceased person and of his personal data however these consideration could not justify thwarting an investigation into the circumstance of ubs death his heir also had an interest in learning what had really happened the applicant submitted that the real reason for not allowing him to consult the file in person wa that the foreign intelligence service wa afraid of a scandal along these line he added that it wa not credible that the foreign intelligence service file on ub dated only from onwards in any event the service wa obliged to offer the file to the federal archive since it never claimed that it still needed them if the service retained the file it wa obliged to provide access in a similar manner a the federal archive that is to say by allowing him to consult the file in person a wa the standard practice of the federal archive lastly the applicant submitted that the length of the domestic proceeding had gradually diminished the value of the requested information he did not have a domestic remedy at his disposal to speed up the proceedingsb the government the government emphasised that information on the content of the foreign intelligence service file which he had requested wa disclosed to the applicant he wa not denied access to the desired information and he did not argue that the information disclosed to him wa incorrect or insufficient the government submitted that the present application boiled down to the question whether the german authority were obliged in addition to providing access to information by way of disclosure following an agreement reached outside the proceeding at issue to also provide access to the same information through another mean that is by allowing the applicant to consult the file in person they asserted that there wa no obligation under article of the convention to that effect a the court caselaw provided that there wa no obligation on the state to provide information in a specific form they referred to weber cited above it wa within the margin of appreciation accorded to the domestic authority to refuse the consultation of file in person if access to the same information had already been given by way of disclosure of their content unless the person seeking the information substantiated why consulting the file in person wa the only appropriate mean to satisfy the information request such substantiation requirement for granting access to information in the specific form of allowing for the consultation of file in person did not constitute a disproportionate restriction that rendered such claim ineffective this general approach wa even more pertinent in the present case and constituted an appropriate balancing of interest given that the file at issue were from the outset not destined for the public and inference on the internal organisation and working method of the foreign intelligence service could be drawn if the file were consulted in person in this connection they emphasised that the applicant had not put forward argument why the information that had been disclosed to him wa insufficient and had to be complemented by allowing him to consult the file nor had he explained why the form in which access to the information wa given had a detrimental effect on his interest in obtaining information the federal administrative court which had rendered it judgment after the conclusion of the disclosure agreement had rejected the applicant claim based on article second sentence of the basic law because he had not substantiated why he needed to consult the file in person in addition to the disclosure of the information on the file content that court had not found that the right of the press to receive information under article second sentence of the basic law could never result in a right to consult file in person contrary to the applicant submission rather it had found that such right wa in general not encompassed that is to say that the right of the press to receive information may exceptionally and subject to additional prerequisite consolidate to become a right to consult file a recognised in the caselaw of the domestic court the applicant had not alleged before the federal constitutional court that he had been prevented from making a substantiated submission before the federal administrative court the government added that the authority could not be said to have retained a monopoly on the information at issue a the applicant had received the information he had sought in fact he had published two article based on the information thus received which he had failed to mention before the court against this background it wa not in fact necessary for the applicant exercise of his right to freedom of expression that he also be allowed to consult the file in person they referred to magyar helsinki bizottság cited above given that the two article were published in a newspaper with a large circulation two year after the disclosure of the information the applicant claim that the value of the information sought which in any event concerned a historical event had diminished due to the duration of the proceeding wa not convincing moreover had the applicant not been satisfied with the information disclosed to him in december and february he could have requested additional information to be disclosed and challenged any refusal before the domestic court the applicant had furthermore failed to elaborate on his intended publication before the domestic court despite being required to do so and had thus prevented these from assessing whether the publication would address a subject of general importance or only an audience wish for sensationalism or even voyeurism that is to say whether the public interest test wa satisfied they referred to magyar helsinki bizottság cited above before the court he submitted on the one hand that he had not decided whether to publish on the matter and on the other hand that his request served the interest of informing the public of the fact that the foreign intelligence service potentially may have been involved in the death of ub and that the service wa now seeking to obfuscate this fact he had not raised the latter aspect before the domestic court referring to the drafting history of section of the federal archive act the government submitted that the thirtyyear period of closure provided for by that provision wa a a deliberate choice by the legislature designed a not being subject to proportionality consideration such period of closure wa not arbitrary also bearing in mind the sensitive nature of the information and wa based on a common european standard they referred in particular to france and austria a foreseeing comparable period of closure the applicant claim that the foreign intelligence service no longer needed the file at issue and wa obliged to hand them over to the federal archive earlier wa incorrect and had not been raised by the applicant in the domestic proceeding it had to be borne in mind that the period of closure only concerned the right to use file under the federal archive act the federal archive act wa however not the only legal avenue based on which it wa possible to obtain information and in particular circumstance also to consult file in person a explained such claim could be based on article second sentence of the basic law without the period of closure provided for by the federal archive act being applicable to such claim but the applicant claim on that basis had failed because he had not sufficiently substantiated it the period of closure provided for by the federal archive act wa thus neither prohibitive in term of access to file nor wa it decisive for outcome of the applicant request lastly the government submitted that the form of use of the file under the federal archive act wa at the discretion of the authority concerned section of the regulation on the use of archival document from the federal archive and did not necessarily result in allowing the consultation of the file in person even more so in the present case given that the file at issue were those of an intelligence service which would justify a more restrictive approach than the general practice of the federal archive to allow for a consultation of the file if such form of access wa requested the third party intervener the centre for democracy and rule of law argued in favour of interpreting article of the convention a a right of the press visàvis the authority to be given access to information within adequate time this wa necessary in order to enable the press to effectively fulfil it role a public watchdog in relation of the authority the court assessment the court observes that the circumstance of the present case are particular in that the domestic authority did not reject the applicant request for access to information on the foreign intelligence service file on ub a such rather following the agreement reached on november the foreign intelligence service disclosed information on the content of the file it held on ub to the applicant see paragraph above thereby satisfying his information request at least in part the court reiterates that article of the convention doe not confer in general and absolute term on the individual a right of access to information held by a public authority nor oblige the government to impart such information to the individual such a right or obligation may however arise where access to information is instrumental for the individual exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression in particular the freedom to receive and impart information and where it denial constitutes an interference with that right see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above the question whether this threshold ha been met can ultimately be left open even assuming that physical access to the impugned file wa instrumental for the exercise of the applicant right to freedom of expression and that it denial thus constituted an interference with the applicant article right it wa in any event justified under article of the convention it wa in accordance with the law namely section of the federal archive act see paragraph and above it pursued two legitimate aim foreseen in article of the convention namely the protection of national security and preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence see also šeks v croatia no february and it wa necessary in a democratic society for the reason set out below state enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in the area of national security šeks cited above with further reference and classified file of an intelligence service may in principle legitimately be subject to additional access restriction given that the desired physical access to the file would possibly or even likely also reveal information about the internal functioning and working method of the intelligence service this aspect need to be given due consideration in the proportionality assessment at the same time the concept of national security and public safety should be applied with restraint interpreted restrictively and brought into play only where it ha been shown to be necessary to suppress the release of the information for the purpose of protecting national security and public safety ibid and stoll v switzerland gc no echr v the court ha recognised that it wa not wellequipped to challenge the national authority judgment concerning the existence of national security consideration however even when national security is at stake the concept of lawfulness and the rule of law in a democratic society require that measure affecting fundamental human right must be subject to some form of adversarial proceeding before an independent body competent to review the reason for the decision if there wa no possibility of challenging effectively the executive assertion that national security wa at stake the state authority would be able to encroach arbitrarily on right protected by the convention see šeks cited above and the reference cited therein the court ha further stressed that the fairness of proceeding and the procedural guarantee afforded to the applicant are factor to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see ibid and baka v hungary gc no june in case such a the present one involving national security concern resulting in decision restricting human right the court will therefore scrutinise the national decisionmaking procedure to ensure that it incorporated adequate safeguard to protect the interest of the person concerned see šeks cited above and the reference cited therein the court note that the applicant had access to adversarial proceeding at the administrative level before the foreign intelligence service and subsequently before the federal administrative court with regard to the decisionmaking procedure the court underline that inasmuch a the domestic authority are required to ass the proportionality of a refusal of access on the basis of the element made available to them there is a corresponding requirement on applicant to substantiate the purpose of their request before the domestic authority if need be in the course of the proceeding before the domestic court see mikiashvili and others dec no and january georgian young lawyer association v georgia dec no january centre for democracy and the rule of law dec no march centre for democracy and the rule of law cited above and and studio monitori and others cited above and in this connection the court found that it wa not sufficient that an applicant made an abstract point to the effect that certain information should be made accessible a a matter of general principle of openness see centre for democracy and the rule of law dec cited above and in another case the court found the applicant association statement that the information sought the identity of sanctioned police officer wa of public interest to have been too general and found that the applicant association had failed to clarify why despite information having been made available about the authority response to the incident at issue namely disciplinary proceeding against police officer information about the identity of the sanctioned police officer could be of interest to society a a whole see georgian young lawyer association cited above the court relied on similar consideration in studio monitori and others cited above mikiashvili and others cited above and namazli v azerbaijan dec no and june these consideration which led to the conclusion that article of the convention did not apply to the said information request because the threshold criterion were not met apply a fortiori in the present case where the authority disclosed information about the content of the impugned file to the applicant following his request see paragraph above it wa therefore incumbent on him to substantiate why physical access to the file held by the foreign intelligence service on ub after having been provided with information on their content by that service wa instrumental for the exercise of his right to freedom of expression under article of the convention in his request to the foreign intelligence service the applicant had not explained at all why he needed physical access to the impugned file see paragraph above that service had acknowledged in the proceeding before the federal administrative court that the right of the press to receive information may consolidate to become a right to consult file in person and had pointed out that the applicant had failed to make a substantiated submission in this respect see paragraph above despite being provided with this procedural safeguard the applicant did not respond to this call neither in his further submission before the federal administrative court nor in his subsequent constitutional complaint compare studio monitori and others cited above and contrast with mikiashvili and others cited above and centre for democracy and the rule of law cited above and in both of which the applicant remedied their initial omission to give reason for their request in the subsequent judicial proceeding nor did he allege before the domestic court that he had been prevented from making a substantiated submission see paragraph and above the applicant who limited himself to a general reference to his watchdog role a a journalist to the public interest in the circumstance of ubs death and to the voluminous scope of the file concerned see paragraph and above thus failed to put the domestic authority in a position to engage in the necessary balancing of the competing interest contrast centre for democracy and the rule of law cited above therefore the domestic court can not be reproached for failing to engage in a balancing exercise whether the applicant interest in getting physical access outweighed national security interest in respect of certain document consequently the court can not conclude that the manner in which the domestic authority assessed the applicant request had been fundamentally flawed or devoid of procedural safeguard see mutatis mutandis šeks cited above the court also note that the applicant did not put forward argument that the information that had been disclosed to him wa incorrect in the light of the foregoing the court concludes that the domestic authority did not overstep their margin of appreciation when they rejected the applicant request for physical access to the foreign intelligence service file there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention in view of this conclusion it is not necessary for the court to rule on the government objection see paragraph above alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention about the lack of expedition and the length of the proceeding that provision insofar a relevant read a follows in the determination of his civil right and obligation everyone is entitled to a fair hearing within a reasonable time by a tribunal established by law the government asserted that the complaint wa inadmissible they submitted that the proceeding at issue did firstly not concern a civil right within the meaning of article of the convention the complaint wa hence incompatible ratione materiae secondly the applicant had failed to make use of the relevant domestic remedy section of the court constitution act to complain about the length of the proceeding he had thus not exhausted domestic remedy thirdly he had not either before the domestic court or before the court pointed to any alleged delay in the proceeding in any event the proceeding had not been excessively long the applicant submitted that the proceeding concerned a civil right within the meaning of article of the convention and by their nature called for particular expedition he had not been required to make use of section of the court constitution act a that remedy in his submission exclusively aimed at compensation but not at speeding up pending proceeding even assuming that article of the convention is applicable to the proceeding at issue the court considers that the applicant ha failed to exhaust domestic remedy a required by article of the convention in respect of his complaint about the length of the proceeding he did not make use of the remedy provided for by domestic law in that respect section of the court constitution act see paragraph above to complain about the length of the proceeding nor did he raise an objection of delay before the federal administrative court the purpose of which would have been to serve a a warning to that court and to enable it to expedite the proceeding see paragraph above it follows that the applicant complaint under article of convention must be rejected in accordance with article and of the convention for these reason the courtjoins to the merit the government objection concerning the incompatibility ratione materiae of the applicant complaint with article of the convention and declares by a majority the complaint concerning article of the convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible hold by four vote to three that there ha been no violation of article of the convention hold that it is not necessary to rule on the government abovementioned objection done in english and notified in writing on november pursuant to rule and of the rule of court milan blaško george ravarani registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the following separate opinion are annexed to this judgmenta partly dissenting opinion of judge serghides b dissenting opinion of judge pavli joined by judge ravarani and zünd grmb partly dissenting opinion of judge serghidesi introduction the present judgment see paragraph briefly describes the applicant complaint under article of the convention a being about the government refusal to allow him to gain physical access and to consult in person the file held by the foreign intelligence service on ub a former prime minister of the land of schleswig holstein who died in a hotel in geneva switzerland in however in the application form under the section headed alleged violation the applicant present his complaint in a more general manner rather than simply saying that he wa not given physical access or allowed to consult the relevant file in person his complaint is that he wa not given access to the material information or knowledge held in the archive this not being confined necessarily to the fact of having physical access to the relevant file it is expressed a follows the respondent by not giving access to the material in it possession in the archive violates the applicant sic right to know a well a the freedom of the press in it function a a public watchdog a embodied in art echr there is no justification for withholding the information under art echr therefore the respondent ha a duty to render the information requested the withholding of such information is an interference with the freedom of expression and the press in the form of a right of access to official information in the present matter the respondent is in possession of the information desired there exists no possibility for the applicant to gain such information if not provided by the respondent nonetheless the applicant wa denied access to such knowledge the bnd dismissed the respective request all the legal remedy the applicant lodged with the federal administrative court and the federal constitutional court did not prevail in this respect consequently the applicant ha no possibility to inform himself of the fact nor can he report on them in his capacity a representative of the press hence an interference with article echr ha occurred my disagreement with the judgment concern it conclusion that the applicant failure to inform the court about the information disclosed to him in respect of the foreign intelligence service file on ub did not amount to an abuse of the right of application within the meaning of article a of the convention see paragraph in fine of the judgment and point of it operative provision and consequently it finding that the application is admissible of course my disagreement is not only with that conclusion reached in the judgment but also with the reasoning leading to it see paragraph having regard to the applicant submission that the information he had received could not replace a consultation of the file in person a the two type of access to information did not yield the same information in term of quality and quantity the court considers that it can not be established with sufficient certainty that he the applicant intended to mislead the court finding that the application wa inadmissible for abuse of the right of individual application under article a i would have rejected the application a such under article of the convention i thus voted against point of the operative provision of the judgment which by a majority declared the application admissible however assuming that the application wa in fact admissible and without casting any doubt on my finding regarding inadmissibility i also voted in favour of point of the operative provision finding no violation it may seem inconsistent for a judge who voted for inadmissibility to subsequently vote regarding an operative point dealing with the merit but rule of the rule of court requires this by providing a follows the decision and judgment of the grand chamber and the chamber shall be adopted by a majority of the sitting judge abstention shall not be allowed in final vote on the admissibility and merit of case ii rule article a of the convention a an aspect of the right of individual application and the effective protection of human right in my humble view an abuse of the right of individual application can be considered parasitic in relation to this right and one of it greatest enemy this is so because the concept of abuse must be understood a a harmful exercise of a right of individual application with a purpose other than those for which it is designed the right of individual application which is institutionalised and guaranteed by article of the convention is one of the most significant feature of the convention because without this right the court would be devoid of jurisdiction under article and of the convention to protect the right guaranteed in the convention article a of the convention dealing with admissibility criterion provides that the court shall declare inadmissible any individual application if it considers that the application is an abuse of the right of individual application in my view this rule is one side of the protection of the right to individual application this side of the protection fall on the applicant who are expected not to lodge improper application with the court the other side of the protection of the right of individual application fall on the member state to the convention a stated in paragraph two of article the high contracting party undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this right of course the purpose of the rule in article a is not only to protect the right of individual application but also the process before the court and the court itself in my submission the principle of effectiveness a a norm of international law which is enshrined in convention provision safeguarding human right including article is also enshrined in article a and article of the convention the norm of effectiveness enshrined in article a requires that a petition before the court be considered inadmissible if there is an abuse of the right of individual application and a said above the purpose of this provision is to protect the right of individual application and the substantive right safeguarded by the convention the same principle a a method of interpretation should be followed in interpreting article a in this capacity the principle of effectiveness requires that the text and purpose of the provision in question should be given their fullest weight an individual application can be described a a vehicle through which the right of an applicant safeguarded by the convention can be protected by the court consequently if there is either abuse or obstruction of the right of individual application the effective protection of the right guaranteed by the convention may entirely collapse so the discussion to be followed should be undertaken in the light of the effective protection of individual application and the right concerned thus the right to freedom of expression safeguarded by article a well a the protection of the process before the court and the court itself iii abuse of the right of application the government underlined that the information on the content of the foreign intelligence service file which the applicant had requested had been disclosed to him they further argued that the applicant had not actually been denied access to the desired information and that he had not argued that the information disclosed to him wa incorrect or insufficient rather following the agreement reached on november the foreign intelligence service had disclosed to the applicant certain information on the content of the file it held on ub thereby satisfying his information request at least in part the government in their observation alleged that in filing his application the applicant had failed to disclose to the court that on december and january the german intelligence service bnd had provided him with comprehensive factual information on the content of the document held by the bnd pertaining to ub which he had then used for a newspaper article on the subject published on february shortly before lodging his application on february in fact a is clear from the judgment see paragraph and there wa not just one article but two article published by the applicant in bild based on the information he had received the other wa published on july lastly the government argued that the applicant had created a fundamentally misleading impression of the fact and circumstance around which the present case before the court revolved by entirely concealing the nature and scope of the factual information disclosed to him and the use he had made of that information for a publication the first article appearing just a few day before he lodged his application an application constitutes an abuse of the right of individual application where the applicant ha knowingly presented the fact and circumstance regarding an aspect that is essential for adjudicating the application in an untruthful or incomplete manner the same applies to case where the applicant fails to disclose fact and circumstance of which he wa already aware at the time of lodging the application such a fact and circumstance potentially being significant for the court examination consequently incomplete and therefore misleading information may also amount to an abuse of the right of application especially if the information concern the very core of the case and no sufficient or plausible explanation is given by the applicant for the failure to disclose the relevant information hüttner v germany dec no june an authoritative statement of all the above and containing the necessary component of abuse of the right of application can be found in gross v switzerland gc no september the court reiterates that under this provision article a an application may be rejected a an abuse of the right of individual application if among other reason it wa knowingly based on untrue fact the submission of incomplete and thus misleading information may also amount to an abuse of the right of application especially if the information concern the very core of the case and no sufficient explanation ha been provided for the failure to disclose that information see hüttner v germany dec no june predescu cited above and kowal v poland dec no september the same applies if important new development have occurred during the proceeding before the court and where despite being expressly required to do so by rule former rule of the rule of court the applicant ha failed to disclose that information to the court thereby preventing it from ruling on the case in full knowledge of the fact see centro europa srl and di stefano cited above and miroļubovs and others cited above however even in such case the applicant intention to mislead the court must always be established with sufficient certainty see al nashif v bulgaria no june melnik v ukraine no march nold v germany no june and centro europa srl and di stefano cited above in my humble view the present application constitutes an abuse of the right of individual application within the meaning of article a for the reason which will be explained below the applicant failed to disclose in his application that he had received from the authority relevant and important information relating to his complaint some of which he had used in two article he published by doing so he presented the fact in his application form in an incomplete manner capable of misleading the court the information not disclosed to the court concerned the very core of the case a it wa an essential part of what the applicant wa requesting from the authority and he had thus used it in two article a mentioned above while again failing to inform the court about them there is sufficient certainty of the applicant intention to mislead the court by failing to disclose the relevant and important information he received from the authority he knew that the information he submitted to the court wa incomplete but he nevertheless concealed the fact that he had received such information serious negligence is also sufficient see william a schabas the european convention on human right a commentary oup at p the fact that he wa not satisfied on account of not receiving from the authority all the information he had asked for doe not exempt or excuse him from revealing the information he had received the judgment in paragraph acknowledges that the applicant had indeed concealed important information and created a misleading impression of the fact of the case some of the applicant initial submission notably that he had effectively been denied access to the information that withholding information on which the authority had a monopoly amounted to censorship and that he wa unable to research or report on the topic created the impression that he had not received any information given that the applicant had in fact received information on the scope of the foreign intelligence service file on ub the reason for their creation and their content following an agreement he had reached with the authority in parallel to the proceeding leading to the present application the applicant had indeed concealed important information and created a misleading impression of the fact of the case the same paragraph of the judgment though consistent in acknowledging that the applicant had indeed concealed important information on the scope of his complaint and stating that his conduct is at least deplorable thereby implying an intention to mislead subsequently concludes that such intention can not be established with sufficient certainty in the judgment the lack of sufficient certainty is established after having regard to the applicant submission that the information he had received could not replace a consultation of the file in person a the two type of access to information did not yield the same information in term of quality and quantity see paragraph but for me the fact that the applicant did not receive from the authority the whole of what he had asked for but only a part of it albeit containing important information concerning the core of his complaint which he had also used doe not allow him to conceal this fact so this justification or explanation is not sufficient or plausible lack of a plausible explanation in the submission of the applicant establishes sufficient certainty of his intention to mislead the court in this connection it is also important to note that the applicant complaint in his application form is not limited to a consultation of the file in person see paragraph of this opinion but extends to having access to material and information see also the passage from paragraph of the judgment this fact make the applicant explanation for not revealing the information he received even weaker and lacking in credibility article of the convention safeguarding the right to freedom of expression provides that this right shall include freedom to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier it doe not provide for a right to have access to every file kept by the authority in their totality article in fact doe not confer in general and absolute term on the individual a right of access to information held by a public authority nor doe it oblige the government to impart such information to the individual such a right or obligation may nevertheless arise where access to information is instrumental for the individual exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression in particular the freedom to receive and impart information and where denial constitutes interference with that right see magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no november in his application form the applicant nowhere give even a hint that he received important and relevant information from the authority on the contrary he give exactly the opposite impression ie that he received no information at all in particular under the part of his application dealing with the alleged violation he argues that there is no justification for withholding the information under art echr nonetheless the applicant wa denied access to such knowledge the bnd dismissed the respective request the applicant though relying on the provision of rule b of the rule of court to supplement the information in his application form by appending to it further detail on the fact and the alleged violation of the convention and the relevant argument again made no mention of the information he had received from the authority towards the end of this appendix the applicant observes that the withholding of the requested information in the present matter precludes a moral assessment which is one of the function of the press though the applicant correctly refers to moral assessment a a function of the press there is also a moral element in not abusing the right of individual application and not preventing the court from performing it function and noble mission to correctly apply the convention while having before it all the relevant fact the applicant had a duty towards the court to disclose all the information he wa given by the authority and if this information wa insufficient for him he could have explained why since the information not disclosed wa relevant it wa for the court to decide whether or not it concerned the very core of the case and the applicant had an obligation to include it in his application form the court could simply have rejected the application a noncompliant with rule of the rule of court if it had known about this failure to disclose relevant fact at an earlier stage of the proceeding it is useful to refer to the relevant provision of the rule of court rule provides that an application under article of the convention shall contain all of the information requested in the relevant part of the application form and set out e a concise and legible statement of the fact rule a provides that all of the information referred to in paragraph e to g above that is set out in the relevant part of the application form should be sufficient to enable the court to determine the nature and scope of the application without recourse to any other document this provision refers to the scope of the application and it is to be underlined here that the judgment in paragraph note that the information the applicant received and failed to disclose to the court wa in fact on the scope of the foreign intelligence service file on ub the reason for their creation and their content an important provision of the rule of court concerning the consequence of failing to comply with the requirement of the above provision is rule which provides failure to comply with the requirement set out in paragraph to of this rule will result in the application not being examined by the court unless a the applicant ha provided an adequate explanation for the failure to comply b the application concern a request for an interim measure c the court otherwise directs of it own motion or at the request of an applicant lastly rule provides that applicant shall keep the court informed of any change of address and of all circumstance relevant to the application this provision is also referred to in term of the issue of an abuse of the right of individual application by the passage cited from gross v switzerland cited above that the applicant used the information he received from the authority in two article he published wa something which he should have mentioned in his application a provided in rule in my opinion the proposed finding of an abuse of the right of individual application is the result of the best interpretation and application of the provision of article a to the fact of the present case by following the principle of effectiveness a a norm of international law and a a method of interpretation again in my humble view the finding of the judgment that there ha been no abuse of individual application lack any factual and legal basis and defeat the very purpose of article a iv conclusion in the light of all the above i would have rejected the application based on article of the convention for being inadmissible due to an abuse of the right of individual application and this is something that the court might have done under the said provision at any stage of the proceeding but regrettably did not do so dissenting opinion of judge pavlijoined by judge ravarani and zünd i have voted against the finding of no violation of article in this case apart from the difference of opinion on the outcome my disagreement with the majority extends to certain key finding of fact a well a the methodology that ha been followed to reach this conclusion which risk muddying the water of our developing jurisprudence in this relatively novel field first it is necessary to start with an important factual clarification the respondent government have put forward the misleading argument that the applicant wa not denied access to the desired information and he did not argue that the information disclosed to him wa incorrect or insufficient see paragraph of the judgment i am unable to agree with this submission the applicant requested access to thousand of page of primary source information collected by the german intelligence service in relation to the suspicious death of a senior government official several decade ago what he received from the intelligence service a a result of an outofcourt settlement wa merely a highlevel description of the category of information that the relevant file contained see paragraph of the judgment while such information may be quite useful in certain circumstance perhaps a a preliminary step in narrowing down a wideranging request it is simply not what the applicant asked for it is the equivalent of requesting to read a book and being offered it table of content a a perfectly good alternative the applicant ha never received access to a single page from the original file unfortunately the majority have chosen to gloss over this crucial distinction and to accept that the applicant information request wa satisfied at least in part see paragraph of the judgment this fallacy lay the ground for much of the majority reasoning a second steppingstone to the finding of no violation of article is the majority reluctance to hold that the threshold condition for the applicability of article were clearly met in this case the question of applicability is first joined to the merit see paragraph of the judgment and then ultimately left open presumably on the basis that article doe not necessarily grant a right of physical access to government file see paragraph of the judgment this conclusion is based in my view on a significant misunderstanding of both our existing jurisprudence and the way virtually all access to information regime operate in the european space to begin with the majority timidity would seem to suggest that this is the first time the court ha been faced with such a question a this is not the case in my view there wa no need to question or cast doubt on a wellestablished element of our article caselaw a large number of access to information case decided by various section of the court following the grand chamber groundbreaking magyar helsinki judgment magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no november have dealt specifically with request by applicant for access to original document ie primarysource information held by state authority in none of these case ha it been disputed neither by the respondent government nor by the court that article applies in principle to such request this being a question of the court ratione materiae jurisdiction it ought to have been considered in any event of the court own motion a a result it seems obvious to conclude that the court ha long accepted expressly or implicitly that a right of access to the original file or document held by a government authority is protected in principle by article the majority have chosen to ignore this line of caselaw furthermore the majority approach is at odds with a core and widely accepted conception of the right to information in european comparative law a well a under council of europe standardsetting instrument the primary form of access guaranteed by these law including the german federal access law itself is direct access to primary official document and source irrespective of their format whether a an original complete and authentic paper copy electronic copy and so on this is also a matter of common sense any serious journalist or researcher would want to see the original government data not merely information about the information the metadata or a governmentprepared summary of the requested information the fundamental guarantee of article do not rest on the assumption that the government version of event is always to be trusted any researcher who ha spent time leafing through dusty old record in government archive would testify to that the practice is older than the lost library of alexandria the court itself ha emphasised in a national security context that access to original documentary source for legitimate historical research is an essential element of the exercise of the right to freedom of expression see kenedi v hungary no may thirdly the majority find that article ha not been violated despite the national court manifest failure to engage in any meaningful balancing of the applicant article interest in obtaining access to the original file in whole or in part against any ongoing national security interest in preserving their secrecy the judgment doe so by relying on the applicant supposed failure to sufficiently justify before the domestic authority the need for physical access a such an omission that presumably failed to put the domestic authority in a position to engage in the necessary balancing of the competing interest see paragraph of the judgment in other word the majority like the national court wonder why the applicant could not have been satisfied with having received the table of content rather than the whole book while investigating a complex set of event related to a death under disputed circumstance that had attracted a great deal of public interest in fact this core question is tied to a structural problem in the german access to information regime the intelligence service being entirely exempted from the scope of federal access to information law the only option left to journalist and to journalist exclusively for requesting access to their information is to rely on a complex mix of judgemade constitutional remedy andor landbased legislation the applicant case suggests however that these remedy are imperfect and subject to a high substantive threshold and burden of proof to be met by the requester the right of the press to receive information may consolidate to become a right to consult file in person under certain undefined scenario see paragraph of the judgment these national threshold are arguably stricter and therefore incompatible with the fourfactor threshold set by the court grand chamber in magyar helsinki cited above for article to become applicable the lack of a generalised constitutional basis for the right of access to official information at the german federal level such that it would be commensurate with the level of protection guaranteed by article of the convention is another source of complication this idiosyncratic national legal framework a applicable to the intelligence service in this particular case is hardly compatible with our own established jurisprudence an aspect that the judgment doe not address any national legal framework that shield or exempts entire government agency from the operation of the right of access to government information or that categorically bar requester from access to certain primary source in the absence of any balancing of interest is bound to run into similar convention problem in my view nothing in this separate opinion should be taken of course to suggest that people should be able to roam freely through the intelligence agency archive on the other hand a national security data about historical event of general importance become older or liable to be declassified the interest of historical research and the public right to know become stronger and may tip the balance in favour of disclosure in whole or in part see kenedi cited above involving access to historical record of the hungarian secret service established democracy have developed multiple mechanism to do this without undermining the internal working method or source of the service or other remaining national security concern redaction and partial disclosure being among these standard tool in line with the principle of proportionality had the national authority put forward sound substantive reason a to why national security would have been seriously jeopardised by granting the applicant any degree of access to the physical file and had the national court scrutinised such argument in line with article standard the refusal of physical access in whole or in part might be considered justified conversely the failure of the domestic authority to engage in any meaningful balancing of the substantive interest at stake is sufficient in my view to find a violation of article in this case the majority strictly procedural approach mean that the court itself ha also missed an opportunity to enrich our jurisprudence on question of historical memory in a national security context see among other case cangi v turkey no january studio monitori and others v georgia dec no and january centre for democracy and the rule of law v ukraine dec no march centre for democracy and the rule of law v ukraine no march and leshchenko v ukraine no and january the fact that the relevant article complaint may have been found inadmissible on other ground or with respect to the specific nature of the information being requested see eg studio monitori cited above doe not change this general conclusion see in particular the committee of minister recommendation on access to official document and it explanatory memorandum paragraph and including with reference to confidential secret or top secret document,,,

morally degraded n state allowed the murder of innocent people and did not make it subject to criminal liability die ermordung der menschen in auschwitz war rechtswidrig aber der moralisch verkommene nsstaat hatte den mord an den unschuldigen menschen erlaubt und nicht unter strafe gestellt the applicant also addressed passersby and the physician presumed patient and attempted to engage with them in conversation about abortion dr st lodged an application for a civil injunction against the applicant and on october the mannheim regional court granted the requested injunction the court ordered the applicant to desist from speaking to passersby in the immediate vicinity of the medical practice and labelling the abortion performed by the plaintiff unlawful with the objective of irritating female patient and preventing them from visiting dr sts practice on february the karlsruhe court of appeal upheld the decision and slightly modified the wording specifying the geographical area concerned by the injunction it also refused to grant leave to appeal on point of law the regional court a well a the court of appeal both referred to a previous decision of the federal court of justice in which it had confirmed a civil injunction against similar conduct by the applicant see paragraph below the court held that in the case at issue there were no factual or legal difference justifying deviating from the caselaw of the federal court of justice in so far that the doctor in the present case wa slightly more wellknown than the doctor in the original case the court of appeal held that this wa of minor relevance the fact that dr st had appeared a an expert before the german parliament many year previously did not have any substantial effect on dr sts public profile at that time moreover the involvement of dr st in different legal dispute wa irrelevant a trying to enforce his right in the appropriate legal procedure could not redound to dr sts disadvantage in sum the applicant had vilified the noncriminal professional activity of dr st by implying that he committed criminal act and interfered with the relationship of trust between doctor and patient which deserved special protection against the intervention of others the applicant had therefore severely interfered with dr sts personality right this interference wa not justified by the applicant freedom of expression in view of the massive pillory effect the applicant had created by singling out the plaintiff and criticising him in a harsh way in the immediate vicinity of his practice on may the federal court of justice refused a request by the applicant for legal aid on the ground that the applicant intended appeal on point of law lacked sufficient prospect of success on july the federal constitutional court refused to admit the applicant complaint for adjudication for being inadmissible without providing reason no bv r ii relevant domestic law and practice the relevant provision of the german basic law grundgesetz criminal code strafgesetzbuch and civil code bürgerliches gesetzbuch have been set out in the court judgment in annen no no september in addition on december the federal court of justice confirmed an injunction ordering the applicant to desist from addressing patient and passersby in a specified area in front of a medical practice and from pointing out that in the practice abortion were performed no vi zr it pointed out that the doctor activity were legal and enjoyed protection under his constitutional right to freedom to exercise his profession the court emphasised the important role which the legislature had attributed to gynaecologist both in the protection of unborn life and in the protection of the health of the woman concerned it wa essential that the relationship of trust between the doctor and his patient wa not disturbed by the intrusion of external party the applicant action had adversely affected the plaintiff activity in an unacceptable way and had singled him out without any reason therefore the court concluded that under the circumstance of this particular case the physician personality right prevailed over the applicant freedom of expression a constitutional complaint against the judgment of the federal court of justice wa not admitted for adjudication the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the injunction ordering him to desist from addressing passersby in the immediate vicinity of dr sts medical practice and from labelling the abortion performed by the plaintiff unlawful had violated his freedom of expression a provided in article of the convention which read in so far a relevant a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or right of others a admissibility the court note that this complaint is neither inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remedy see annen v germany no november nor manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission the applicant argued that the desist order had interfered with his freedom of expression without being justified by the protection of the personality right of dr st he submitted that his distribution of leaflet and the intended conversation with passersby had contributed to a public debate of great importance his action had not personally attacked dr st but had criticised the legal situation in germany concerning abortion which had been performed by a doctor within twelve week of conception and following obligatory counseling those abortion had been considered to be unlawful but had been exempt from criminal liability moreover it had been consistent with the caselaw of the federal constitutional court to call abortion a performed by dr st unlawful the applicant further submitted that the domestic court had not sufficiently taken into account that dr st had not been unknown to the public a the doctor had been in the earlier case decided by the federal court of justice but had appeared a an expert before the german parliament and had been involved in several legal dispute in the context of the debate about abortion the government submitted that the interference with the applicant freedom of expression which had been based on article in conjunction with article of the civil code had been necessary to safeguard dr sts personality right a enshrined in article of the convention by calling abortion unlawful the applicant had created the false impression that dr st had been operating outside of the legal framework in performing such procedure unlike the leaflet in the case of annen cited above the leaflet in the present case did not point out that abortion are permitted in germany under the term of article a of the criminal code and therefore not subject to criminal liability moreover given the applicant goal of forced pavement counselling the applicant had severely disturbed the relationship of trust between doctor and patient the court had already rejected an earlier application by the same applicant against a desist order against similar conduct see annen v germany dec no march in the present case the domestic court had relied on the judgment of the federal court of justice which had been the subject matter of the earlier inadmissibility decision of the court and concluded that the circumstance had been comparable and had not warranted deviating from the existing caselaw when coming to that conclusion the domestic court had paid attention to the fact that dr st had taken a public position in the abortion debate the court assessment at the outset the court considers and this is not in dispute between the party that the injunction interfered with the applicant freedom of expression had a legal basis and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the right and reputation of dr st a well a the right of patient to medical counseling it therefore remains to be determined whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society and whether the balancing exercise undertaken by the domestic court wa in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the fundamental principle concerning the question of whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the court caselaw and have recently been summarised a follows see delfi a v estonia gc no june with further referencesi freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society a set forth in article this freedom is subject to exception which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article iii the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact the court further reiterates that the right to protection of reputation is protected by article of the convention a part of the right to respect for private life see chauvy and others v france no echr vi pfeifer v austria no november and polanco torres and movilla polanco v spain no september in order for article to come into play however an attack on a person reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be made in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see a v norway no april axel springer ag v germany gc no february and delfi a cited above in case that concerned allegation of criminal conduct the court also took into account that under article of the convention individual have a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty see among other authority worm v austria august report of judgment and decision v and du roy and malaurie v france no echr x when examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interest of the protection of the reputation or right of others the court may be required to ascertain whether the domestic authority have struck a fair balance when protecting two value guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain case namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see hachette filipacchi associés v france no june mgn limited v the united kingdom no january axel springer ag cited above and delfi a cited above turning to the circumstance of the present case the court observes that the domestic court justified the injunction by in essence three point that interfered with the doctor private and professional life and taken together reached a severity that dr st should not have had to endure firstly the applicant had vilified dr st by implying that he had committed criminal act secondly he had singled out dr st from all doctor that had performed abortion and had thereby created a pillory effect and lastly the applicant had interfered with the particularly protected relationship of trust between dr st and his patient in regard to the first aspect the court reiterates that it ha held in a previous decision see annen v germany dec no march that german law under article a of the criminal code draw a fine line between abortion which are considered to be unlawful but exempt from criminal liability and those abortion which are considered a justified and thus lawful it follows that the applicant statement that the physician performed among others unlawful abortion wa correct from a strictly judicial point of view however having regard to the fact that the applicant primarily addressed his statement to layperson the court accepts that the domestic court also took into account the point of view of a reasonable man with ordinary susceptibility who would assume that the unlawful abortion were forbidden in a stricter sense and subject to criminal liability this conclusion is not called into question by the court later judgment in the case of annen cited above since in that case the leaflet in question provided sufficiently clear further explanation according to which abortion were not subject to criminal liability the court therefore agrees with the conclusion of the domestic court regarding the first aspect concerning the issue of singling out dr st the court note that the applicant submitted that the former had been known to the public had appeared a an expert before the german parliament and had been involved in several legal dispute in the context of the debate about abortion however the court also take note of the fact that the domestic court considered these point and concluded that they were only of minor relevance the appearance before the german parliament had been many year previous to that time and therefore did not have any substantial effect on dr sts public profile the involvement of dr st in different legal dispute wa irrelevant a trying to enforce his right in the appropriate legal procedure could not redound to dr sts disadvantage the court would reiterate that a distinction ha to be made between private individual and person acting in a public context a political figure or public figure and that a private individual unknown to the public may claim particular protection of his or her right to private life see axel springer ag v germany gc no february with further reference nonetheless having regard to their direct and continuous contact with their society it is primarily for the domestic court to ass how well known a person is especially where that person is mainly known at national level ibid in conclusion the court find the domestic court reasoning that dr sts prior conduct had only minor relevance for the present assessment acceptable and see no reason to call the court conclusion concerning how well known dr st wa into question turning to the issue of the applicant interfering with the relationship of trust between dr st and his patient the court reiterates that it ha already accepted that a civil injunction wa in particular based on the fact that the applicant approached the doctor patient in the direct vicinity of his medical practice and thus seriously disturbed the exercise of his professional activity see annen v germany dec cited above the court observes that such pavement counselling by the applicant which the regional court described a running the gauntlet did not only interfere with the dr sts legal professional activity but also rendered it more difficult for patient to seek medical assistance the court therefore see no reason to deviate from it previous finding in the present case the foregoing consideration are sufficient to enable the court to conclude that the reason advanced for the interference complained of were relevant and sufficient furthermore the court observes that the applicant wa not criminally convicted for slander or ordered to pay damage contrast pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi but only prevented from addressing passersby in the immediate vicinity of dr sts medical practice and from labelling the abortion performed by the plaintiff unlawful consequently the injunction wa limited geographically and in scope in regard to the latter the court note that the applicant wa not per se prohibited from campaigning against abortion criticising doctor that conducted abortion or distributing leaflet in sum the court concludes that the level of interference with the applicant freedom of expression wa relatively low and proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued lastly concerning the thoroughness of assessing the conflicting interest by the domestic court the court observes that they in essence referred to the previous judgment of the federal court see paragraph above and assessed whether the present case required deviating from the existing caselaw in case where the balancing exercise between the right to freedom of expression and personality right had already been thoroughly undertaken in a comparable case the court see no problem with referring to the respective judgment and to merely consider the factual and legal difference of the case the court therefore considers that the domestic court thoroughly assessed the conflicting interest there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the complaint concerning article admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rule of court claudia westerdiek yonko grozev registrar president,,,
7,in and life in zagreb he wa represented by mr v drenški lasan a lawyer practising in zagreb the government were represented by their agent mr š stažnik the fact of the case a submitted by the party may be summarised a follows on june the applicant a retired politician who had previously held high political function in the country lodged a request with the croatian state archive hrvatski državni arhiv hereinafter the state archive to be granted access to fiftysix document that formed part of the archival collection of the office of the president of the republic of croatia for the period between and the applicant stated that he needed those record in order to write a documentary history of the founding of the croatian state given that the document in question were classified a state secret strictly confidential for a period of thirty year the state archive requested the office of the president of the republic of croatia a the owner of those document to decide on whether or not they should be declassified prior to taking a decision the office of the president requested the opinion of the office of the national security council ured vijeća za nacionalnu sigurnost hereinafter the national security council the national security council examined the applicant request and the content of the requested record and concluded that owing to the nature of the content of certain record the need to safeguard the value for which those document had been declared secret in the first place namely the independence integrity and national security of the republic of croatia and it foreign relation still prevailed the disclosure of the said document would in the opinion of the office of the national security council cause harm to the value protected under section of the data secrecy act see paragraph below subsequently on august the office of the president declassified thirtyone of the requested document but declined to declassify the remaining twentyfive document the document that remained secret were transcript from certain session held in and by the defence and national security council of which the applicant had been a member an advisory body to the president of the republic which at the material time had examined strategic issue of state policy and national security and had coordinated the activity of the highest state body and institution certain record of meeting between the then president of croatia and senior foreign official and croatian official were also left classified by the office of the president in the reasoning for it decision not to declassify the latter document the office of the president held a follows having taken into account the request submitted by the applicant a well a the content of specific record the office of the national security council wa of the opinion that owing to the content of certain record transcript the need to protect the value in defence of which those record had originally been classified independence the integrity and security of the republic of croatia and the foreign relation of the republic of croatia still prevailed therefore those individual record transcript should not be declassified accordingly the office of the national security council deemed that the document listed in this decision contained information the disclosure of which might potentially jeopardise the value listed in section of the data secrecy act in view of the above and given that under section of the data secrecy act the opinion of the office of the national security council is not binding but the owner of the information ha the exclusive authority to ultimately decide whether the classification of certain data is to remain or be changed or if that data is to be declassified it ha been established that declassifying some of the requested document might cause irreparable harm to the value listed in section of the data secrecy act and that the protection of those value prevails over the interest of the public which is why the degree of classification of the document listed in this decision is maintained following the decision of the office of the president on september the state archive refused the applicant request for the declassification of the abovementioned twentyfive record which remained top secret and granted his request to be allowed early access to archival material from that collection with respect to the thirtyone record that had been declassified by the president decision on september the applicant lodged an appeal with the information commissioner alleging inter alia that the contested ruling had been arbitrary unfair and devoid of any clear criterion because he had been granted access to transcript of certain meeting but not to other conversation between the same person on july the information commissioner dismissed the applicant appeal for the purpose of the appeal proceeding she directly inspected the document in question and ultimately accepted the conclusion that their declassification may harm national security and foreign relation noting in addition that the applicant had failed to provide argument in his appeal a to why those document should have been declassified or why his interest in accessing the information outweighed the public interest in protecting the aim at stake the information commissioner also stated that under the relevant domestic law and practice only the owner of the document in issue in this case the office of the president of the republic had the power to alter the classification level of confidential information and that the procedure followed by that body had been lawful on september the applicant brought an action for judicial review in the high administrative court of the republic of croatia visoki upravni sud republike hrvatske seeking to have quashed the information commissioner ruling which in his view did not contain any reasoning in respect of why certain record had been declassified while others had not in her reply the information commissioner stressed that only the owner of the document in question had the power to declassify them on october the high administrative court dismissed the applicant action it found that the applicant had not contested the fact but only the application of the law that the information commissioner had acted lawfully when she had dismissed his appeal and that she had provided clear and valid reasoning for her decision it held that in the case at hand the owner of the information and the body with the power to classify but also to declassify it is the president of the republic when there is a public interest in the disclosure of such information it owner is under an obligation to ass the proportionality between the right of access to information and the protection of the value listed in section and of the data secrecy act and to decide whether to maintain the degree of classification amend it or declassify the information at issue however before reaching it decision the owner of the information must request the opinion of the office of the national security council in line with section of the data secrecy act it can be seen from the case file that following the applicant request the prescribed procedure wa followed given that the firstinstance public authority requested the declassification of the document in question by the owner of the information which after obtaining the opinion of the office of the national security council decided not to declassify them that being so the state archive wa not authorised to provide the requested information on appeal the information commissioner inspected the opinion of the office of the national security council which stated that owing to the content of certain document transcript the need to protect the value in defence of which those record had originally been classified the independence integrity and security of the republic of croatia and it foreign relation still prevailed and gave the opinion that declassifying certain document could cause damage to the value listed in section of the data secrecy act given that under section of the data secrecy act the owner of classified information ha the exclusive power to decide whether to maintain alter the level of the classification or declassify the information in question in the opinion of this court the state archive respected the prescribed procedure and in accordance with the opinion of the office of the national security council and the decision of the owner of the information lawfully rejected the request of the applicant for access to the information in question and the information commissioner on appeal correctly established that in the present case the protection of the value listed in section of the data secrecy act prevailed over the public interest in the publishing of the protected information and that the decision of the owner of the information had been rendered following a lawful procedure therefore in view of the cited legal provision on which the information commissioner decision is based a well a the fact established in the proceeding this court find that the information commissioner correctly dismissed the applicant appeal against the state archive decision and that it provided clear and valid reason for that decision which is entirely upheld by this court the objection of the applicant that the refusal of his request wa not sufficiently reasoned is therefore illfounded and his objection relating to voluntarism voluntarizam in disclosing the requested information is not proven and in light of the lawful procedure in the present case and the discretionary power of the owner of the information a regard declassification of classified information ha no bearing on a different outcome of the present case on december the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court ustavni sud republike hrvatske complaining inter alia of a breach of his right to a fair trial and of his right of access to information on march the constitutional court sitting a a bench of twelve judge dismissed the applicant constitutional complaint having concluded that there had been an interference with the applicant right of access to information because his academic work had been a matter of public interest and that the interference had been lawful the constitutional court held a follows a regard the legitimate aim the constitutional court point out that the impugned judgment in addition to relying on section of the data secrecy act and section of the access to information act stated that the opinion of the office of the national security council had been obtained the constitutional court considers that a more detailed specification of the legitimate reason for the denial of access to the information sought in the specific circumstance of the present case namely upholding the interest of the state in the area of independence integrity national security and the international relation of the republic of croatia would constitute a problem amounting to the disclosure of that protected information to the extent that the legitimate reason for denying access to the information sought have been specified in the present case see subsection of section above the constitutional court considers that the said interference wa necessary in a free and democratic society and proportionate to the nature of the need the constitutional court ha already explained it previously stated opinion mutatis mutandis in it decision no uiii three judge of the constitutional court dissented in the dissenting opinion of two of them judge lk and g stated a follows firstly the applicant right to effective legal protection ha been limited in the course of the administrative proceeding by the president of the republic of croatia a the firstinstance administrative authority a well a by the information commissioner and the administrative court in the case at hand the violation of the constitutional right to effective legal protection is twofold on the one hand the violation occurred because the refusal to grant access to the document in question by the president wa not sufficiently reasoned on the other hand the applicant right wa violated because the information commissioner and the administrative court failed to fulfil their supervisory function and refused to examine the substantive content justification for the assessment of the need to deny access a precisely defined goal the manner in which the protected aim wa jeopardised the scope of any possible damage the risk of such damage occurring but instead limited their assessment to a mere review of the formal reason given the citing of legal provision a review of the relevant deadline and on the inclusion of advisory body secondly we consider that there ha been a violation of the applicant constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression the applicant sought access to a certain number of presidential record with a view to conducting research and analysis for a book covering political event that occurred during the period of croatian history that the record in question concern the denial of access to those record can not be contested if there indeed is a reason on the basis of which it could be concluded that their publication would cause irreparable harm to the national security integrity and independence of the republic of croatia however the applicant and the public do not know whether their publication would indeed have such an effect because they have been prevented from knowing whether an assessment ha been conducted at all and if so whether it wa sufficiently serious and rigorous the applicant is supposed to trust the state authority without having had a chance to question their assessment or to provide counterargument this ha effectively defied the point of the constitutional right to freedom of expression a one of the constitutional form of protection from arbitrary abuse of the power afforded to the authority without being given any real opportunity to question the substance of the assessment of the existence of any risk of irreparable harm to the interest of the republic of croatia the applicant ha been denied his right to effective legal protection of his constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression therefore in the present case the violation of the constitutional guarantee of effective legal protection in administrative proceeding at the same time constitutes a breach of the constitutional freedom of expression in it procedural aspect the president of the republic certainly ha the authority to deny access to presidential record however that authority is not absolute it is subject to an assessment of the risk of irreparable harm being done to the national interest of the republic of croatia the president adopted the decision in the present case in the form of an administrative decision which therefore ha to be reasoned the sufficiency of that reasoning is to be assessed in each individual case on the basis of the specific circumstance of the case the president is not obliged to state the reason which may jeopardise the aim of classifying the document in question but merely stating that the president ha the authority to deny access in order to protect secrecy she requested the opinion of the council she received the opinion whereby the national security council express it view that it is necessary to maintain the existing secrecy classification and she agreed with that opinion with the aim of protecting the interest of the national security integrity and independence of the republic of croatia and it international reputation doe not satisfy the requirement of sufficiency first of all such reasoning doe not indicate that a proportionality test wa indeed conducted citizen are requested to simply assume that the president of the republic conducted a proportionality test a required by the data secrecy act although on the basis of such reasoning it is possible to doubt whether the decision ha been adopted a a result of somebody subjective impression that the requested document should not become public just to be on the safe side we do not question that in case such a the present one it is quite possible for the authority from which access to classified information is being requested will not have at it disposal many fact which it might otherwise be able to refer to in it reasoning a evidence that it decision to refuse a request for declassification is justified without jeopardising the purpose of the classification by the publication thereof however such reasoning can not boil down to stating general aim which the denial of access is supposed to protect such a the independence integrity or safety of the republic of croatia or of it international relation reasoning that doe not indicate more specifically the reason for arguing that the publication of the requested information might jeopardise what are in essence the highest interest of the republic of croatia doe not support the assumption that a proportionality test ha actually been conducted a proportionality test requires the public authority to examine the adequacy of the impugned measure and it necessity it is not possible to achieve either of those if the goal of the measure in question is set hypothetically and in the abstract this is particularly applicable under the circumstance of the present case indeed despite exerting one best attempt it is not easy to understand the reason that would justify the assumption that the publication of conversation that took place almost a quarter of a century ago between two statesman who died many year ago about a historical period and event concerning which in the interim much ha been discovered could jeopardise the integrity of the republic of croatia today moreover were these hypothetical and abstract reason to constitute sufficient reason to deny access to record concerning event of such a nature then they would be sufficient to justify any act of public authority that limit the fundamental right and freedom of citizen the applicant attorney received the constitutional court decision on april on february in an interview given to a daily newspaper the applicant stated that he had finished writing his book and that it would be published in a few month he also stated that should the strasbourg court find a violation of his right and

on access to official document of february read a follows ix review procedure an applicant whose request for an official document ha been refused whether in part or in full or dismissed or ha not been dealt with within the time limit mentioned in principle vi should have access to a review procedure before a court of law or another independent and impartial body established by law an applicant should always have access to an expeditious and inexpensive review procedure involving either reconsideration by a public authority or review in accordance with paragraph above the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the refusal to declassify the document that he had tried to access had amounted to a breach of his right to receive information and that the domestic court had failed to properly scrutinise the refusal in the light of the convention criterion provided in article of the convention which read everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility compatibility ratione materiaea the party argumentsi the government the government maintained that article of the convention did not guarantee the right of individual to seek information owned or restricted by the state nor did it impose an obligation on the state to make such information available the right of access to classified data had to be interpreted narrowly due to the very nature of such information and to the right of each state to make sovereign decision regarding restriction on availability of information of national interest the issue of access to official document wa regulated by the council of europe convention on access to official document of june and not by the european convention on human right in the government view if the right of access to classified information owned by the state were to be one of the right guaranteed under article of the convention the court would be assessing the justification of such classification and of the denial of access to information and the proportionality of these right which wa not it task nor could the state be deprived of that right by a broad interpretation being taken of the convention moreover in the circumstance of the present case the court would need to apply article of the convention beyond what wa prescribed by domestic law a well a what wa decided by domestic court which wa not it task either the government furthermore claimed that there had been no justified purpose for the applicant to access the classified document because accessing their content had not been necessary for him to exercise his freedom to receive or impart information in particular he had never explained why those specific document had been necessary for the writing of his book and nor had he shown their potential importance and connection to it topic moreover in his recent newspaper interview he had clearly shown that the record had been entirely unnecessary for his book since he had managed to finish and wa about to publish the book in question even without having gained access to the document nor did the document pertain to matter of important public concern or affect the wellbeing of citizen or the life of the community at the same time they were not matter capable of giving rise to considerable controversy concerning an important social issue or involving a problem about which the public would have an interest in being informed more than twentyfive year had passed since the end of the war in the former yugoslavia numerous book and article had previously been written on the topic and it wa no longer relevant or at the centre of public attention the government furthermore pointed out that the applicant wa a retired politician who had requested access to the classified document to conduct research on his own initiative and in his own interest unlike the medium and ngo his task had not been to report on matter of public interest nor could it be considered that access to the document sought had been crucial to fulfilling that purpose lastly the document sought by the applicant had not been ready and available a they had been placed at the highest classification level in the stateii the applicant the applicant maintained that article of the constitution guaranteed the right of access to information held by the public authority although this wa not an absolute right the state could not arbitrarily refuse access to such document in the present case the applicant right had not been breached owing to the fact that he had ultimately not been granted access to classified document but by virtue of the fact that the impugned decision of the president of croatia did not demonstrate that an adequate proportionality analysis had been carried out in his case it clearly transpired from the circumstance of his case that he had requested access to the classified record for the purpose of writing a scientific publication on the creation of the croatian state and that he had consequently sought to exercise his right to freedom of expression the applicant furthermore stressed that under domestic law he had not been required to state the reason for requiring access to the requested information lastly the applicant submitted that the information sought had constituted a matter of public interest he maintained that the process of the creation of the croatian state and the war had been and still wa a topic of strong public interest and wa incessantly being used in political campaign although he wa not a journalist or a member of an ngo the applicant considered that a a retired politician involved in scientific research on the issue of the great battle for the freedom of croatia he had proved that his work had not been motivated by personal gain also the information at issue had been ready and availableb the court assessment the court note that the question of whether the situation of which the applicant complained fall within the scope of article is to a large extent linked to the merit of his complaint at the same time the court ha held that the question of the applicability of a convention provision is an issue falling under the court jurisdiction ratione materiae and that the relevant analysis should be carried out at the admissibility stage unless there is a particular reason to join this question to the merit see denisov v ukraine gc no september it ha also adopted this approach in case involving complaint under article concerning the refusal of information request see studio monitori and others v georgia no and january and centre for democracy and the rule of law v ukraine no march given that there are no particular reason to join this question to the merit in the present case the court shall examine the issue of the applicability of article to the present case before going into the merit of the complaint the court reiterates that article doe not confer on the individual a right of access to information held by a public authority or oblige the government to impart such information to the individual however such a right or obligation may arise where access to the information is instrumental for the individual exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression in particular the freedom to receive and impart information and where it denial constitutes an interference with that right see magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no november in determining this question the court will be guided by the principle laid down in magyar helsinki bizottság cited above and will ass the case in the light of it particular circumstance and having regard to the following criterion a the purpose of the information request b the nature of the information sought c the role of the applicant and d whether the information wa ready and available the court firstly note that the applicant sought access to the classified document in order to use the information obtained for the purpose of writing a book about the creation of the croatian state under domestic law he wa not under the obligation to state the reason for which he wa requesting access to the document in question see section of the act on the right of access to information cited at paragraph above in the court view it is not strictly relevant whether the document were indeed crucial for his book what is sufficient is that the applicant sought access to them in order to provide his reader with a full and detailed chronology of the event that took place during the period referred to turning to the nature of the information sought the court reiterates that information to which access is sought must meet a publicinterest test which according to it general definition exists where disclosure provides transparency on the manner of the conduct of public affair and on matter of interest for society a a whole and thereby allows participation in public governance by the general public what might constitute a subject of public interest will moreover depend on the circumstance of each case see for instance ibid in the present case the court note that the constitutional court concluded that a scientific monograph about the creation of the republic of croatia wa a matter of public interest see paragraph above it see no reason to hold otherwise furthermore the court ha accorded a high level of protection to academic researcher see başkaya and okçuoğlu v turkey gc no and echr iv kenedi v hungary no may and gillberg v sweden gc no april and author of literature on matter of public concern see chauvy and others v france no echr vi karsai v hungary no december and lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc no and echr iv lastly despite the fact that any declassification of the document may have been a laborious process involving several different authority there is nothing to show that the requested record had not been ready or available compare and contrast saure v germany dec no october in sum the court is satisfied that the applicant a a former politician intending to publish a historical monograph exercised the right to impart information on a matter of public interest and sought access to information to that end under article of the convention no significant disadvantage article b of the convention a amended by article of protocol no to the convention provides the court shall declare inadmissible any individual application submitted under article if it considers thatb the applicant ha not suffered a significant disadvantage unless respect for human right a defined in the convention and the protocol thereto requires an examination of the application on the merit the government submitted that the applicant had not suffered any significant disadvantage in particular he had been granted access to thirtyone out of fiftysix classified record moreover he had meanwhile finished his book and had stated in an interview that the book would soon be published see paragraph above which meant that the refusal of access to the remaining document had not prevented him from carrying out his scientific work lastly the applicant case did not concern an important matter of principle and had already been thoroughly examined by the domestic authority including the constitutional court the applicant maintained that the damage that he had suffered could not be considered insignificant he had not had at his disposal all the information that he had required in order to be able to write his book this had caused him significant delay and had meant that he had had to conduct further research which had proved futile because he had been unable to find a substitute for the twentyfive document to which had had been denied access it wa true that he had already published his book owing to the importance of the topic and the interest of the public however a he had already stated in the interview see paragraph above submitted by the government a second updated edition of his book would be published if he were ever to gain access to the abovementioned classified record finally the judicial review of his case had been limited solely to procedure and not the substance of the decision on the denial of access inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor the criterion of no significant disadvantage hinge on the idea that a violation of a right however real from a purely legal point of view should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court the assessment of this minimum level is in the nature of thing relative and depends on all the circumstance of the case the severity of a violation should be assessed taking account of both the applicant subjective perception and what is objectively at stake in a particular case see korolev v russia dec no echr however even should the court find that the applicant ha suffered no significant disadvantage it may not declare an application inadmissible if respect for human right a defined in the convention and the protocol thereto requires an examination on the merit or prior to the entry into force of protocol no if the matter ha not been duly considered by a domestic tribunal see juhas đurić v serbia no june following the entry into force of protocol no on august see paragraph above the latter criterion is no longer required and the court may declare an application inadmissible on the ground of nonsignificant disadvantage even if it ha not been duly considered by a domestic tribunal see bartolo v malta dec no september the court ha already held that in case concerning freedom of expression the application of the admissibility criterion contained in article b of the convention should take due account of the importance of this freedom see gachechiladze v georgia no july and be subject to careful scrutiny by the court turning to the present case the court doe not consider the fact that the applicant ultimately published his book decisive for an assessment of whether he had suffered significant disadvantage a he explained the denial of access to the classified document had caused him further research and delay in publishing his book moreover he considered his published work to be incomplete and wa resolved to update it if he were ever to be granted access to the classified document see paragraph and above in any event in the court view the domestic authority application of the data secrecy act concern important question of principle regarding access to document classified under domestic law and go beyond the scope of the applicant case the court therefore concludes that given what wa at stake for the applicant a well a considering the important question of principle arising in his case it is not appropriate to dismiss the present application on the basis of article b of the convention consequently the government objection in this respect must be dismissed conclusion the court note that this complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merit the party observation the applicant did not question the lawfulness of the interference with his right to freedom of expression however he could not discern which legitimate aim justifying the impugned interference had been pursued by the authority refusal to declassify the specific restricted document the applicant maintained that the domestic authority had failed to perform a proportionality analysis in his case not having been granted access to the document in question he could not have substantiated further why his interest in publishing his book would override the national security interest of maintaining classified data he further stressed that the information commissioner and the high administrative court had limited their respective subsequent review to verifying the lawfulness of the procedure without assessing the substance of the argument that it wa necessary to deny access to the document which he had requested in other word the domestic authority simply assumed that the office of the president of the republic had performed a proper proportionality test the applicant wa aware that the nature of the classified information did not allow the domestic authority to give all the reason that had led them to deny him access to the classified document however in his opinion that denial could not be justified hypothetically and by using abstract reasoning when limiting an individual right the state had to show convincingly that it had examined in detail all requested information and had weighed the conflicting interest this could only be demonstrated if the subsequent decision clearly stated which specific aim had been pursued by restricting access to each of the document at issue the authority should also explain why it wa necessary to restrict access to the entire document and not only to part thereof lastly the applicant submitted that one of the document that had not been declassified by the president had already been made public in another book published in he deemed it odd that the state did not know that it classified document had been leaked or had not investigated the issue further the government maintained that the interference with the applicant freedom of expression had had a basis in domestic law namely section of the archival material and archival institution act read together with section of the data secrecy act they furthermore argued that the interference had also pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the independence integrity and security of the country the government also stressed that all the domestic authority had weighed the conflicting interest of the applicant in being allowed to access the requested information against the interest of the state in maintaining the highest classification level for certain document a in the case of bédat v switzerland gc no march the respondent state could not ex post facto provide proof that the disclosure of confidential information would have caused actual and tangible harm to the stated value protected by the classification of such information such a requirement would deprive the classification of such information of any meaning a regard the applicant statement that the classified document had already been made public in another book in the government stressed that the office of the president had never declassified those record the government thus wondered how the applicant could have concluded that the document that had been made public in were the same a those to which the applicant had sought access if the applicant had information that the publication in of the abovementioned record had been the result of unlawful conduct he wa obliged to report it to the prosecution authority the court assessment in view of it finding above see paragraph above the court considers that by denying the applicant access to the requested document the domestic authority interfered with his right protected by article of the convention such an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression must be prescribed by law pursue one or more legitimate aim in the light of paragraph of article and be necessary in a democratic society the party agreed that the interference in the present case had been in accordance with the law namely section of the archival material and archival institution act the court can also agree that it pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the independence integrity and security of the country and it foreign relation although the applicant pointed out that it had been unclear which aim had been protected by refusing to declassify each of the restricted document see paragraph above the general principle concerning the question whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the court caselaw and have been summarised a follows see among many other authority animal defender international v the united kingdom gc no echr and delfi a v estonia gc no echr i freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society a set forth in article this freedom is subject to exception which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article iii the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact unlike a number of previous case examined by the court which involved access to personal information relating to the applicant or other person and the balancing of the right to freedom of expression against the right of others compare magyar helsinki bizottság cited above centre for democracy and the rule of law cited above the present case concern classified information relating to a sensitive part of croatia rather recent history which a the applicant maintained himself still formed part of considerable public debate see paragraph above national security being an evolving and contextdependent concept the state must be afforded a wide margin of appreciation in assessing what pose a national security risk in their country at a particular time see mutatis mutandis liu v russia no no july and leander v sweden march series a no at the same time the court point out that the concept of national security and public safety should be applied with restraint interpreted restrictively and brought into play only where it ha been shown to be necessary to suppress the release of the information for the purpose of protecting national security and public safety see stoll v switzerland gc no echr v the court ha recognised that it wa not wellequipped to challenge the national authority judgment concerning the existence of national security consideration see in the context of article of the convention janowiec and others v russia gc no and echr however even when national security is at stake the concept of lawfulness and the rule of law in a democratic society require that measure affecting fundamental human right must be subject to some form of adversarial proceeding before an independent body competent to review the reason for the decision ibid see also yam v the united kingdom no january if there wa no possibility of challenging effectively the executive assertion that national security wa at stake the state authority would be able to encroach arbitrarily on right protected by the convention see liu v russia no december and al nashif v bulgaria no june the court ha further stressed that the fairness of proceeding and the procedural guarantee afforded to the applicant are factor to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see baka v hungary gc no june in case such a the present one involving national security concern resulting in decision restricting human right the court will therefore scrutinise the national decisionmaking procedure to ensure that it incorporated adequate safeguard to protect the interest of the person concerned see yam cited above see also mutatis mutandis janowiec and others cited above fitt v the united kingdom gc no echr ii regner v the czech republic gc no september and the relevant council of europe material cited at paragraph and above turning to the present case the court note that the applicant complained that none of the domestic authority reviewing his case had conducted a detailed proportionality analysis weighing his interest against the public interest sought to be protected or at least that they had not demonstrated that such an analysis had been conducted the applicant further criticised the limited nature of the judicial review in his case the court ha previously criticised the national authority for their failure to conduct a thorough proportionality analysis in refusing to allow an individual access to classified document see yuriy chumak v ukraine no march however unlike in that case the applicant did not claim that the withholding the classified information in the present case had lacked any legal basis nor ha there been any disagreement between the authority a to the reason for refusing his request in the present case the applicant requested access to fiftysix document from the state archive which had been assigned the highest level of classification under domestic law for a period of thirty year having consulted the document in issue the office of the national security council advised the president of the republic to declassify thirtyone of them while it deemed that the declassification of the twentyfive remaining document may harm the independence integrity national security and foreign relation of the country the document requested by the applicant had thus been carefully reviewed by the owner of the information assisted by a specialised advisory body and for the most part the applicant request to access the document in question had been granted the court further observes that on appeal the information commissioner a an independent body in charge of protecting monitoring and promoting the right of access to information also had the benefit of direct access to the classified document see paragraph above and thus wa able to review the substantive criterion contained in the executive order while it is true that only the owner of the document in issue that is to say the office of the president had the power to alter the classification level the court note that the information commissioner at no point disagreed with the opinion of the office of the national security council or sought to argue otherwise to the contrary she agreed with the president conclusion that the declassification of the document in issue may harm national security and foreign relation of the country see paragraph above and found no abuse of discretion by the executive in addition she also noted that the applicant had failed to explain in his appeal why his interest in accessing that information would outweigh such crucial public interest ibid in the court view nothing in the case file suggests that the competent authority in the present case failed to perform a proportionality analysis it being a requirement under the domestic law see paragraph above moreover the applicant request for information had been carefully assessed by five different national authority the requested document were directly inspected by at least two of them the information commissioner having been able to review the substantive criterion of the decision to deny access see paragraph above according to section of the act on the right of access to information the high administrative court could have also been granted access to the document in question see paragraph above the court further note that the president decision refusing to declassify some of the requested document wa based on an opinion of a specialised body for dealing with national security issue and wa ultimately reviewed and upheld by the information commissioner the high administrative court and the constitutional court in such circumstance the court doe not find that the manner in which the domestic authority assessed the applicant request had been fundamentally flawed or devoid of appropriate procedural safeguard that being said the court is cognisant that in the context of national security a sphere which traditionally form part of the inner core of state sovereignty the competent authority may not be expected to give the same amount of detail in their reasoning a for instance in ordinary civil or administrative case providing detailed reason for refusing declassification of topsecret document may easily run counter to the very purpose for which that information had been classified in the first place see mutatis mutandis regner cited above taking into consideration the extent of procedural safeguard provided to the applicant in the present case see paragraph above the court is satisfied that the reason adduced by the national authority for refusing him access to the document in question had not only been relevant but also in the circumstance sufficient in view of the foregoing the court considers that the interference with the applicant freedom of access to information had been necessary and proportionate to the important aim of national security relied on and that the subsequent independent domestic review of his request in the circumstance had not been outside the state wide margin appreciation in this area there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention ii other alleged violation of the convention the applicant complained that he had not had a fair hearing a provided in article of the convention however having regard to the fact of the case the submission of the party and it above finding under article of the convention the court considers that it ha examined the main legal question raised in the present application and that there is no need to give a separate ruling on the admissibility and merit of the remaining complaint see centre for legal resource on behalf of valentin câmpeanu v romania gc no echr with further reference for these reason the court unanimouslydeclares the application admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention hold that it is not necessary to examine the complaint under article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on february pursuant to rule and of the rule of court renata degener péter paczolay registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the separate opinion of judge ktistakis is annexed to this judgment ppcrd concurring opinion of judge ktistakisi voted in favour of no violation of article of the convention in this case but on the basis of reasoning that differs from that of the majority of the court in particular firstly the applicant did not explain to the national authority or to the court why while he had succeeded in declassifying thirtyone of the requested document the twentyfive document which had remained secret were so important for the documentary history he wa preparing see paragraph all the more so since he ha announced the publication of his book in the near future without these secret document see paragraph the reason for the significance of the secret document could in fact be easily identified by the applicant because they were transcript from session held in and by the defence and national security council of which the applicant had been a member see paragraph furthermore and secondly the applicant did not ask the high administrative court a permitted by national legislation see paragraph to inspect such information in order to ass whether there were substantial reason justifying the refusal to declassify the secret document because they might harm national security and foreign relation in more general term i consider that in the light of article of the convention the court should not be prevented from assessing in addition to procedural safeguard the substantive reason for a state refusal to declassify document in so far a national legislation provides for this albeit to a limited extent a is the case with section of the croatian act on the right of access to information see article of protocol no and paragraph of the explanatory report to protocol no,,,
8,the applicant wa born in and life in sant angelo in campo lucca a the applicant circular letter in the applicant wa practising law in september he sent a letter to the italian national legal service commission consiglio superiore della magistratura the csm in which he complained about the conduct of a judge x at the lucca district court he subsequently transmitted the content of that letter by mean of a circular letter to a number of judge of the same court but without expressly referring to x by name the relevant part of that circular letter read a follows before you receive any incorrect or untrue information before the corporatist spirit prevails over a correct interpretation of the reason that drove me to write to the csm to the ministry of justice to the national council of notary and to the national bar council about the conduct of two judge of the lucca district court in the context of a judicial partition procedure to which my client were party and before any of my colleague come to apologise on my behalf for my initiative perhaps making out that i am insane or irresponsible my intention is to clarify and tell you the reason which led me to do so an appeal on point of law is pending against a judgment of the lucca district court in which that court ruling against the claim by a female partner and deciding on the related issue of the partition of an inheritance asked the investigating judge to proceed with the sale of a flat which wa the sole item of property to be divided between the heir and which wa occupied by the partner and her daughter an heir born to the cohabiting couple since the judgment of the lucca district court wa not final it wa not possible to proceed with the sale or to initiate the procedure relating thereto since this wa prohibited expressly by article of the code of civil procedure the other heir however applied for the sale and the investigating judge in spite of our repeated request for suspension of the sale which were all rejected brought about after two auction without a buyer the conveyance of the property to a third party at the third auction here are the specific reason for which all our request were rejected in spite of this i would like to point out at the outset that i do not feel any animosity towards the judiciary and judge in general and that i consider by contrast that the role played by judge is crucial and irreplaceable for civil society there are and have been judge who carry out and have carried out their duty with great dignity and decorum decoro and who deserve my admiration and the admiration of all those who have worked in the field of justice none of u can forget y who died one can say on the battlefield i still remember that in the courtroom he wa the one out of all his colleague who even in his state of extreme and obvious suffering took the greatest number case for adjudication and he carried on doing this until the bitter end i confess that if i had been able to spare him the effort in view of his condition i would willingly have taken over his workload but there are other equally deserving judge who work even during their holiday going to the office talking to lawyer and with whom we can have a form of collaboration and dialogue and to them i also express my esteem and admiration i am well aware that justice is done by men and precisely for that reason decision may be erroneous and incomplete i still prefer however a human justice to one that is automated but what i refuse to accept is the idea that when the right of the individual and the dignity of those whose task it is to defend him or her are at stake those right could be decided upon in a partial manner perhaps with a display of arrogance or that a ruling could be given with total indifference and lack of commitment i personally believe strongly in the autonomy of the judiciary and i feel that without respect for the autonomy of the person whose task it is to decide it would be impossible to have dispassionate and fair judgment autonomy however can not be turned into an absolute discretionary power because that would be bordering on or tantamount to arbitrariness i have pointed out how i see the meaning of justice and reiterate that i think very highly of the duty exercised by judge and that my full admiration go to those who act with dedication commitment and decorum decoro i am even envious of judge because they probably have more time to study and to dwell on issue and also to attend to other cultural and social interest than lawyer who by the nature and specificity of their work do not always manage to do thing or to do thing well i often take home thing to read and to study and i end up midevening nodding off over a book after a busy day running from one office to another in the morning and answering the phone or receiving client in the afternoon i also understand that the judiciary is burdened with work and with problem that the staffing is insufficient and the workload huge and for that reason it is true that protest esposti do not help to get the work done more easily and that more collaboration and dialogue would be better than protest there are limit however that in my view should not be passed and after thinking about this for quite some time i decided to submit this particular protest the letter to the csm i will now quote the last part of my protest in which i dwell on the meaning of the lawyer profession and ask whether it is legitimate that any decision or conduct should always be accepted this lawyer would point out a follows it is regrettable to direct this letter against individual who even if they have different duty are considered by this lawyer to be colleague a practitioner in law usually call each other he considers however that he is obliged to do so in response to a lack of commitment and total indifference towards the legitimate demand of the citizen in whose name justice is done with a belief in impunity a the position is one of power even though it should be seen a the discharge of a duty and last but not least a lack of respect for the dignity and responsibility of this lawyer profession this lawyer ha practised law in court at three level of jurisdiction ha borne very high cost on behalf of his client to the point where if one were to apply the professional rate one would exceed the amount of the claim ha sought in three statement of claim filed in the florence court of appeal a stay of execution under article of the code of civil procedure but his request were all rejected by reasoning that leaf much to be desired but that is not the subject of this protest ha accumulated a formidable pile of document of all description and ha seen the attachment of fund in respect of his own claim go up in smoke in the time it ha taken to work on these case he could probably have dealt with fifteen ordinary case of average complexity if work any type of work provided it is lawful ha it own protection and it own dignity then the judge too more than any person a a result of his function and role can not but allow himself not to respect for the work of others including that of the lawyer a a legal practitioner this lawyer ha a duty to provide some certainty to his client who is the citizen in whose name justice is done judgment are headed in the name of the italian people what certainty can the lawyer provide if each judge instead of applying the law give his preferred interpretation and doe not even explain his interpretation of the law in question it should be noted that the system of appeal and claim is no guarantee for the citizen judge are only human and can make mistake errare humanum est but they can not and must not wilfully make mistake by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence and the citizen must have his or her claim upheld provided they are well founded from the earliest stage there are a large number of case this can be explained by the fact that if many decision had been taken correctly from the outset one could have avoided the proliferation of case procedure and claim a can be seen here and not forgetting the many case where the citizen disappointed and bemused to receive abnormal decision having lost all confidence in the justice system decides not to appeal this entail a justified loss of confidence in the court and an increase in workload and expense for the state because of the extra work for other judge registry and bailiff and what justification and explanation could be given by the lawyer to this client to whom he had predicted a certain result with all due caution only to present a decision by the judge that is diametrically opposed to that which he predicted if that is the result of an error or a lack of knowledge or commitment or analysis on the part of the lawyer he should take responsibility for it but when this depends on the judge it is damaging to the lawyer because the client will necessarily have a negative opinion of the lawyer work are client and citizen capable of understanding whether it is the lawyer or the judge who ha made a mistake and to what extent if the lawyer doe not obtain appropriate result with legal argument what other mean are available what must the lawyer do to obtain something to which he is professionally entitled or should the lawyer not make life difficult for himself and carry on regardless tending to his garden il suo orticello while protecting his head from any tile that might fall off the roof because on the one hand he is not protected and on the other he is at the mercy of another person discretionary power without any regard for his own professional dignity when this letter reach you i will be undergoing a medical operation i am sorry that for the time being i can not provide any further clarification or explanation to those who may wish them i am however ready if necessary to answer for my conduct and to provide any clarification that may be requested of me after my operation when i am in a better state of health again b firstinstance proceeding finding that certain expression used in the circular letter had impugned his reputation x filed a criminal complaint for defamation against the applicant a x wa a judge in lucca the file wa transferred under article of the code of criminal procedure to the judicial authority of genoa on february the genoa public prosecutor requested that the applicant be committed to stand trial before the court of that city x joined the criminal proceeding against the applicant a a civil party according to the charge in the circular letter the applicant had expressed admissible lecite criticism in so far a he spoke about interpreting and performing the work of a judge but had then overstepped the limit to his freedom of expression by writing the following sentence in particulara autonomy can not be turned into an absolute discretionary power because that would be bordering on or tantamount to arbitrarinessb in a partial manner perhaps with a display of arrogance or a ruling given with total indifference and lack of commitmentc the judge can not allow himself not to respect the work of others including that of the lawyerd judge are only human and can make mistake but they can not and must not wilfully make mistake by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence at the hearing of march the representative of the public prosecutor office stated that the applicant also had to be charged with proffering insult given that it transpired from x statement that he had been one of the recipient of the circular letter in a judgment of february deposited in the court registry on february the genoa district court convicted the applicant of defamation and proffering insult and sentenced him to four month imprisonment and to the reimbursement of x court cost amounting to euro eur with reparation for the damage sustained by x the amount of that damage wa to be fixed in separate civil proceeding the court nevertheless awarded x an advance payment provisionale of eur the district court observed that it wa not in dispute that the applicant had written the circular letter and had asked his secretary to send copy to the judge in the civil division of the lucca district court during the proceeding the applicant had filed pleading and had made spontaneous statement his argument in defence had not however made it possible to disregard the offensive nature of the expression used in the circular letter exacerbated by the fact that he wa a lawyer in his letter the applicant had stated that he had the greatest respect for the judiciary and for judge who carried out their duty with dedication commitment and decorum but he wa clearly not talking here about x who had been accused by the applicant of being arrogant and indifferent of believing that he wa immune because he held a position of power and of having committed wilful mistake by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence those accusation could be explained not by x inaction in the handling of a case but by the decision taken by x in a case where the applicant request had been rejected instead of reiterating his legal argument the applicant had overstepped the limit of his right to criticism alleging that x had erred wilfully thus seriously impugning the honour of the judge in question according to the district court the subject of the accusation contained in the circular letter could only have been x a shown by similar letter which expressly referred to that judge addressed by the applicant and his client to the csm the ministry of justice the national council of notary and the national bar council the applicant defence esimente of provocation article of the criminal code wa not accepted even supposing that the decision of x could be regarded a unfair act the circular letter sent about four month after those decision did not constitute an immediate reaction to them c court of appeal proceeding the applicant lodged an appeal he alleged among other thing that the offence he wa said to have committed were punishable merely by a fine that the sentence imposed on him had been disproportionate and that the advance he had to pay wa excessive moreover in his complaint x had not mentioned that he himself had been a recipient of the circular letter thus ruling out the charge of proffering insult the applicant also argued that it could not be seen from the text of the letter that the criticism wa directed at x and that this document when assessed a a whole wa merely a manifestation of his frustration about the shortcoming of the justice system in general lastly in the alternative he took the view that his defence of provocation wa valid he argued that in the proceeding for the partition of an inheritance x had on a number of occasion rejected his request for the suspension of a sale by auction of the flat in question and that x decision had subsequently been overturned by another judge at the hearing of march the applicant stated that it had not been his intention to offend x personally and he produced document a evidence of his illhealth in a judgment of the same day deposited in the court registry on april the genoa court of appeal ruled that no prosecution could be brought on a charge of proffering insult a there had been no criminal complaint on that ground and reduced the sentence for the offence of defamation to a fine of eur it stated that this sentence wa fully remitted condonata and ordered the applicant to make reparation for the damage sustained by x which it assessed at eur and to reimburse x court cost in the appeal proceeding eur the court of appeal observed that in the first part of his circular letter the applicant had recounted the tribulation of the partition proceeding in which x had taken the impugned decision he had added that he regretted having to make complaint about certain individual x and another judge whom even though they had different duty from his own he regarded a colleague in addition the judge of the lucca district court giving testimony in the firstinstance proceeding had had no difficulty in identifying x a the addressee of the criticism in the circular letter in those circumstance the applicant argument that the letter wa merely a manifestation of his discontent about the justice system in general could not be accepted in the court of appeal view the decision taken by x in the context of the inheritance partition proceeding could at most be regarded a erroneous but not a unfair the court also pointed out that one of the question at the heart of the dispute the existence of inheritance right in favour of the partner had been settled by the court of cassation differently from the applicant proposed solution the national bar council had in fact noted that the applicant letter could have been seen a a mean of pressure against the judge concerned according to the court of appeal the applicant had not expressly challenged the part of the firstinstance judgment considering that the expression contained in the circular letter had overstepped the limit of the right to criticise the applicant who had no criminal record had to be allowed the benefit of mitigating circumstance and under article of legislative decree no of see paragraph below the penalty for defamation wa now a mere fine and not a custodial sentence the court of appeal observed that the distribution of a letter such a that sent by the applicant within a small court could not but impugn the dignity of the judge against whom it wa directed and his image a an independent judge the expression used by the applicant outside any procedural act sought to call into question the professional conduct of x who wa portrayed within a restricted community a a partial and soft judge in the light of those consideration the court of appeal ruling on an equitable basis awarded the civil party eur in nonpecuniary damage d appeal on point of law the applicant appealed on point of law he reiterated his grievance and referring to a particular passage in his ground of appeal stated that the court of appeal had made a mistake in asserting that the defendant had failed to challenge the finding about the offensive nature of the expression contained in the circular letter in any event the judge had been required at all stage of the proceeding to verify of his own motion whether or not the criminal charge in question wa made out in a judgment of november deposited in the court registry on december the court of cassation finding that the court of appeal had given logical and correct reasoning in respect of all the contentious point dismissed the applicant appeal on point of law ii relevant domestic law article of the criminal code provides for the offence of defamation the relevant part of that article read a follows anyone who in communication with more than one person offends against the reputation of another shall be punished by one year imprisonment or by a fine of up to eur defamation which consists in imputing a particular fact shall be punished by up to two year imprisonment or by a fine of up to eur defamation which is disseminated by the press or any other form of publicity or in a public document shall be punished by imprisonment of between six month and three year or by a fine of at least eur in the event of defamation against a member of a political administrative or judicial authority or one of it representation the sentence shall be increased legislative decree no of august article a gave jurisdiction to the justice of the peace in matter of defamation among others article a read a follows in respect of offence within the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace the sentence shall be converted a followsa where the offence is punished by a sentence of imprisonment a an alternative to that of a fine a pecuniary sanction of between and lira shall be applied if the custodial sentence is higher than a maximum of six month the applicable sanction shall be the abovementioned fine or home detention of between six and thirty day or a period of community service of between ten day and three month the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant argued that his conviction for defamation had breached article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government challenged that argument a admissibility the court find that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submissionsa the applicant the applicant submitted that he had been convicted on account of a letter in which he had set out his thought on the different way of interpreting and exercising the duty of a judge his assessment had not been interpreted in line with their real meaning and had been connected to a subject x who wa not the actual target according to the applicant there wa no evidence that he intended to impugn the reputation and integrity of x moreover the anomaly in the italian justice system whereby judge were not de facto accountable for their conduct had been underlined by many european decision by book and by website it wa the court system a a whole and not x which had been the target of the applicant criticism the applicant further observed that genoa district court had given him a custodial sentence not prescribed by law and that although he had no criminal record he had not been granted general mitigating circumstance attenuanti generiche the applicant alleged that he had sent his circular letter to a number of judge at lucca district court solely to avoid undermining the reciprocal relationship of friendship and esteem between him and those judge and to protect himself against any distortion of the content of his letter to the csm he also stated that the conduct of x who had refused any attempt to reach a friendly settlement to the dispute had been driven by feeling of animosity towards himb the government the government took the view that the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation or right of others and of the authority and impartiality of the judiciary they argued that it wa also necessary in a democratic society because the expression used by the applicant in his circular letter had been offensive and had sought to denigrate x who had been accused in substance of deliberately and knowingly taking an unfair decision and of being arrogant lacking in commitment and indifferent x had thus been portrayed negatively and a a judge who showed total disregard for the fundamental ethical principle of his profession in the government opinion the applicant attitude could not be justified in the light of the judicial disagreement which lay behind his animosity towards x in addition the court of appeal had acknowledged the existence of mitigating circumstance in the applicant favour and reduced the amount of the sanction imposed on him at first instance in the light of the foregoing the government took the view that in sentencing the applicant the domestic court which were better placed than the international court to ass the fact and the necessity of the interference had not overstepped their margin of appreciation in such matter if there had been a violation of the convention it had been committed by the applicant who had unduly impugned the reputation of x protected a it wa by article the court assessmenta whether there ha been an interference it is not in dispute between the party that the applicant conviction constituted an interference with his right to freedom of expression under article of the convention see mutatis mutandis belpietro v italy no september b whether the interference wa justified prescribed by law and legitimate aim an interference will infringe the convention if it doe not meet the requirement of paragraph of article it should therefore be determined whether it wa prescribed by law whether it pursued one or more of the legitimate aim set out in that paragraph and whether it wa necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve the relevant aim or aim see pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark no echr xi and ricci v italy no october it is not in dispute that the interference wa prescribed by law namely by article of the criminal code see paragraph above and article a of legislative decree no of see paragraph above the applicant conviction pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation and right of another in this case those of x see mutatis mutandis nikula v finland no echr ii perna v italy gc no echr v ormanni v italy no july and belpietro cited above it also had the aim of maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary of which x a judge wa a member see for example and mutatis mutandis kyprianou v cyprus gc no echr xiii foglia v switzerland no december july and sarl libération v france no echr and di giovanni v italy no july it remains to be ascertained whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic societyc necessary in a democratic societyi general principle in order to determine whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society the court must ascertain whether it met a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article see janowski v poland gc no echr i association ekin v france no echr viii and stoll v switzerland gc no echr v the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they have delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation see fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state ha exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole including the remark held against the applicant and the context in which they were written see news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i in particular the court must determine whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify the interference are relevant and sufficient and whether the interference wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued see chauvy and others v france no echr vi in so doing the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority basing their decision on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article see among many other authority zana v turkey november report of judgment and decision vii de diego nafría v spain no march and pedersen and baadsgaard cited above in order to ass the justification for a given statement it is necessary to distinguish between statement of fact and value judgment the existence of fact can be demonstrated whereas the truth of value judgment is not susceptible of proof see oberschlick v austria no july report iv and in such case a requirement to provide proof is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article see morice v france gc no echr the characterisation of remark a statement of fact and value judgment fall primarily within the ambit of the margin of appreciation afforded to national authority in particular the domestic court see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no however even where a statement amount to a value judgment it must have a sufficient factual basis to support it otherwise it may be excessive see jerusalem v austria no echr ii and ormanni cited above in addition the existence of procedural safeguard for the benefit of a defendant in defamation proceeding is among the factor to be taken into account in assessing the proportionality of an interference under article in particular it is important for the defendant to be afforded a realistic chance to prove that there wa a sufficient factual basis for his allegation see inter alia steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii hasan yazıcı v turkey no april and morice cited above a particular aspect of the present case is that at the material time the applicant wa a lawyer and his dispute with x had arisen in the context of his professional activity in it nikula judgment cited above see also steur v the netherlands no echr xi and fuchs v germany dec no and january the court summarised a follows the specific principle applicable to the legal profession the court reiterates that the special status of lawyer give them a central position in the administration of justice a intermediary between the public and the court such a position explains the usual restriction on the conduct of member of the bar moreover the court the guarantor of justice whose role is fundamental in a state based on the rule of law must enjoy public confidence regard being had to the key role of lawyer in this field it is legitimate to expect them to contribute to the proper administration of justice and thus to maintain public confidence therein see schöpfer v switzerland judgment of may report of judgment and decision iii pp with further reference in addition in the case of morice cited above and the court observed that a lawyer are entitled to comment in public on the administration of justice provided that their criticism doe not overstep certain bound in order to protect the judiciary from gratuitous and unfounded attack which may be driven solely by a wish or strategy to ensure that the judicial debate is pursued in the medium or to settle a score with the judge handling a particular case b lawyer can not make remark that are so serious that they overstep the permissible expression of comment without a sound factual basis and c remark by lawyer must be assessed in their general context in particular to ascertain whether they can be regarded a misleading or a a gratuitous personal attack and to ensure that the expression used had a sufficiently close connection with the fact of the case it is also necessary to take into account that the defamed party x wa a serving member of the judiciary according to the court caselaw the limit of acceptable criticism may in some circumstance be wider with regard to judge acting in their official capacity than to ordinary citizen see morice cited above however it can not be said that civil servant knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent to which politician do and should therefore be treated on an equal footing with the latter when it come to criticism of their action civil servant must enjoy public confidence in condition free of undue perturbation if they are to be successful in performing their task it may therefore prove necessary to protect them from offensive and abusive verbal attack in the course of their duty see janowski cited above and nikula cited above it should lastly be reiterated that the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are factor to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference see for example ceylan v turkey gc no echr iv tammer v estonia no echr i and cumpănă and mazăre v romania gc no echr xiii application of those principle to the present case the court note at the outset that the applicant argued both before it see paragraph above and before the domestic court see paragraph above that the criticism in his circular letter were not directed at x but at the italian judicial system a a whole the court can not agree with this argument it observes in this connection that the letter in question see paragraph above contained express reference to the letter that the applicant had sent to the csm to complain about the conduct of x and that passage from that letter had been quoted in extenso in addition the applicant summed up the main aspect of the judicial dispute in the context of which according to him x had taken unfair decision of which the reason were briefly set out the applicant circular letter wa divided into two part the first part contained an account of the decision taken in the partition procedure the second contained consideration on behaviour from which judge should refrain and it consequence in the court view even though the second part of the letter wa drafted in the form of general consideration it can be interpreted only a a criticism of the conduct of the judge x who without being expressly mentioned is the protagonist in the account which constituted the premise of the applicant observation and assessment in those circumstance the court share the finding of the district court and the genoa court of appeal see paragraph and above according to which x wa certainly the subject of the grievance set out in the circular letter it remains to be determined whether the remark in question overstepped the bound of admissible criticism in a democratic society it can be seen from the text of the circular letter see paragraph above that in substance the applicant reproached x on two account a for taking unfair and arbitrary decision and b for being a biased judge and for having wilfully made mistake by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence in the court view the first criticism amount to a value judgment a to the nature and legal basis of the decision taken by x a indicated in paragraph above according to the court caselaw the truth of such opinion is not susceptible of proof moreover they had a certain factual basis in particular the applicant had been the representative of one of the party to judicial proceeding for the partition of an inheritance in the context of those proceeding the applicant had on a number of occasion sought to have the sale of a flat suspended and his request had been dismissed by x on the basis of reasoning which according to the applicant subjective opinion wa erroneous and contrary to the law the court therefore can not consider the first criticism to be excessive see mutatis mutandis morice cited above where the court found that criticism made by the lawyer acting for the civil party about the conduct of the investigating judge during the judicial investigation were value judgment with a sufficient factual basis the same can not be said however when it come to the second criticism namely that x wa a biased judge who had wilfully made mistake by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence this criticism implied that x had disregarded the ethical obligation inherent in the duty of a judge or even that she had committed a criminal offence the adoption by a judge of a deliberately erroneous decision could constitute an abuse of authority in any event the circular letter alleged that x did not have the quality of impartiality independence or objectivity quality which characterise the exercise of judicial activity however the applicant never sought to prove the veracity of the conduct attributed to x and adduced no evidence to show any malicious intent in the decision that he contested in the court view his allegation of misconduct on the part of x were based only on the fact that the judge had dismissed the claim he had submitted in the interest of his client contrast morice cited above it is also noteworthy that the applicant who had referred a complaint against judge x see paragraph above sent out his circular letter without waiting for the outcome of the csm proceeding in defending himself before the domestic court the applicant merely argued that his criticism had not been directed at x in person see mutatis mutandis perna cited above and fuchs decision cited above see also by contrast nikula cited above where the court observed that the applicant criticism had only concerned the manner in which a public prosecutor had discharged his duty in a given court case and not any professional or other quality of the prosecutor in question the court however ha already dismissed that argument see paragraph above the court also take account of the context in which the circular letter wa written and distributed in this connection it would first note that the applicant criticism were not made at the hearing or in the course of the judicial proceeding for the partition of an inheritance in that sense the present case can be distinguished from nikula cited above see in particular paragraph where the court found a violation of article of the convention the court further observes that outside the judicial procedure the applicant sent his circular letter to x in person see paragraph above and to many other judge at the lucca district court see paragraph above a the genoa court of appeal rightly observed see paragraph above the distribution of the letter within a small community such a that of a local court would inevitably harm the reputation and professional image of the judge concerned lastly the court note that while it is true that at first instance the applicant wa given a custodial sentence without the benefit of mitigating circumstance in view of his clean criminal record that sanction wa replaced on appeal by a small fine of eur which moreover wa declared fully discharged see paragraph above in addition that mitigation wa applied by the judge at second instance see paragraph above and the amount of the compensation awarded to x eur can not be regarded a excessive the court would further observe that in case such a the present one which call for a fair balance to be struck between the right to respect for private life and the right to freedom of expression it take the view that the adjudication of the application should not in principle vary depending on whether it ha been lodged under article by the person criticised or under article by the author of the criticism the two right merit in principle equal respect see hachette filipacchi associés ici paris v france no july timciuc v romania dec no october and mosley v the united kingdom no may accordingly the margin of appreciation should in principle be the same in both case if the striking of a balance by the domestic court is consistent with the criterion established by the court caselaw the court would require strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see palomo sánchez and others v spain gc no and echr and mgn limited v the united kingdom no and january in the court view there are no such reason in the present case see mutatis mutandis di giovanni cited above having regard to the foregoing the court find that the applicant conviction for the defamatory remark contained in the circular letter and the sanction imposed on him were not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and that the ground given by the national court were relevant and sufficient for the purpose of justifying those measure the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression wa necessary in a democratic society in order to protect the reputation of others and to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary within the meaning of article it follows that there ha been no violation of article for these reason the court declares unanimously the application admissible hold by five vote to two that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in french and notified in writing on june pursuant to rule and of the rule of court françoise elens passos päivi hirveläregistrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the joint separate opinion of judge wojtyczek and grozev is annexed to this judgment phfep joint dissenting opinion of judge wojtyczek and grozevtranslation we can not agree with the view expressed by the majority that there ha been no violation of article of the convention in the present case the applicant submitted his complaint alleging a violation of his freedom of expression in the context of a conflict between the right of two individual namely between his own freedom of expression and the right of another person to the protection of his reputation moreover the majority have emphasised the fact that the interference with the applicant freedom of expression sought to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary of which x wa a member there is no doubt that the need to protect the reputation of others justifies certain restriction on freedom of expression a person reputation must be protected effectively and any damage caused to it must entail a sanction in situation of conflict between right the national authority must carefully weigh up the right in question and seek solution whereby the right are upheld to the highest degree possible in any event a the majority have observed any interference with a right must always be justified by relevant and serious reason and remain proportionate to the aim pursued in it caselaw the court ha identified a certain number of factor which must be analysed in order to determine whether a restriction on freedom of expression is justified see in particular von hannover v germany no gc no and echr and axel springer ag v germany gc no february among these factor can be mentioned in particular the question whether the remark in question contribute to a public debate the content form and consequence of the remark the conduct of the person affected and the severity of the sanction imposed in the present case the reasoning of the judicial decision delivered in italy appears not to have taken those various factor into account the italian court confined themselves to establishing that the applicant had actually made the offending remark that those remark had been disseminated among the judge of the court in question and that they were directed at a particular judge in that court they further took the view that the remark had overstepped the permissible limit but no analysis of the relevant circumstance a identified in the court caselaw wa carried out the methodology applied by the domestic court doe not meet the requirement of article of the convention a interpreted by the court in particular the reason given by the national court can not be regarded a satisfactory in term of the requirement to give relevant and serious reason in order to justify any interference with the right to freedom of expression in assessing restriction on freedom of expression it is necessary to pay particular attention to the content of the impugned remark and especially to consider whether the person concerned wa mentioned by name and whether any conduct likely to damage his or her reputation wa clearly attributed to that person while a false insinuation may have extremely serious consequence for the reputation of the individual concerned the fact that he or she is not expressly named may nevertheless in certain situation limit the effect of the remark in examining the compatibility of an interference with the requirement of article of the convention it is also necessary to determine the actual consequence of the remark to that end one must take account of the type of readership or audience for which the remark are intended and in particular the number and profession of the addressee we observe that the domestic court did not take these factor into consideration even though they were crucial for the examination of the case we also regret that the majority paid no heed to these question we would observe that in the present case the applicant decided not to mention the judge expressly by name leaving a certain ambiguity about the identity of the person concerned moreover the conduct imputed to judge x wa presented a follows wilfully making mistake by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence the remark combined observation of certain fact and subjective assessment of those fact the way in which the applicant expressed his remark somewhat lessened their forcefulness we would also note that the impugned remark were addressed to a restricted and specific readership consisting only of judge the general public were not informed of the content of the allegation disseminated to those judge in that context there are three major point to be highlighted firstly the various professional group are often bound together by a corporatist spirit and solidarity thus affecting the way they perceive criticism against their member secondly judge are naturally very wary about remark that are not supported by convincing evidence thirdly judge are used to receiving complaint sometimes very aggressive one from individual who are unhappy with judicial decision or indeed from their lawyer in most case such complaint have no concrete impact on the image of the judge thus criticised these various factor related to the specificity of the readership considerably lessen the consequence of the applicant remark it is questionable whether his letter had a real impact on the image of the judge concerned among that judge colleague criminal proceeding were brought against the applicant and he wa sentenced to a fine of euro for committing a criminal offence in addition the domestic court awarded the complainant judge euro in damage which is a significant sum in our view having regard to the nature of the remark made and the specificity of the very limited readership the sanction applied seen in the whole context is manifestly disproportionate in the circumstance of the case the majority justify the interference with the applicant freedom of expression not only by the need to protect a person reputation but also by the need to maintain the authority of the judiciary in this perspective the interference in question wa supposed to contribute to protecting the authority of the justice system in italy in our opinion on this point given the specific aspect of the case mentioned above the interference with the applicant freedom of expression is likely to have quite the opposite effect,,,
9,the applicant company have their seat in kokemäki the first applicant company satakunnan markkinapörssi oy ha been publishing veropörssi magazine since the magazine publishes yearly information about natural person taxable income and asset this information is public according to finnish law several other publication and medium company also publish such information the editorinchief of the

tietosuojavaltuutettu dataombudsmannen contacted the applicant company and advised them to stop publishing taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in collecting data which wa not to be published wa not forbidden the company declined because they felt that this request violated their freedom of expression by letter dated april the data protection ombudsman requested the data protection board tietosuojalautakunta datasekretessnämnden to order that the applicant company be forbidden to process taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in and to pas such data to an smsservice he claimed that under the personal data act the company had no right to establish such personal data register and that the derogation provided by the act concerning journalism did not apply to the present case the collecting of taxation information and the passing of such information to third party wa not journalism but processing of personal data which the applicant company had had no right to do on january the data protection board dismissed the request of the data protection ombudsman it found that the derogation provided by the personal data act concerning journalism applied to the present case a concerned the smsservice the data used in the service had already been published in veropörssi magazine and the act did not therefore apply to it by letter dated february the data protection ombudsman appealed to the helsinki administrative court hallintooikeus förvaltningsdomstolen reiterating his request that the applicant company be forbidden to process taxation information in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in and to pas such data to the smsservice on september the administrative court rejected the appeal it found that the derogation provided by the personal data act concerning journalism which had it origin in directive ec should not be interpreted too strictly a it would then favour protection of privacy over freedom of expression the court considered that veropörssi magazine had a journalistic purpose and that it wa also in the public interest to publish such data the court emphasised in particular that the published data wa public the derogation provided by the personal data act concerning journalism thus applied to the present case a concerned the smsservice the court agreed with the data protection board that a the information had already been published in the magazine the act did not apply to it by letter dated october the data protection ombudsman appealed further to the supreme administrative court korkein hallintooikeus högsta förvaltningsdomstolen reiterating the ground of appeal already presented before the administrative court on february the supreme administrative court decided to request a preliminary ruling from the court of justice of the european union on the interpretation of directive ec on december the court of justice of the european union sitting in a grand chamber composition gave it judgment see case c tietosuojavaltuutettu v satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy judgment of december grand chamber it found first of all that the activity in question constituted processing of personal data to which the directive applied moreover activity involving the processing of personal data such a that relating to personal data file which contained solely and in unaltered form material that had already been published in the medium also fell within the scope of the directive in order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society it wa necessary to interpret notion relating to that freedom such a journalism broadly however in order to achieve a balance between the two fundamental right the protection of the fundamental right to privacy required that the derogation and limitation in relation to the protection of data provided for in the directive had to apply only in so far a wa strictly necessary in conclusion activity such a those involved in the domestic proceeding relating to data from document which were in the public domain under national legislation could be classified a journalistic activity if their object wa to disclose to the public information opinion or idea irrespective of the medium which wa used to transmit them they were not limited to medium undertaking and could be undertaken for profitmaking purpose on september the supreme administrative court quashed the previous decision and referred the case back to the data protection board it requested the board to forbid the processing of taxation data in the manner and to the extent carried out in the court noted first that the term journalism wa not defined in directive ec but that according to the court of justice of the european union it wa necessary to interpret notion relating to freedom of expression such a journalism broadly however when balanced against the right to privacy any derogation to the latter were to be kept only to what wa strictly necessary when balancing the right to freedom of expression against the right to privacy the court had found that the decisive factor wa to ass whether a publication contributed to a public debate or wa solely intended to satisfy the curiosity of reader the supreme administrative court found that the publication of the whole database collected for journalistic purpose could not be regarded a journalistic activity the public interest did not require such publication of personal data to the extent seen in the present case in particular a the derogation in the personal data act wa to be interpreted strictly the same applied also to the smsservice the smsservice wa shut down after the decision of the supreme administrative court wa served on the applicant company the magazine continued publishing taxation data in autumn when it content wa only one fifth of the previous content since then the magazine ha not appeared on november the data protection board forbade the first applicant company to process taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in and to forward this information to an smsservice the second applicant company wa forbidden to collect save or forward to an smsservice any information received from the first applicant company register and published in veropörssi magazine by letter dated december after the data protection board had made it decision the data protection ombudsman asked the applicant company to indicate what measure they were envisaging to take in view of the board decision in their reply the applicant company asked the data protection ombudsman view on the condition under which they could continue publishing public taxation data at least to a certain extent in his reply the data protection ombudsman stated that according to the supreme administrative court decision the applicant company lacked the legal right to maintain their taxation database and to publish it and reminded them of his duty to report any breach of the personal data act to the police by letter dated february the applicant company appealed against the decision of the data protection board to the helsinki administrative court which transferred the case to the turku administrative court they complained that the decision violated the prohibition of censorship guaranteed by the constitution a well a their freedom of expression the finnish constitution provided better protection than the international human right treaty a the latter did not prohibit censorship fully according to the domestic law it wa not possible to prevent publication of information on the basis of the amount of information to be published or of the mean used for it publication nor wa it possible to use public interest a a criterion for preventing publication when preventive restriction of freedom of expression wa concerned accepting that would mean that the authority would be able to prevent publication if they thought that the publication did not promote discussion of a topic of public interest on october the turku administrative court rejected the applicant company appeal it found that a far a the matter had been decided by the supreme administrative court in it decision of september it could not take a stand on the issue in the latter decision the supreme administrative court had stated that the case wa not about the public nature of the taxation document nor about the right to publish such information a the court wa now examining only the decision rendered by the data protection board which wa issued a a result of the supreme administrative court decision of september it could not examine the issue which the supreme administrative court had excluded from the scope of it decision a the board decision corresponded to the content of the supreme administrative court decision there wa no reason to change it by letter dated november the applicant company appealed further to the supreme administrative court reiterating the ground of appeal already presented before the administrative court they noted in particular that the decision issued by the data protection board had prohibited the processing of taxation information for publishing purpose a well a requiring that the internal register of the first applicant company be protected in a manner required by the personal data act in practice the company were prevented from collecting information for publishing purpose which meant that there wa an interdiction to publish such information the company noted that the finnish constitution also prohibited indirect preventive censorship on june the supreme administrative court upheld the judgment of the administrative court it found that the case wa not about the right to publish taxation information a such nor about preventive censorship on these ground and the ground mentioned in the administrative court reasoning the court found that there wa no reason to change the latter decision ii relevant domestic lawa constitutional provision article of the constitution of finland suomen perustuslaki finland grundlag act no guarantee

to freedom of expression had been violated in a manner which wa not necessary in a democratic society the collection of taxation information wa not illegal a such and this information wa public the decision of the supreme administrative court meant in fact that the applicant company were put under prior censorship while other newspaper had been able to continue publishing such information also a wide audience had a right to receive information article of the convention read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the government observed that the applicant company application had not been lodged within the sixmonth timelimit regarding the first set of proceeding the present case involved two separate set of proceeding a the subjectmatters of these two set of proceeding were not the same the first set of proceeding concerned the question of whether the applicant company had processed personal taxation data unlawfully and the second set of proceeding the issuance of order for the processing of personal data consequently in their view in respect of the first set of proceeding the application should be declared inadmissible under article and of the convention the applicant company argued that the initial aim of the data protection ombudsman wa to obtain a publishing ban on the applicant company this wa not accomplished until the second round of the proceeding the proceeding could not be divided into two separate set of proceeding with independent and separable domestic remedy in each the supreme administrative court had referred the case back to the data protection board in september that court could also have issued the ban directly without referring the case back to the board the applicant company thus argued that their application had been lodged within the sixmonth timelimit regarding the first round of the proceeding the court note that the first round of the proceeding ended on september when the supreme administrative court quashed the lower decision and referred the case back to the data protection board a the case wa referred back to the data protection board there wa no final decision but the proceeding continued with the second round of the proceeding the domestic proceeding became final only on june when the supreme administrative court delivered it second and final decision in the case the court considers that a there wa only one final decision there wa only one set of proceeding although the case wa examined twice before the different level of jurisdiction the court therefore reject the government preliminary objection concerning the first round of the proceeding and considers that the complaint under article is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that this complaint is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submissionsa the applicant company the applicant company noted that taxation data wa public in finland and that anyone could have access to it in this respect the taxation data differed crucially from for example medical record finnish taxation data had been and continued to be published in newspaper and website this activity had been the subject of profound discussion in the context of which the legislator had decided to maintain public access to taxation data publishing public taxation data had thus been accepted by the finnish legislator annually on november when the taxation record of the preceding year became public numerous newspaper and other medium continuously published varying amount of taxation data in printed paper and website and this publishing wa not in any relevant manner different from the applicant company activity the applicant company argued that there wa no prescription of proactive limitation to the freedom of expression in the personal data act or in other legislation referred to by the government such limitation were a they should be retrospective the prohibition on processing taxation data de facto also prohibited the applicant company from publishing it this publishing activity wa also de facto the sole reason for the prohibition processing of taxation data wa forbidden insofar a such data wa to be published in other word collecting and publishing taxation data which wa not to be published wa not forbidden therefore the prohibition constituted a proactive ban also known a censorship which wa strictly against the finnish constitution the applicant company maintained that the personal data act did not prescribe restriction to freedom of expression the act wa not at all intended to be applied to such personal data which wa to be published a the journalistic exception wa to be applied to the personal data register which were meant to support actual publishing however any possibility of limiting basic fundamental right such a freedom of expression should be explicitly provided by law on the other hand the preparatory work of the act on the public disclosure and confidentiality of taxation information indicated that publishing even large amount of tax data wa accepted by the legislator the restriction were thus not prescribed by law a to the necessity in a democratic society the applicant company noted that publishing of taxation data wa common frequent and expressly accepted by the finnish legislator they asked what the pressing social need wa that demanded limiting their publishing activity while other newspaper and website continued to publish taxation data in finland according to the government the matter wa not examined a a potential limitation to freedom of expression but a handling of personal data to the applicant company these two issue could not be effectively separated from each other in the way the finnish authority had done in the present case prior to publishing data needed to be collected and processed this wa done by practically all finnish newspaper it wa true that the extent of the information published by the applicant company wa different to that practised by other publisher but the manner of publishing wa the same taxation data wa customarily published in catalogue form with few if any comment the protection of privacy had not during previous decade been a ground to prevent other medium from publishing information on taxable income of ordinary person the applicant company noted that in the present case the limitation to their freedom of expression on the basis of the estimated general interest had been made prior to the publication the mere possibility of proactively censoring a newspaper on the basis of lacking general interest of it content or on the basis of it content in the first place wa in the applicant company view very dangerous for democracy the supreme administrative court conception of journalism wa in contradiction with that of the court of justice of the european union according to which it wa to be interpreted broadly not strictly the content of journalism did not change with the amount of information publishedb the government the government argued that in the special circumstance of the case banning the applicant company from processing taxation data did not constitute an interference with the applicant company right to freedom of expression within the meaning of article of the convention were the court to have another opinion such interference wa in any event prescribed by law and it wa necessary in a democratic society the government noted that the impugned measure had had a basis in finnish law especially in various provision of the personal data act these measure had been taken for the protection of the reputation or right of others in particular for the protection of private life a to the necessity in a democratic society the government noted that the extensive publication in unaltered form without journalistic comment of individual taxation data which wa public a such had mainly satisfied the curiosity of the reader such processing conflicted with the personal data act the purpose of which wa to implement the protection of private life and other basic right safeguarding the right to privacy during the processing of personal data the public availability of taxation data in finland in general wa exceptional in europe a many eu member state classified such data a private access to public information did not entail that such information could always be published but the publishing should always serve the interest of public debate the government observed that the case had been thoroughly examined by the national authority and court the supreme administrative court had assessed the matter in both set of proceeding before it a a question of balancing the right to freedom of expression on the one hand and the right to private life on the other hand it had found inter alia that this assessment should take into account to what extent an open discussion of general interest and necessity in a democratic society or the control of public use of power or the freedom of criticism did not require the publishing of personal data concerning individual to the now meant extent the government thus considered that the reason relied on by the domestic court were relevant and sufficient for the purpose of article of the convention the government considered also that the sanction imposed on the applicant company had been reasonable in it decision of november the data protection board had expressly stated that the first applicant company had been permitted to process personal data to the extent that the data had been used exclusively for journalistic activity and processed for journalistic purpose provided that the first applicant company protected the data appropriately furthermore the first applicant company had never been prohibited generally from publishing the information in question it could therefore if it so wished have changed it activity so a to comply with the personal data act moreover the matter did not concern prior censorship a it did not concern the right to publish taxation data a such but the handling of the personal data the case wa not about a possible prior interference with the content of the publication but about the assessment of the legal precondition set for the handling of personal data with the aim of ensuring the protection of private life referring to the margin of appreciation the government considered that the domestic court had struck a fair balance between the competing interest and that the impugned interference had been necessary in a democratic society there wa thus no violation of article of the convention the court assessmenta whether there wa an interference the court note that the party disagree on whether the ban imposed on the applicant company constitutes an interference with their right to freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the convention according to the government banning the applicant company from processing taxation data did not constitute an interference with the applicant company right to freedom of expression while the applicant company claimed that it did referring in this respect even to censorship the court note that in november the data protection board forbade the first applicant company to process taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in and to forward this information to an smsservice the second applicant company wa forbidden to collect save or forward to an smsservice any information received from the first applicant company register and published in the magazine a a result veropörssi magazine published taxation data once more in autumn when it content wa only one fifth of the previous content since then the magazine ha not appeared the smsservice had already been shut down earlier the court considers that the prohibition issued by the data protection board did not prevent the applicant company from publishing taxation data a such however it prohibited them from collecting saving and processing such data to a large extent with the result that an essential part of the information previously published in veropörssi magazine could no longer be published it must therefore be considered that there wa an interference with the applicant company right to impart information a guaranteed by article of the conventionb whether the interference wa prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim the court note that the party also disagree on whether the interference wa prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim according to the government the impugned measure had a basis in finnish law especially in various provision of the personal data act and these measure were taken for the protection of the reputation or right of others in particular for the protection of private life on the contrary the applicant company maintained that the personal data act did not prescribe any restriction to freedom of expression and that this act wa not at all intended to be applied to such personal data which wa to be published the journalistic exception provided by the act wa to be applied to the personal data register which were meant to support actual publishing the court note that the right to impart information is subject to the exception set out in article of the convention the court accepts that the interference wa based on the provision of the personal data act a in force at the relevant time in the present case the question before the domestic court wa whether the journalistic exception provided by the personal data act wa applicable to the applicant company case in other word the question wa whether in their case the domestic law a interpreted by the domestic court allowed exception to be made from the protection of private life in favour of the freedom of expression the court therefore considers that the interference wa prescribed by law and it pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or right of others within the meaning of article c whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society according to the court wellestablished caselaw freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article of the convention it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society this freedom is subject to the exception set out in article which must however be strictly construed the need for any restriction must be established convincingly see for example nilsen and johnsen v norway gc no echr viii and lingens v austria july series a no the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with a european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article see janowski v poland gc no echr i the court task in exercising it supervision is not to take the place of national authority but rather to review under article in the light of the case a a whole the decision they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation see among many other authority fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction the court must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case a a whole in particular it must determine whether the interference in issue wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it were relevant and sufficient see janowski v poland cited above news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i barfod v denmark february series a no lingens v austria cited above and sunday time v the united kingdom no april series a no in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see jersild v denmark september series a no the court further emphasis the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society although the press must not overstep certain bound particularly a regard the reputation and right of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information it duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with it obligation and responsibility information and idea on all matter of public interest see bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii de haes and gijsels v belgium february report of judgment and decision i and jersild v denmark cited above not only do the medium have the task of imparting such information and idea the public also ha a right to receive them see for example sunday time v the united kingdom no cited above the court ha recently set out the relevant principle to be applied when examining the necessity of an instance of interference with the right to freedom of expression in the interest of the protection of the reputation or right of others it noted that in such case the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authority struck a fair balance when protecting two value guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain case namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see axel springer ag v germany gc no february and mgn limited v the united kingdom no january in von hannover v germany no gc no and echr and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above the court defined the contracting state margin of appreciation and it own role in balancing these two conflicting interest the court went on to identify a number of criterion a being relevant where the right of freedom of expression is being balanced against the right to respect for private life see von hannover v germany no gc cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above namelyi contribution to a debate of general interestii how wellknown is the person concerned and what is the subject of the reportiii prior conduct of the person concernediv method of obtaining the information and it veracitycircumstances in which the photograph were takenv content form and consequence of the publication andvi severity of the sanction imposed turning to the fact of the present case the court note that the applicant company were not a such forbidden to publish taxation data in veropörssi magazine however they were forbidden to collect save or process taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in and to forward this information to an smsservice a a result the applicant company published one more issue of veropörssi magazine in autumn with one fifth of the previous content since then the magazine ha not appeared the smsservice had already been shut down earlier in order to ass whether the necessity of the restriction of the exercise of the freedom of expression ha been established convincingly the court must examine whether the balancing exercise between the freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life ha been undertaken by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the court considers first of all that the general subjectmatter which wa at the heart of the publication in question namely the taxation data about natural person taxable income and asset wa already a matter of public record in finland and a such wa considered to be a matter of public interest from the point of view of the general public right to receive information about matter of public interest and thus from the standpoint of the press there were justified ground for imparting such information to the public the court note that in veropörssi magazine published taxation data on million person taxable income and asset these person must have included both wellknown personality and ordinary citizen according to the specific act on the public disclosure and confidentiality of tax information this taxation information is public in finland there is thus no suggestion that the published information wa obtained by subterfuge or other illicit mean compare von hannover v germany no echr vi on the contrary the published information wa received directly from the tax authority moreover the court observes that the accuracy of the published information wa not in dispute even before the domestic court there is no evidence or indeed any allegation of factual error misrepresentation or bad faith on the part of the applicant company see in this connection flinkkilä and others v finland no april the court note that the only problematic issue for the national authority and court wa the extent of the published information according to them the publishing of taxation information to such an extent a in could not be considered a journalism but a processing of personal data which the applicant company had no right to do the central question thus turned on the concept of journalism a the derogation provided by the personal data act concerning journalism had it origin in directive ec the supreme administrative court decided to request a preliminary ruling from the court of justice of the european union on the interpretation of directive ec in that respect the court note that the court of justice of the european union found in it preliminary ruling that in order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society it wa necessary to interpret notion relating to that freedom such a journalism broadly however in order to achieve a balance between the two fundamental right the protection of the fundamental right to privacy required that the derogation and limitation in relation to the protection of data provided for in the directive had to apply only in so far a wa strictly necessary in conclusion the court found that activity such a those involved in the case at hand relating to data from document which were in the public domain under national legislation could be classified a journalistic activity if their object wa to disclose to the public information opinion or idea irrespective of the medium which wa used to transmit them the court note that after having received the preliminary ruling from the court of justice of the european union the supreme administrative court found that the publication of the whole database collected for journalistic purpose could not be regarded a journalistic activity it considered that the public interest did not require such publication of personal data to the extent that had been seen in the present case in particular a the derogation in the personal data act wa to be interpreted strictly the same applied also to the smsservice the court observes that in it analysis the supreme administrative court attached importance both to the applicant company right to freedom of expression a well a to the right to respect for private life of those taxpayer whose taxation information had been published the court examined the case on the basis of principle embodied in article and the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the supreme administrative court thus balanced in it reasoning the applicant company right to freedom of expression against the right to privacy according to the supreme administrative court it wa thus necessary to interpret the applicant company freedom of expression strictly in order to protect the right to privacy the court find this reasoning acceptable the restriction on the exercise of the applicant company freedom of expression were established convincingly by the supreme administrative court taking into account the court caselaw the court reiterates it recent caselaw according to which the court would require in such circumstance strong reason to substitute it own view for that of the domestic court see von hannover v germany no gc cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above lastly a concern the sanction the court note that the applicant company were not prohibited generally from publishing the information in question but only to a certain extent nothing prevented them from continuing to publish taxation information to a lesser extent than they had done in the fact that in practice the limitation imposed on the quantity of the information to be published may have rendered the applicant company business activity unviable is not however a direct consequence of the action taken by the domestic court and authority but an economic decision made by the applicant company themselves it must also be taken into account that the prohibition laid down by the domestic authority can not be considered a a criminal sanction but a an administrative one and thereby a le severe sanction than a criminal one contrast and compare lehideux and isorni v france september report of judgment and decision vii in conclusion the reason relied on by the domestic court and authority were both relevant and sufficient to show that the interference complained of wa necessary in a democratic society having regard to all the foregoing factor and taking into account the margin of appreciation afforded to the state in this area the court considers that the domestic court struck a fair balance between the competing interest at stake there ha therefore been no violation of article of the convention ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant company complained under article of the convention of the length of the administrative proceeding which had lasted for more than eight year article of the convention read in the relevant part a follows in the determination of his civil right and obligation everyone is entitled to a hearing within a reasonable time by a tribunal the government contested that argument a admissibility the government observed that the applicant company application had not been lodged within the sixmonth timelimit regarding the first set of proceeding the present case involved two separate set of proceeding a the subjectmatters of these two set of proceeding were not the same the first set of proceeding concerned the question of whether the applicant company had processed personal taxation data unlawfully and the second set of proceeding the issuance of order for the processing of personal data consequently in their view the application should be declared in respect of the first set of proceeding inadmissible under article and of the convention the applicant company argued that the initial aim of the data protection ombudsman wa to impose a publishing ban on the applicant company this wa not accomplished until the second round of the proceeding the proceeding could not be divided into two separate set of proceeding each with independent and separable domestic remedy the supreme administrative court had referred the case back to the data protection board in september that court could also have issued the ban directly without referring the case back to the board the applicant company thus argued that their application had been lodged within the sixmonth timelimit regarding the first round of the proceeding referring to it conclusion concerning the sixmonth rule see paragraph above the court note that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submissionsa the applicant company the applicant company argued that the entire period of eight year had been about the same legal question namely whether it wa legal to collect process and eventually to publish taxation information in the applicant company magazine it had been within the power of the supreme administrative court to issue the ban directly without referring the case back to the data protection board this could have been done in the name of the applicant company fundamental right to a fair trial within a reasonable time a guaranteed by article of the convention the applicant company had not initiated these proceeding and in their view it bore little relevance of what these proceeding consisted the legal uncertainty concerning the publication of the applicant company magazine had in fact lasted even longer a already on june the ministry of justice had initiated a criminal investigation concerning the publishing of the magazine the ministry had also requested a statement from the data protection ombudsman for the applicant company this uncertainty had thus lasted for yearsb the government the government argued that the proceeding concerning the preliminary ruling from the court of justice of the european union had lasted for one year and ten month when excluding this duration the length of the first set of proceeding wa three year and three month the criminal investigation initiated in had concerned a different subjectmatter to the proceeding now at stake the second set of proceeding had lasted for two year and three month the government noted that none of the procedural stage had lasted very long approximately one and a half year for each stage the case had involved two separate set of proceeding a the subjectmatter of the two set of proceeding wa not the same in spite of the fact that the proceeding related to the same party and the same fact the first set of proceeding had concerned the issue of whether the applicant company had processed personal data in conflict with the provision of the personal data act the supreme administrative court had quashed the appealed decision and referred the matter back to the data protection board which had to conduct a new administrative consideration of the matter and to make a new administrative decision the second set of proceeding had concerned the question of whether the data protection board new decision of november had corresponded to the previous supreme administrative court decision the government noted that the matter had been exceptionally demanding from the legal point of view the proceeding had included the drafting of a request for a preliminary ruling and there had been more hearing than usual in view of the particular circumstance of the case the proceeding had been conducted within a reasonable time within the meaning of article of the convention the court assessment the court note that the period to be taken into consideration began on february when the data protection board first decision wa appealed against and ended on june when the supreme administrative court gave a final decision in the case however the case wa pending before the court of justice of the european union for a preliminary ruling for one year and ten month which according to the court caselaw to be excluded from the length attributable to the domestic authority see pafitis and others v greece february report of judgment and decision i and koua poirrez v france no echr x when deducting this duration from the overall duration the impugned proceeding before the domestic authority and court lasted over six year and six month at two level of jurisdiction of which both level twice the court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceeding must be assessed in the light of the circumstance of the case and with reference to the following criterion the complexity of the case the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authority and what wa at stake for the applicant in the dispute see among many other authority frydlender v france gc no echr vii the court agrees with the government that there ha not been any particularly long period of inactivity on the part of the authority and domestic court the proceeding were pending before the domestic authority and court for approximately one and a half year for each stage which can not be considered excessive the excessive total length seems to have been caused by the fact that the case wa examined twice by each level of jurisdiction the court considers that even though the case wa of some complexity it can not be said that this in itself justified the entire length of the proceeding some of this complexity may have been caused by the fact that the case wa referred back to the data protection board for a new examination the court ha frequently found a violation of article of the convention in case raising issue similar to the one in the present case see frydlender v france cited above having examined all the material submitted to it the court considers that even taking into account the complexity of the case the government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case having regard to it caselaw on the subject the court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceeding wa excessive and failed to meet the reasonable time requirement there ha accordingly been a breach of article of the convention iii alleged violation of article of the convention lastly the applicant company complained under article of the convention that they had been discriminated against visàvis other newspaper which had been able to continue publishing the information in question article of the convention read a follows the enjoyment of the right and freedom set forth in the convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such a sex race colour language religion political or other opinion national or social origin association with a national minority property birth or other status the government contested that argument admissibility the government observed that it did not appear from the case file that the applicant company had relied on article of the convention a such or in conjunction with article of the convention before the domestic court or authority they had thus not exhausted the domestic remedy available to them and this part of the application should therefore be declared inadmissible under article and of the convention in any event the government noted that the situation of other publisher of taxation information wa not comparable or analogous with that of the applicant company a they had not published information in the same manner and to the same extent a the applicant company the domestic court had not examined the matter a one of placing different publisher in different position but rather a a question of handling personal data in the applicant company publication the conduct of the domestic authority could therefore not be considered a amounting to discrimination under article of the convention taken in conjunction with article of the convention were the court to have another opinion the government considered that the difference in treatment had pursued a legitimate aim of protecting the private life of others and it had been reasonable to the aim pursued accordingly there had been no violation of article of the convention taken in conjunction with article of the convention the applicant company claimed that they had made comparison with other taxation data publisher before every domestic instance and that they had relied on both their right to equal treatment and freedom of expression they might not have relied on article of the convention expressly but they had certainly made claim and argument based on their right to equal treatment when assessing potential limitation to their freedom of expression the applicant company claimed that their complaint under article wa admissible the applicant company further noted that publishing of taxation data wa common frequent and expressly accepted by the finnish legislator such data wa annually published by numerous newspaper it wa not restricted to person of public interest but any person with taxable income exceeding euro wa almost certainly mentioned in some printed national newspaper or on a national website none of this publishing had been restricted nor any attempt made to restrict it by any finnish authority article of the convention had thus been violated a the applicant company had been prevented from publishing such information while the other newspaper and medium had not the court doe not consider it necessary to examine the government preliminary objection concerning the nonexhaustion of domestic remedy a it find this complaint in any case inadmissible for the reason set out below the court note that article of the convention complement the other substantive provision of the convention and it protocol it ha no independent existence since it ha effect solely in relation to the enjoyment of the right and freedom safeguarded by those provision although the application of article doe not presuppose a breach of those provision and to this extent it is autonomous there can be no room for it application unless the fact at issue fall within the ambit of one or more of the latter see for instance eb v france gc no january and vallianatos and others v greece gc no and echr the court note that in the present case it is undisputed that the applicant company situation fall within the notion of freedom of expression within the meaning of article of the convention consequently article taken in conjunction with article of the convention applies the court ha established in it caselaw that in order for an issue to arise under article there must be a difference in treatment of person in relevantly similar situation such a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it ha no objective and reasonable justification in other word if it doe not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the mean employed and the aim sought to be realised the contracting state enjoy a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent difference in otherwise similar situation justify a difference in treatment see burden v the united kingdom gc no echr turning to the present case the court note that the applicant company complaint under article of the convention relate to the prohibition imposed on them preventing them from publishing taxation data to a certain extent while other newspaper allegedly were able to publish such information the applicant company are thus comparing their situation to that of the other newspaper engaged in publishing taxation information the court observes that the applicant company were prohibited from publishing taxation data to the extent they had done in when they had published data on million person taxable income and asset it is not known to what extent the other newspaper published such information nor is it known what wa considered by the domestic authority a an acceptable quantity to be published it appears that the applicant company were never prevented from publishing taxation data to the same extent a the other newspaper but only to an extent which clearly exceeded the quantity published by the others the applicant company can not thus be compared with other newspaper publishing taxation data a the quantity published by them wa clearly greater than elsewhere and there is thus no point of comparison available the applicant company can not therefore claim to be in the same situation a the other newspaper the court therefore considers that the applicant company situation is not sufficiently similar to the situation of the other newspaper it follows that this part of the application is manifestly illfounded and must be declared inadmissible under article a and of the convention iv application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court find that there ha been a violation of the convention or the protocol thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party a damage the applicant company claimed euro eur in respect of pecuniary damage for the loss of income for one year the government considered that there wa no causal link between the alleged violation of article of the convention and the damage claimed were the court of a different opinion the applicant company had not provided sufficient proof of the amount claimed therefore it could not be said that the damage complained of wa actually caused by the alleged violation of article of the convention this claim should therefore be rejected were the court of a different opinion the question of the application of article should be reserved moreover the government noted that the applicant company had not claimed any pecuniary damage in respect of alleged violation of article or of the convention nor any nonpecuniary damage and that consequently no such compensation could be awarded the court doe not discern any causal link between the violation found under article of the convention and the pecuniary damage alleged by the applicant company the court therefore reject this claim a to the nonpecuniary damage the court note that the applicant company have made no claim under that heading b cost and expense the applicant company also claimed eur for the cost and expense incurred before the domestic court and the court the government noted that it wa not clear whether all cost claimed related to the present case moreover there wa no specification related to all cost and expense a required by the rule of court the government considered that the applicant company claim were excessive a to quantum in their view the compensation for cost and expense should not exceed with respect to the domestic proceeding eur inclusive of valueadded tax and with respect to the proceeding before the court eur inclusive of valueadded tax according to the court caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of cost and expense only in so far a it ha been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable a to quantum in the present case regard being had to the document in it possession and the above criterion the court considers it reasonable to award the sum of eur inclusive of valueadded tax covering cost under all head c default interest the court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the european central bank to which should be added three percentage point for these reason the court declares by a majority the complaint concerning the freedom of expression and the length of the proceeding admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible hold by six vote to one that there ha been no violation of article of the convention hold unanimously that there ha been a violation of article of the convention hold unanimouslya that the respondent state is to pay the applicant company within three month from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with article of the convention the following amount eur nine thousand five hundred euro plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant in respect of cost and expensesb that from the expiry of the abovementioned three month until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage point dismisses by six vote to one the remainder of the applicant company claim for just satisfaction done in english and notified in writing on july pursuant to rule and of the rule of court fatoş aracıguido raimondi deputy registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the following separate opinion are annexed to this judgmenta concurring opinion of judge nicolaoub dissenting opinion of judge tsotsoria grafaconcurring opinion of judge nicolaou in striking a balance between the applicant company right to freedom of expression and the right to personal privacy of others under respectively article and of the convention the supreme administrative court had regard inter alia to directive ec of the european parliament and of the council of october on the protection of individual with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data oj l p this directive which aim at protecting individual from the adverse effect of the processing and flow of tax data of a personal nature while at the same time enjoins state to provide exemption or derogation in order that freedom of expression may also be safeguarded in furtherance of the public interest is itself sensitive to the need of getting the balance right see article of the directive a well a recital of it preamble article provides in this regard that member state shall provide for exemption or derogation for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purpose or the purpose of artistic or literary expression only if they are necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with the rule governing freedom of expression upon request by the supreme administrative court for a preliminary ruling on question relevant to the interpretation of the directive in the light of the matter at issue the court of justice of the european union sitting in grand chamber gave a ruling the gist of which wa a that the notion of journalism is to be interpreted broadly and therefore the activity of the applicant company may be classified a journalistic but that it wa for the national court to decide whether those activity were solely for journalistic purpose or in other word whether the sole object of those activity wa the disclosure to the public of information opinion or idea and b that any derogation and limitation were to apply only in so far a strictly necessary the supreme administrative court then proceeded with the examination of the case fully following the guidance received from the cjeu it concluded that in the circumstance the activity in question could not be regarded a activity pursued solely for journalistic purpose that the public interest did not in the present context require the publication of personal data to such an extent and that therefore the limitation in relation to the protection of data did not apply consequently it requested the data protection board to issue a prohibition this outcome entailed economic loss for the applicant company basically in the form of profit the supreme administrative court did not include this aspect in the matter that needed to be taken into account in my opinion it wa right not to have done so to have attributed importance to such loss would have been to envisage the possibility that protection under the directive might be defeated if the loss wa high a could be the case where the infringement wa on a particularly large scale while protection would remain only if the loss wa relatively low i am not prepared to countenance that yet that is what the majority now do in paragraph of the judgment the loss allegedly sustained by the applicant company is firstly viewed a a sanction against them in my view it wa not a sanction then it is said that the loss is not however a direct consequence of the action taken by the domestic court and authority but an economic decision made by the applicant company themselves i am bound to say with respect that i am not quite sure what exactly that mean but it certainly seems to effectively neutralize the idea of a sanction still the idea of a sanction is repeated immediately further down in the same paragraph the prohibition to publish is described a an administrative sanction and a such le severe than a criminal sanction but no further reference is made to financial loss i am unable to associate myself with this line of reasoning there wa certainly an interference with the applicant company right to publish however that interference wa obviously justified a necessary and proportional on the basis of the balancing carried out by the supreme administrative court in the context of the applicable legal framework and in light of strasbourg caselaw having regard to what this case wa about i consider that to have been enough a i have already indicated any loss sustained by the applicant company wa merely incidental to what wa at stake it wa not an integral part of the consideration that had to be balanced and could not therefore have had any impact on the outcome dissenting opinion of judge tsotsoria i dissent from the majority conclusion that there ha been no violation of article of the convention in this case the core of this case is the right to freedom of expression in particular freedom of the press a exercised by the applicant company the issue at hand wa the restriction on processing lawfully available taxation data concerning natural person taxable income and asset in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in when the applicant company had published data on million taxpayer and forwarded this information to an sm service such taxation data constituted a matter of public record and a subject of public interest in finland see paragraph of the judgment freedom of expression is essential to a democratic society to uphold and protect it and to respect it diversity and it political social and cultural mission is the mandate of all government article of the convention guarantee not only the right to impart information but also the right of the public to receive it see among other authority ahmet yıldırım v turkey no echr and observer and guardian v the united kingdom november b series a no any measure interfering with the right of the medium to convey information other than where limitation have been explicitly prescribed by law do a disservice to democracy and often even endanger it see mutatis mutandis fáber v hungary no july with further reference therein with a certain degree of hesitation i align myself with the conclusion of the majority that the interference with the applicant company freedom of expression wa prescribed by the personal data act and that it pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or right of others i also have doubt a to whether this case should have been analysed according to the criterion developed in von hannover v germany no gc no and echr and axel springer ag v germany gc no february see paragraph of the judgment be that a it may after applying the abovementioned criterion the judgment concludes and i subscribe to this conclusion that the activity of the applicant company which contributed to a debate on a matter of public interest raised no question a to their compliance with the standard of responsible journalism and their good faith ha not been called into question see paragraph of the judgment the only problematic area for the national authority and court wa the extent of the published information which would determine whether the activity of the applicant company fell under the notion of journalism or processing of personal data which the applicant company had no right to do see paragraph of the judgment the conclusion reached by the majority here served a the basis for shifting the balance from the applicant company freedom of expression article to the protection of the private life of the taxpayer concerned article i do not consider that the judgment ha persuasively ascertained that the prescribed limitation on processing and consequently publishing taxation data were necessary for the protection of the right to privacy of either specific individual or of society a a whole therefore i do not agree with the majority that such measure were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued importantly the judgment doe not follow the established caselaw finding a violation of article in case where government have taken measure to protect publicly available and known information on matter of public interest from disclosure see for example observer and guardian cited above and fressoz and roire v france gc no and echr i the judgment upholds the decision of the domestic authority to restrict the processing of taxation data which have been openly available and in the public domain in finland under the act on the public disclosure and confidentiality of tax information thus affecting the capacity of the applicant company to publish such data i consider that this restriction serf a a form of censorship that a such is incompatible with democracy moreover restricting the right and duty of newspaper to purvey information that is already available on a matter of legitimate public concern ha been held to endanger democracy and to be characteristic of a totalitarian regime a lord bridge put it in the observer and guardian case cited above the domestic authority gave a broad interpretation endorsed by the majority of the concept of respect for the private life of taxpayer in relation to the processing and subsequent publication of their taxation data the decision by the supreme administrative court of finland to impose the restriction wa made on the ground of the abstract and hypothetical need to protect privacy no negative effect or harm wa identified a having been inflicted upon any individual nor had society been otherwise imperilled through publication of these data moreover the publishing of taxation data ha not been considered to jeopardise the privacy of taxpayer in finland even though a number of newspaper and website have continuously published such data see paragraph of the judgment without sustainable ground to believe that the right of privacy ha been violated or that an imminentreal danger of such a violation existed the imposition of severe restriction on medium freedom can not serve the legitimate interest of society regrettably the majority agreed with the respondent state that the applicant company activity did not fall within the exception for the purpose of journalism in the personal data act see paragraph of the judgment it should be recalled that the inalienable element of journalism are data collection interpretation and storytelling the judgment however could lead to an interpretation that journalist are so limited in processing data that the entire journalistic activity becomes futile this may be the case especially in circumstance where there are continuous effort to limit freedom of expression particularly in the light of the dynamic and evolving character of the medium the judgment doe not follow the postulate that any interference with freedom of expression must be convincingly established and narrowly interpreted see for example hertel v switzerland august report of judgment and decision vi by limiting the opportunity to publish data already disclosed to the public the national authority restricted the contribution of the applicant company to debate on question of public interest see sürek v turkey no gc no echr iv and morice v france gc no april another aspect of the judgment that may lead to further restriction on freedom of expression is the linking of journalistic activity to the extent of the information published establishing a quantitative framework for publicly available information and limiting the freedom guaranteed by article on this ground doe not correspond to the notion of a pressing social need it is vital that freedom of expression is safeguarded against vague and disproportionate interference such an interpretation of the term journalistic activity can not be in the best interest of a democratic society a understood in the caselaw of the court this interpretation also deviate from the approach developed by the court of justice of the european union to the interpretation of directive ec see paragraph and of the judgment the court should have construed and assessed the journalistic activity of the applicant company against the backdrop of the essential role played by the medium including the press in a democratic society and the fact that all person who exercise their freedom of expression including journalist undertake duty and responsibility the scope of which depends on their situation and the technical mean they use see for example handyside v the united kingdom december series a no the respondent state should not have been afforded a wide margin of appreciation in the particular circumstance of the case see for example fressoz and roire cited above and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii the question of the nature and severity of the measure taken by the domestic authority is also a matter of concern in paragraph the court concludes that the interference by the domestic authority with the applicant company activity amounted to sanction albeit necessary and proportionate one i agree with judge nicolaous view a expressed in his concurring opinion that they were not sanction a such contrast and compare with weber v switzerland may series a no öztürk v turkey gc no echr vi and özgür gündem v turkey no echr iii nonetheless the decision of the domestic authority entailed an extremely serious interference with the applicant company activity in practice while publishing a such wa not prohibited the domestic authority decision prevented the applicant company to a certain extent from processing data for publishing purpose this led to futile attempt to continue publishing such data a a result the measure imposed not only limited the company participation in and contribution to debate on matter of legitimate concern see for example lingens v austria no july bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above and mosley v the united kingdom no may but also led to the discontinuation of publication in addition this would inevitably have had financial consequence for the applicant company hence the severity of the measure imposed should have played a role in the proportionality analysis in the light of the foregoing and given the interest a democratic society ha in ensuring and preserving freedom of the press i believe that the national authority in the particular circumstance of the case did not apply standard in conformity with the principle embodied in article of the convention and overstepped the margin of appreciation afforded to them consequently the court should have exercised it supervisory function and should have concluded that the interference with the applicant company right to freedom of expression wa not necessary in a democratic society this should have resulted in an award of just satisfaction to the applicant company under article of the convention european charter on freedom of the press b van der haak m park m castells the future of journalism networked journalism international journal of

10,in and life in kragujevac at the relevant time he wa an editorinchief of svetlost a weekly news magazine based in the same city the applicant wa represented by m d rakićević a lawyer practising in kragujevac the government were represented by their agent m z jadrijević mladar the fact of the case a submitted by the party may be summarised a follows the published article on august svetlost published an article entitled the city chief undertaker ccu mr a from a smuggler to a rich man glavni gradski grobar gggr g a od švercera do bogatuna the subtitle just below state that before you decide to die ask ccu a to whether you can do so since in kragujevac only the privileged have this right pre nego što odlučite da umrete pitajte gggr da li možete to da uradite jer u kragujevcu to pravo imaju samo privilegovani the article itself written by m b a journalist employed with svetlost in so far a referred to by the domestic court read a follows in connection with an earlier case allegedly involving the building of a family crypt in the centre of the kragujevac cemetery by a local businessman referred to a pharaoh a case which greatly agitated the citizen of kragujevac because of the digging up of multiple existing graf ccu stated that all this wa lawful and marketbased enforcing discipline against the dead and calling out the living for their debt ccu just like any other debt enforcer started issuing threat of a most bizarre nature which this journalist can not now convey for the sake of decency if we were a state based on the rule of law and a civil society this man would have to be removed from his position immediately for not being up to it both a a person and professionally instead walking bravely in his gianfranco ferré shoe he is successfully leading the city public burial company although ccus career seems fantastic it wa not easy to travel for such a short time the road from being a transitional loser and a cigarette smuggler to being a person wearing gianfranco ferré shoe and living the high life at a time when thousand of expert and hard worker were losing their job ccu went in another direction and from an ordinary worker three year of vocational school and a street cigarette smuggler became a director of the city cemetery about whose high income both official and more often unofficial under the counter there are fantastical story being told throughout the city through the constant increase in the price of death and personal human tragedy ccu is building his successful career at the time when the case referred to in paragraph of this article happened ccu left one political party and joined another one whose bos ordered him to sell to the kragujevac pharaoh the centre of the old city cemetery leaving nothing to chance ccu managed to secure for himself two diploma just in case they were needed they may come in handy and it sound better when introducing oneself a part of the above article there wa also a photograph of mr a referred to by his name and surname and an explanation that it wa taken on the occasion of a public presentation of a book about graveyard promocija monografije o grobljima the civil proceeding in august mr a lodged a civil defamation claim against the applicant m b and svetlost regarding the published article and the said photograph on september the kragujevac high court viši sud u kragujevcu ruled partly in favour of mr a and ordered the applicant m b and svetlost to pay him jointly i serbian dinar rsd equivalent to approximately euro eur at the time on account of the mental anguish which he had suffered a a consequence of the breach of his honour and reputation ii rsd equivalent to approximately eur at the time for the violation of his right to privacy and iii rsd in litigation cost equivalent to approximately eur at the time all with statutory interest a of the date of adjudication the kragujevac high court explained inter alia that there had been no justified interest for the public to be informed about mr a private life including a regard how he had opted to dress in any event according to his own statement which the court accepted mr a had never worn italian shoe and had properly obtained his diploma he had however used to sell cigarette for a while the respondent had furthermore failed to verify the other allegation against mr a thus harming his honour and his reputation in particular the court could not accept that the allegation regarding the functioning of the public burial company had been based on a press conference which had taken place in or on statement which had been given by a number of it former employee a suggested by the respondent since there wa no evidence in support of those claim in fact the witness including the mayor personally who had been heard in the course of the proceeding all explicitly stated otherwise following the publication of the article mr a had been contacted by many friend colleague and business partner a well a by the mayor they had all wanted to know whether the allegation contained in the article were accurate which in turn had caused him great mental anguish the respondent had likewise failed to obtain the consent of mr a for the publication of the photograph in question the remaining text including the title and the subtitle amounted to a mixture of value judgment and unverified statement of fact which had been intended to belittle mr a person in breach of the relevant journalistic and ethical standard on december the kragujevac appeal court apelacioni sud u kragujevcu upheld the kragujevac high court ruling a regard the compensation which had been awarded to mr a on account of the mental anguish suffered due to the breach of his honour and his reputation at the same time however the appellate court rejected altogether mr a claim for compensation regarding the violation of his privacy in connection with the photograph which had been published a part of the article and amended the amount which had been awarded for litigation cost to rsd equivalent to approximately eur at the time in it reasoning which wa otherwise essentially along the line of the reason which had been offered at first instance the kragujevac appeal court pointed out inter alia that mr a wa not entitled to any compensation for the alleged violation of his privacy since he had been a public function holder and the photograph in question had been taken during a public event related to the performance of his duty mr a consent had therefore not been necessary for it publication the above ruling relied on inter alia some of the relevant provision of the obligation act and the public information act summarised in paragraph and below the proceeding before the constitutional court on february the

other legislation in the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that he had suffered a breach of his freedom of expression in particular he maintained i that the printed article in question legitimately raised serious issue to do with the functioning of a staterun public utility company a well a the alleged malfeasance andor corruption on the part of it director and ii that he had ultimately ended up being punished for the article publication by losing a civil defamation case and being ordered to pay compensation plus cost to mr a article of the convention in so far a relevant read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to impart information and idea without interference by public authority the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the government maintained that given that the civil court judgment rendered against the applicant have not been enforced he could no longer claim to be a victim of the violation alleged the applicant disagreed it is the settled caselaw of the court that the word victim in the context of article of the convention denotes the person directly affected by the act or omission at issue the existence of a violation of the convention being conceivable even in the absence of prejudice prejudice is relevant only in the context of article consequently a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status a a victim unless the national authority have acknowledged either expressly or in substance and then afforded redress for the breach of the convention see for example nada v switzerland gc no echr with further reference turning to the present case the court observes that quite apart from the issue of redress the domestic authority have never acknowledged either expressly or in substance the violation of the convention alleged by the applicant accordingly the applicant may still claim to be a victim of a breach of his right under article of the convention and the government objection in this regard must be dismissed the court furthermore note that the application is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any of the other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merit the party submissionsa the applicant the applicant reaffirmed his complaint he furthermore added that the article consisted of a combination of statement of fact and value judgment m b had also carried out proper research before it publication and had enquired with the management of the city cemetery for information concerning the price of a burial plot while pretending to be interested in buying one the management however had been concealing information and avoiding transparency the public had nevertheless learned about several case involving the resale of burial plot where the mortal remains of people who had passed away long ago and whose relative had either died or had left the country had been removed and the plot then resold to the newlyrich who had gained their wealth by doing business in the grey zone or even by engaging in crime the applicant maintained that mr a had been a public official and had therefore had to endure more criticism particularly since the article focused on an important local issue mr a had likewise never disputed that at one time he had in fact been smuggling cigarette which had itself always been an illegal activity while in his s mr a had furthermore obtained his diploma in the shortest possible time and at a private university which had been linked to multiple scandal involving the printing of diploma a for the possibility to refute the allegation contained in the article mr a could have done so but had opted instead in favour of a civil defamation lawsuit lastly the applicant argued that the statement of may to the effect that mr a had apparently wanted to withdraw his enforcement request see paragraph above had had no legal effect a it had been given in the criminal context and not a part of the pending enforcement proceeding it wa furthermore unclear a to whether mr a counsel had even had the authorisation to do so on behalf of his client and the applicable enforcement regulation themselves had not envisaged such a possibility in any event the enforcement request had never been withdrawn in the enforcement proceeding nor had the enforcement judge been informed of what had transpired in the criminal context ultimately the enforcement proceeding had been discontinued only because mr a had not informed the enforcement judge a to how he would have liked to proceed with the case see paragraph above hence mr a could have reinstituted the enforcement proceeding at any point in the meantime however the applicant had been subjected to public humiliation and emotional distress since inter alia enforcement officer had come to his home on several occasion had made an inventory of his property and had even threatened to seize it up until it had become clear that the applicant asset were insufficient to cover the judgment debtb the government the government endorsed the reasoning of the civil court see paragraph and above and maintained that there had been no violation of article in the present case in particular the interference with the applicant freedom of expression had been in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation of others admittedly mr a had been a public figure and the limit of acceptable criticism had thus been broader in his case than with respect to a private individual but even so there had to be some reasonable limit applicable the article had also contained a series of false claim concerning mr a private and professional life which claim had not been properly verified before being published the government reiterated that even where allegation are pure value judgment rather than statement of fact they must still have some factual basis or be deemed a not being in accordance with article of the convention in any event the general tone of the article had been such that it had been clearly intended to belittle mr a and portray him a a dishonest and immoral person prone to breaking the law none of which had been proved in the course of the civil proceeding furthermore even though m b had communicated with the public burial company for research purpose and regarding the lease of a burial plot she had not obtained a statement from mr a personally before the publication of the article and had tried to reach him only once there had in any event been no attempt to conceal any information from m b and the amount of compensation awarded to mr a had not been disproportionate finally the government argued that the applicant had not suffered any adverse consequence since the civil judgment in question had not been enforced in particular on may mr a had withdrawn his enforcement request and had renounced his right to have the enforcement proceeding reinstituted subsequently see paragraph above moreover this declaration had also been accepted by m b representative personally see paragraph and above and on february the kragujevac court of first instance had itself discontinued the enforcement proceeding see paragraph above in any event after december the civil judgment could not have been enforced based on the relevant provision of the obligation act see paragraph above the court assessmenta existence of an interference it is not disputed between the party that the final civil judgment rendered against the applicant a an editorinchief by the kragujevac appeal court on december amounted to an interference by a public authority with his right to freedom of expression see paragraph above see also mutatis mutandis lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc no and and echr iv orban and others v france no january with further reference and gutiérrez suárez v spain no and june a regard the situation of author a well a publisher publication director and editor responsible for their publication it is however understood that the publication of mr a photograph in the impugned article wa not ultimately deemed to amount to a violation of his privacy by the said appellate court which wa why the applicant clearly suffered no interference with his freedom of expression on this account in particular see paragraph above in fine an interference with one freedom of expression will infringe the convention unless it satisfies the requirement of paragraph of article it must therefore be determined whether it wa prescribed by law pursued one or more of the legitimate aim set out in that paragraph and wa necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve those aimsb whether the interference wa prescribed by law the court note that the legal basis for the adoption of the final civil judgement in question wa inter alia the relevant provision of the public information act and the obligation act see paragraph and above the court find that these provision were both adequately accessible and foreseeable that is to say that they were formulated with sufficient precision to enable an individual if need be with appropriate advice to regulate his or her conduct see for example and among many other authority the sunday time v the united kingdom no april series a no and karácsony and others v hungary gc no and may see also in the serbian context tešić v serbia no and february the court therefore concludes that the interference at issue wa prescribed by law within the meaning of article of the conventionc whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim in agreement with the position of the domestic court the government argued that the interference in question had pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation or right of others the court find no reason to hold otherwise and accepts therefore that the interference with the applicant freedom of expression pursued one of the legitimate aim envisaged under article of the conventiond necessary in a democratic societyi general principle the court refers to the general principle for assessing the necessity of an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression a set out in morice v france gc no echr bédat v switzerland gc no march and medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june the court ha also held in numerous case that a lack of relevant and sufficient reasoning on the part of the national court or a failure to consider the applicable standard in assessing the interference in question will entail a violation of article see among many other authority scharsach and news verlagsgesellschaft v austria no echr xi uj v hungary no and july and mariya alekhina and others v russia no july it should furthermore be reiterated that the right to protection of reputation is a right which is guaranteed under article of the convention a part of the right to respect for private life see for instance denisov v ukraine gc no september in order for article to come into play an attack on a person reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be carried out in a manner causing prejudice to the personal enjoyment of one right to respect for his or her private life see axel springer ag v germany gc no february medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above and beizaras and levickas v lithuania no january in instance where in accordance with the criterion set out above the interest of the protection of the reputation or right of others bring article into play the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authority struck a fair balance when protecting the two value guaranteed by the convention namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above the general principle applicable to the balancing of these right were first set out in von hannover v germany no gc no and echr and axel springer ag cited above then restated in more detail in couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no echr extract and more recently summarised in medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above lastly the court ha held that the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity and scope of any interference in the freedom of expression protected by article of the convention where the national authority have weighed up the interest at stake in compliance with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw strong reason are required if it is to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see bédat cited above with further reference the relevant criterion when it come to the balancing exercise between the right protected under article and article of the convention include a the contribution made by the article in question to a debate of public interest b how well known is the person concerned and what is the subject of the report c the conduct of the person concerned prior to the publication of the article d the method of obtaining the information and it veracity e the content form and consequence of the publication and f the severity of the sanction imposed see for example axel springer ag cited above and milisavljević v serbia no april of course some of the above criterion may have more or le relevance given the particular circumstance of a given case see satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june and other relevant criterion may also be taken into account depending on the situation see axel springer se and rtl television gmb h v germany no september ii application of these principle to the present case in assessing the relevant statement contained in the published article and the reason given in the domestic civil judgment to justify the interference with the applicant freedom of expression the court find the following issue of particular relevance having regard to the criterion identified in paragraph and above whether the statement in question made a contribution to a debate of public interest whether mr a can be considered a public figure the content and form of the information contained in the article and lastly the consequence of the publication of the article in respect of mr a and the severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant himselfα whether the article made a contribution to a debate of public interest the public interest ordinarily relates to matter which affect the public to such an extent that it may legitimately take an interest in them which attract it attention or which concern it to a significant degree especially in that they affect the wellbeing of citizen or the life of the community this is also the case with regard to matter which are capable of giving rise to considerable controversy which concern an important social issue or which involve a problem that the public would have an interest in being informed about see among others satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above with this in mind the court considers that the published article in the present case clearly concerned an issue of public interest in so far a it referred to the functioning of a public burial company entrusted with the management of the kragujevac city cemetery the domestic civil court for their part agreed with this by noting that there had been no justified interest for the public to be informed of mr a private life but then going on to carry out an analysis of the allegation to do with the functioning of the public burial company see paragraph and aboveβ whether mr a can be considered a public figure the court reiterates that a distinction ha to be made between private individual and person acting in a public context a political or public figure accordingly whilst a private individual unknown to the public may claim particular protection of his or her right to private life the same is not true of public figure see minelli v switzerland dec no june petrenco v moldova no march and milisavljević cited above in respect of whom the limit of critical comment are wider a they are inevitably and knowingly exposed to public scrutiny and must therefore display a particularly high degree of tolerance see kuliś v poland no march ayhan erdoğan v turkey no january and milisavljević cited above person may in this context be considered a public figure based on inter alia their act andor position through which they have entered the public arena see kapsis and danikas v greece no january with further reference a well a in view of the institutional dimension and importance of their duty see for example chalabi v france no september in their observation both party agreed that mr a had been a public figure within the meaning of article of the convention at the material time see paragraph and above a did the civil court in their judgment rendered earlier see paragraph above in particular given the above caselaw on the issue and the fact that mr a had in fact been responsible for the management and operation of an important public utility company the court find no reason to disagree and concludes that a a public figure mr a had to show in general a greater degree of tolerance than a private individual faced with criticism in a printed publicationγ the content and form of the information contained in the article the court would stress that in the context of freedom of expression it draw a distinction between statement of fact and value judgment the existence of fact can be demonstrated whereas the truth of value judgment is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article however where a statement amount to a value judgment the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement if there is not that value judgment may prove excessive in order to distinguish between a factual allegation and a value judgment it is necessary to take account of the circumstance of the case and the general tone of the remark bearing in mind that assertion about matter of public interest may on that basis constitute value judgment rather than statement of fact see for instance morice cited above with further reference being mindful of the above and a regard the present case the court note that the article see paragraph above read inter alia a follows at a time when thousand of expert and hard worker were losing their job ccu went in another direction and from an ordinary worker three year of vocational school and a street cigarette smuggler became a director of the city cemetery about whose high income both official and more often unofficial under the counter there are fantastical story being told throughout the city leaving nothing to chance ccu managed to secure for himself two diploma just in case they were needed they may come in handy and it sound better when introducing oneself even assuming that the abovequoted statement were exaggerated value judgment rather than statement of fact or even that they amounted to journalistic provocation see for example kuliś cited above with further reference the applicant m b and their publication provided absolutely no evidence in the civil proceeding in support of the contention implicit or otherwise that mr a had in fact obtained any financial gain illegally or had somehow secured his two diploma improperly or unlawfully see paragraph and above mere speculation or at best conjecture in this regard see paragraph above clearly could not suffice a a proper basis for such serious allegation despite the fact that mr a had indeed been a public figure at the material time and that the article itself concerned generally a topic of some public interest it follows therefore that the two paragraph in question were intended to belittle mr a person in breach of the relevant journalistic and ethical standard a suggested by the government in their observation and explained by the civil court in their judgment see paragraph and above also compare and contrast to for example ziembiński v poland no no and july where the publication in question wa deemed satirical and did not involve accusation of criminal wrongdoing by the local government official concerning the remainder of the impugned article the court ha emphasised on many occasion that article of the convention is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such being the demand of that pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society see among other authority handyside v the united kingdom december series a no and observer and guardian v the united kingdom november series a no indeed the role of the press a a public watchdog allows journalist and publisher to have recourse to a certain degree of exaggeration provocation or even harshness see kuliś cited aboveδ the consequence of the publication of the article in respect of mr a a already noted above the right to protection of reputation is a right which is guaranteed under article of the convention a part of the right to respect for private life see paragraph and above given the nature of the allegation concerning mr a published in paragraph and of the impugned article see paragraph above a well a it own conclusion set out in paragraph above the court considers that the consequence of their publication were clearly sufficiently serious so a to attract the protection of article in respect of mr a reputation see paragraph above the domestic civil court were clearly also of this opinion having ruled that mr a had in fact suffered a breach of his honour a well a his reputation see paragraph and aboveε the severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant the nature and severity of the sanction imposed is also a matter of particular importance in assessing the proportionality of the interference under article see paragraph above the amount of any compensation awarded must likewise bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the moral injury suffered by the plaintiff in question see tolstoy miloslavsky v the united kingdom july series a no b see also tešić cited above turning to the present case the court considers that the final civil court judgment rendered against the applicant ordering him together with the other two respondent jointly to pay an rsd equivalent of approximately eur for the mental anguish suffered and the cost incurred plus statutory interest can not a such be deemed severe particularly given the number of the respondent in question and the fact that the amount awarded were never enforced against any of them see paragraph and above also compare and contrast to tešić cited above and ζ conclusion in the light of the above consideration the court is of the opinion particularly given some of the allegation contained in paragraph and of the article that a fair balance ha been struck between the applicant freedom of expression on the one hand and mr a interest in the protection of his reputation on the other it find therefore no need to substitute it view in this regard for those of the domestic court see paragraph above it is further noted that despite the essential role of the press in a democratic society paragraph of article doe not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage involving matter of serious public concern see for example bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii and monnat v switzerland no echr x the protection afforded by article of the convention to journalist a well a to editor by implication is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenet of responsible journalism see for example bédat cited above in view of the foregoing there ha been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimouslydeclares the application admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rule of court hasan bakırcı jon fridrik kjølbro deputy registrar president in the said title this

the chief federal inspector ha brought the medium to it knee but not the businessmen гфи поставил на колени прессу но не коммерсантов the article wa written by the second applicant who signed it using his penname semyon volkov the article concerned a joint press conference held by mr p the chief federal inspector for the kirov region and mr k the mayor of kirov the press conference wa about the medium coverage of the regional project kirov cultural capital of the volga region for the article wa critical of the cultural value of the event connected with the project and spoke ironically about mr p accomplishment in that field mr p wa further quoted a saying that the allotted fund were insufficient to finance the work of the project organising committee and a criticising local business for their unwillingness to sponsor the project allegedly because the project had not received the governor explicit endorsement the article then went on a follows curiously enough just before that meeting i had a chance to talk to some businessmen i know they told me that the chief federal inspector office had literally pestered them with offer for them to become sponsor however they do not respond to such offer not because they fear the governor but because they do not want to give money some say that mr p is too deeply involved in political game of which they want no part others are for some reason concerned that their money might be wasted on the lover of the collector of fund rather than spent on cultural event b defamation proceeding on august mr p in his official capacity a the chief federal inspector brought an action for defamation against the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper and the author of the article semyon volkov according to his statement of claim the final paragraph of the contested article had asserted that he wa in charge of the collection and distribution of fund for the project that he wa capable of committing a crime by embezzling the fund entrusted to him and that he had lover thereby violating moral and ethical norm considering that those statement were untrue and damaging to his honour dignity and professional reputation he sought a retraction and compensation for nonpecuniary damage mr p also enclosed the text of the retraction statement that he wished the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper to publish it contained an apology and an acknowledgement that the last sentence of the paragraph cited above wa untrue and damaging to his honour and reputation a promise to discipline the author of the article and an undertaking to respect the domestic law on the medium in the future on september mr g deputy editorinchief of the first applicant signed a power of attorney appointing mr k and mr r to act a it counsel in the defamation proceeding on september judge s of the leninskiy district court of kirov decided to sever the claim against the author of the article for adjudication in separate proceeding because the first applicant had refused to disclose his identity the proceeding against the author were stayed proceeding in respect of the first applicant on september the leninskiy district court of kirov sitting in a singlejudge formation comprising judge s held a hearing counsel mr k and mr r asked that the hearing be adjourned because the second applicant the newspaper editorinchief and the only person acquainted with the circumstance relating to the contested publication wa on annual leave until october the court refused the request mr k and mr r further submitted that the contested statement did not concern mr p who wa not the collector of fund for the cultural project the fund were being collected by the kirov town administration counsel for mr p submitted that the article had been entirely devoted to mr p it stated in particular that he had pestered local businessmen with request to become sponsor of the cultural project the last sentence of the article which concerned the collector of fund could easily be interpreted a directed at mr p such an interpretation had indeed been made by a number of local newspaper which had also understood the last sentence of the article a referring to mr p on september the leninskiy district court of kirov granted mr p claim against the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper in full the court found that the final paragraph of the article contained false information about the plaintiff who it had falsely alleged wa the collector of fund that might have been wasted on lover rather than spent on cultural event the court noted that the defendant had not produced any proof of the truthfulness of that information it ordered the editorial board to pay the plaintiff russian rouble rur approximately euro eur in compensation for nonpecuniary damage and rur in court fee it further ordered an immediate publication of the retraction statement a drafted by mr p on september enforcement proceeding were opened on the same day the first applicant applied to the leninskiy district court for a stay in the enforcement proceeding it submitted that the court had ordered the enforcement of the judgment against the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper which had no legal entity status and accordingly could not be a defendant in civil proceeding furthermore the order for immediate enforcement wa unlawful and violated the first applicant right to know the reason for the judgment at that time the full text of the judgment wa unavailable and to lodge an appeal against it on september judge s issued two interim decision by the first decision he refused the first applicant request for a stay of enforcement a unsubstantiated no further reason were given the second decision rectified an error in the operative part of the judgment it held that the defendant name wa the limited liability company the editorial board of the vesti newspaper rather than the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper on september the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper published the retraction statement a drafted by mr p and endorsed in the judgment of september on september the first applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment of september submitting that the article had not named the collector of fund for the project or suggested that it wa mr p who had collected the fund nor had it stated that mr p had lover or that he had embezzled any fund entrusted to him it wa clear from the text that the contested sentence did not concern mr p at all the first applicant further complained about the district court unreasoned refusal to adjourn the hearing until the second applicant had returned from leave the second applicant wa the only person who knew the identity of the author of the article and who wa able to give an informed response to the statement of claim the second applicant lodged a statement in support of the appeal he disclosed that he wa the author of the article and stated that the judgment of september had been poorly reasoned although mr p had failed to prove that the contested sentence concerned him personally the district court had accepted his claim without analysing whether the impugned statement were indeed directed at him proceeding in respect of the second applicant on an unspecified date the proceeding against the author of the article were resumed and the second applicant wa summoned to appear before the leninskiy district court a the defendant in mr p defamation case instituted on august his case wa heard by a bench composed of the presiding judge s and two lay assessor the second applicant lodged an objection against judge s on the ground that he had already expressed his position in the judgment against the editorial board lay assessor examined and rejected the objection finding that the second applicant fear a to mr s impartiality were not justified at the hearing on october the second applicant wa represented by mr r a counsel the second applicant and his counsel both argued that the last sentence of the article did not concern mr p it concerned the collector of fund who had not been identified in the article the fact that other newspaper had interpreted the last sentence a directed at mr p wa irrelevant because the second applicant could not be held responsible for the action of other people they further submitted that the second applicant had simply repeated the reservation expressed by businessmen with regard to the distribution of the fund collected for the project counsel for mr p repeated the argument he had advanced at the hearing of september in particular the reason why mr p believed that the contested statement were directed at him he submitted in particular that the title and the structure of the article showed that it wa entirely about mr p and that other people had understood the last sentence of the article a concerning mr p and this had been proved by article in other newspaper on october the leninskiy district court issued a judgment against the second applicant the court found that the article read a a whole gave the impression that the contested statement concerned mr p the same interpretation had been arrived at by other newspaper which had been unanimous in considering that the last sentence had been about mr p the contested statement which accused mr p of spending public fund on lover were damaging to his honour dignity and professional reputation the second applicant had failed to prove the truthfulness of his statement about mr p the second applicant wa ordered to pay rur approximately euro in compensation for nonpecuniary damage and rur in court fee the second applicant appealed he repeated the argument advanced in his statement in support of the first applicant appeal he further argued that the outcome of his case had been predetermined by the judgment against the editorial board judge s who had examined the case against the editorial board wa bound to have had a preconceived opinion on his case appeal proceeding in respect of the applicant on october the kirov regional court adjourned the examination of the appeal it established that the interim decision of september rectifying an error in the judgment of september had been issued in the absence of the interested party moreover the party had not received a copy of that decision and had thereby been deprived of an opportunity to appeal until that omission had been remedied the appeal against the judgment of september could not be examined nor could the appeal against the judgment of october because both case were based on the same claim the determination of one of them would prejudge the outcome of the other on that ground the kirov regional court decided that the two case should be joined and all appeal should be examined simultaneously on november the first applicant lodged an appeal against the interim decision of september it argued that that decision wa unlawful for the following reason the rectification had been made by the district court of it own motion the decision had been taken in the absence of the party and in substance the decision wa the disguised substitution of a defendant rather than a correction of a clerical error or an obvious mistake the first applicant submitted that the limited liability company the editorial board of the vesti newspaper and the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper were two distinct entity the first wa registered a a legal entity while the second wa operating without state registration the fact that the district court had issued a judgment against the wrong entity demonstrated that the adjudication of the case had been superficial and the essential aspect of the case had not been examined properly on november the leninskiy district court by a new interim decision confirmed it earlier decision of september on the rectification of the error regarding the defendant name the first applicant lodged an appeal repeating the argument advanced in the appeal statement of november on december the kirov regional court examined all the appeal both applicant were represented at the hearing by mr r the kirov regional court quashed the interim decision of september on the ground that it had been issued in the absence of the party but upheld the interim decision of november which in it view wa lawful thus it found that counsel who had taken part in the hearing of september had represented the interest of the first applicant the limited liability company the editorial board of the vesti newspaper it wa clear that the judgment of september defined the right of and imposed obligation on the first applicant because no other organisation had been involved in the proceeding the amendment of the defendant name had therefore been no more than a rectification of a clerical error not related to the merit of the case and having no effect on the substance of the judgment the regional court further upheld the judgment of september and october in substance in particular it found that the district court had addressed the applicant argument relating to the existence of an objective link between the contested statement and the plaintiff it had analysed the tile structure and content of the impugned article and had correctly found that it last sentence concerned mr p moreover it had taken into account that mr p wa not the only one to have understood that the sentence had been directed at him other newspaper had also drawn the same conclusion the district court had therefore correctly required the defendant to prove the truthfulness of their allegation which they had failed to do both applicant had been represented at hearing by counsel and their procedural right had therefore been respected finally the regional court held that the severance of the claim against the second applicant from the proceeding had not involved a substantially incorrect determination of the dispute the regional court found however that the district court had incorrectly required the first applicant to publish the retraction statement drafted by the plaintiff the requirement for an apology a promise to discipline the author and an undertaking to respect domestic law contained in the retraction statement had no basis in domestic law the order for immediate enforcement had also been unlawful the court ordered that the first applicant publish an amended retraction statement it also reduced the award payable by the first applicant to rur approximately euro on january the first applicant published the amended retraction statement on august the first applicant wa declared insolvent and dissolved ii relevant domestic lawa civil action for defamation article of the civil code provides that an individual may apply to a court with a request for the retraction of statement svedeniya that are damaging to his or her honour dignity or professional reputation if the person who disseminated such statement doe not prove their truthfulness the aggrieved person may also claim compensation for loss and nonpecuniary damage sustained a a result of the dissemination of such statement ruling no of the plenary supreme court of the russian federation adopted on august a amended on april and in force at the material time provided that in order to be considered damaging statement had to be untrue and contain allegation of a breach of law or moral principle for example the commission of a dishonest act or improper behaviour in the workplace or in everyday life dissemination of statement wa understood a the publication of statement or their broadcasting paragraph the burden of proof wa on the defendant to show that the disseminated statement were true and accurate paragraph on february the plenary supreme court of the russian federation adopted ruling no requiring court hearing defamation claim to distinguish between statement of fact which could be checked for veracity and evaluative judgment opinion and conviction which were not actionable under article of the civil code because they were expression of a defendant subjective opinion and view and therefore could not be checked for veracity paragraph furthermore it prohibited the court from ordering defendant to make an apology to a plaintiff because that form of redress had no basis under russian law including article of the civil code paragraph b defendant in an action for defamation the mass medium act law no i of december defines an editorial board of a news medium a an organisation citizen or group of citizen producing and issuing that news medium an editorial board may start functioning after state registration of the news medium section an editorial

obvious error in calculation in such a case the court had an obligation to hold a hearing and notify the party of it date the party could appeal against the rectification order article the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained of a violation of their right to freedom of expression a provided in article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the applicant submitted that there had been an unlawful interference with their freedom of expression in particular they submitted that the order to publish a retraction statement containing an apology and the order for immediate enforcement had had no basis in domestic law although the appeal court had acknowledged that those order had been unlawful it had not remedied the violation on the contrary the appeal court had aggravated the situation by requiring the first applicant to publish a second retraction statement thus the first applicant had been punished twice the applicant also argued that the first applicant the publisher of the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper could not be cited a a defendant under domestic law an action for defamation had to be brought against the editorial board because the editorial board of the newspaper did not have legal entity status the action had to be brought against it founder the government of the kirov region and the legislative assembly of the kirov region who should have been cited a the defendant see the supreme court ruling of august cited in paragraph above therefore there had been no legal basis for bringing an action for defamation against the publisher the applicant further argued that the interference had been disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued the article had denounced the administrative pressure placed on businessmen with the aim of compelling them to sponsor government project it had also voiced the apprehension of those businessmen that the fund thus collected might be misappropriated it had therefore raised question of public concern moreover the author had simply shared with his reader the opinion held by others without stating that those opinion were true or valid accordingly the interference with the applicant freedom of expression had not corresponded to a pressing social need the government submitted firstly that the interference with the applicant freedom of expression had been lawful the first applicant had been cited a a defendant in the defamation proceeding in accordance with domestic law a to the allegedly unlawful order to publish a retraction statement containing an apology the government submitted that that order had later been quashed on appeal the government conceded that the contested article had raised question of public concern and that the limit of acceptable criticism in respect of mr p a civil servant were wider than in the case of a private individual they submitted however that the article had not been limited to criticism of mr p action in an official capacity it had also encroached on the private sphere claiming that mr p had lover the government disputed the applicant argument that there had been no objective link between those statement and mr p the contested article had been entirely devoted to the activity of the chief federal inspector mr p taking into account the article title structure and content there could be no doubt that the statement concerning the collector of fund had been directed at mr p those statement had been intended a statement of fact and the applicant had failed to prove their truthfulness given that the statement published by the applicant were damaging to mr p honour and reputation the interference with their freedom of expression had been justified the court note that it is common ground between the party that the judgment adopted by the domestic court in the defamation proceeding constituted an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression guaranteed by article it is not contested that the interference pursued a legitimate aim that of protecting the reputation or right of others within the meaning of article the dispute in the case relates to whether the interference wa prescribed by law and whether it wa necessary in a democratic society the court note that article of the civil code provides a legal basis for civil liability for defamation the applicant however argued in accordance with the ruling by the plenary supreme court see paragraph above that an action for defamation had to be brought against the editorial board and that there wa therefore no legal basis for holding the first applicant the publisher of the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper liable the court observes that the applicant assertion that the first applicant and the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper were separate entity is not supported by any evidence the applicant were unable to submit any document showing that the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper existed a a distinct though unregistered legal entity the court note that under domestic law an editorial board must have article of association even if it ha not been registered a a legal entity see paragraph above however the applicant did not submit a copy of the editorial board article of association although they were requested to do so by the court nor did they produce a copy of the compulsory publishing agreement between the editorial board or the editorinchief and the publisher see paragraph above further it is clear from the first applicant article of association that it activity consisted in issuing a well a publishing the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper see paragraph above given that domestic law provides that the issuing of the news medium is the main function of an editorial board see paragraph above the court can not but conclude that the first applicant wa acting both a the newspaper editorial board and it publisher this conclusion find further confirmation in the fact that the newspaper editorial board wa registered at the first applicant official address and that the second applicant occupied the position of both editorinchief of the first applicant and editorinchief of the newspaper finally the court find it significant that the applicant never claimed in the domestic proceeding that there wa no legal basis for the first applicant liability on the ground that it wa the publisher rather than the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper in view of the above the court concludes that the first applicant combined the function of editorial board and publisher of the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper and could be therefore held liable for defamation under domestic law further a regard the applicant argument that the order to publish a retraction statement containing an apology and the order for immediate enforcement had no basis in domestic law the court note that it ha previously found that before the ruling of the plenary supreme court see paragraph above russian court could reasonably interpret article of the civil code a providing for an apology a part of the redress for defamation see kazakov v russia no and december thus in the circumstance of the present case the court is ready to accept that the interpretation of the relevant legislation by the russian court wa not such a to render the impugned interference unlawful in convention term in any event the order to publish a retraction statement containing an apology and the order for immediate enforcement were quashed on appeal see paragraph above the irregularity alleged wa thereby expressly acknowledged and adequately redressed in view of the above the court find that the interference with the applicant freedom of expression wa prescribed by law it remains to be determined whether it wa necessary in a democratic society the test of necessity in a democratic society requires the court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a pressing social need whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason given by the national authority to justify it were relevant and sufficient in assessing whether such a need exists and what measure should be adopted to deal with it the national authority are left a certain margin of appreciation this margin of appreciation is not however unlimited but go hand in hand with a european supervision by the court whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article the court task in exercising it supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authority but rather to review under article in the light of the case a a whole the decision they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation in so doing the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they based their decision on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see among many others grinberg v russia no july stoll v switzerland gc no echr v krasulya v russia no february mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no july and most recently animal defender international v the united kingdom gc no april in the present case the second applicant expressed his view by having them published in a newspaper edited by the first applicant they were found civilly liable for that publication therefore the impugned interference must be seen in the context of the essential role of the press in ensuring the proper functioning of a democratic society see lingens v austria july series a no and sürek v turkey no gc no echr iv it is also significant that the plaintiff mr p the chief federal inspector of the kirov region wa a civil servant although it can not be said that civil servant knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent politician do civil servant acting in an official capacity are like politician subject to wider limit of acceptable criticism than private individual see thoma v luxembourg no echr iii further the allegation of misappropriation of public fund were obviously a matter of great public concern and therefore came within the scope of a public debate on a matter of general importance the court reiterates that there is little scope under article of the convention for restriction on political speech or debate on question of public interest see feldek v slovakia no echr viii and sürek cited above that being said the court reiterates that article of the convention protects journalist right to divulge information on issue of general interest provided that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the ethic of journalism under the term of paragraph of article of the convention freedom of expression carry with it duty and responsibility which also apply to the medium even with respect to matter of serious public concern moreover these duty and responsibility are liable to assume significance when there is a question of attacking the reputation of a named individual and infringing the right of others thus special ground are required before the medium can be dispensed from their ordinary obligation to verify factual statement that are defamatory of private individual whether such ground exist depends in particular on the nature and degree of the defamation in question and the extent to which the medium can reasonably regard their source a reliable with respect to the allegation see lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc no and echr and pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi the court observes that the applicant were found civilly liable for disseminating a statement which they had been unable to prove to the effect that the collector of fund for a regional cultural project might misappropriate the collected fund and spend them on his lover the main dispute between the party related to whether the contested statement concerned the plaintiff the court ha repeatedly stated that for an interference with the right to freedom of expression to be proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation of others the existence of an objective link between the impugned statement and the person suing for defamation is a requisite element mere personal conjecture or a subjective perception of a statement a defamatory doe not suffice to establish that the person wa directly affected by it there must be something in the circumstance of a particular case to make the ordinary reader feel that the statement reflected directly on the individual claimant or that he wa targeted by the criticism see filatenko v russia no december and dyuldin and kislov v russia no july the court note that the question whether there wa an objective link between the impugned statement and the plaintiff mr p wa extensively debated in the domestic proceeding after hearing the party analysing the title structure and content of the impugned article and studying how it wa understood by other newspaper the court found that the statement wa directed at mr p see paragraph and above the court doe not see any reason to depart from that finding it is true that the collector of fund wa not mentioned by name and that mr p did not officially perform that function a the fund were formally collected by the local administration however when read in context in particular in conjunction with the article title and such statement a the chief federal inspector office literally pestered them with offer to become sponsor the contested statement might convey to an ordinary reader the impression that it wa the chief federal inspector mr p who wa the collector of fund referred to in the contested statement indeed that wa the interpretation made by a number of the local newspaper which also understood that the contested statement wa directed at mr p the court therefore accepts the finding of the domestic court that the applicant had disseminated a statement that the plaintiff mr p might spend public fund on his lover the court considers it regrettable that the domestic court did not express any opinion a to whether the above statement constituted a factual allegation or a value judgment before holding the applicant liable for their failure to prove it veracity the court find it difficult to determine whether that statement wa a statement of fact or a value judgment the use of the modal verb might suggests that it wa a supposition rather than a statement of fact indeed from a grammatical point of view modality deal with uncertainty and attitude rather than certainty and fact however it is not necessary to determine this issue because under the court caselaw even a value judgment must be based on sufficient fact in order to constitute a fair comment under article see jerusalem v austria no echr ii the court note that the applicant never endeavoured to establish a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis for their allegation that mr p had lover and might spend public fund on them although the second applicant claimed that he had obtained that information from some unnamed businessmen he knew see paragraph above he never attempted to verify the rumour the court reiterates in this connection that even public figure may legitimately expect to be protected against the propagation of unfounded rumour relating to their private life see standard verlags gmb h v austria no no june given that the applicant were unable to adduce sufficient evidence in support of their allegation the court considers that they disseminated unverified information about mr p alleged involvement in extramarital affair and a gratuitous accusation of misappropriation of public fund the court see no reason to disagree with the domestic court assessment that the contested statement wa of such a nature and gravity a to be capable of causing considerable harm to the reputation of mr p it therefore find the statement about mr p private life and his alleged mismanagement of public fund frivolous and unfounded the applicant must be therefore taken to have gone beyond the limit of responsible journalism set out in paragraph above finally in assessing the proportionality of an interference the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are also factor to be taken into account see skałka v poland no may in this connection the court note that the amount of damage the applicant were ordered to pay to the plaintiff doe not appear excessive in the light of these consideration it can not be said that the decision of the domestic court overstepped the margin of appreciation afforded to them thus the court accepts that the interference complained of wa not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and can therefore be considered necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention accordingly there ha been no violation of article of the convention ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that the court that examined the defamation claim against them had been biased and that the principle of adversarial proceeding and equality of arm had been breached the relevant part of article read a follows in the determination of his civil right and obligation everyone is entitled to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal a impartiality of the court the applicant submitted that judge s the only professional judge in the formation examining the claim against the second applicant had been biased firstly he had adjudicated the claim against the first applicant and had already stated his position on the merit of the case in the applicant opinion in order to maintain the appearance that his position wa consistent judge s had to arrive at the same conclusion in respect of the claim against the second applicant secondly by resuming of his own motion the case against the second applicant judge s had acted in the interest of the plaintiff thereby demonstrating his prejudice against the applicant the government argued that the claim against the author had been correctly and lawfully severed from the claim against the editorial board the editorial board had refused to reveal the identity of the author of the impugned article and the court had had no other choice but to sever the claim after the name of the author had been revealed and the proceeding against him had resumed there had been no procedural obstacle to prevent judge s who had adjudicated the claim against the editorial board from examining the claim against the author under domestic law there were no ground for objecting to judge s the court reiterates that impartiality normally denotes the absence of prejudice or bias and it existence or otherwise can be tested in various way the court ha thus distinguished between a subjective approach that is endeavouring to ascertain the personal conviction or interest of a given judge in a particular case and an objective approach that is determining whether he or she offered sufficient guarantee to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect see among many other authority gautrin and others v france may report of judgment and decision iii and kyprianou v cyprus gc no echr xiii a to the subjective test the personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary see padovani v italy february series a no b in the instant case the judge subjective impartiality wa not disputed by the party a to the objective test when applied to a single judge or a body sitting a a bench it mean determining whether quite apart from the personal conduct of the judge or of any of the member of the judicial bench there are ascertainable fact which may raise doubt a to the judge or the bench impartiality in this regard even appearance may be of some importance what is at stake is the confidence which the court in a democratic society must inspire in the public it follows that when it is being decided whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or judicial bench lack impartiality the standpoint of those claiming that the judge or the bench is not impartial is important but not decisive what is decisive is whether the fear can be held to be objectively justified see gautrin and others and kyprianou both cited above and respectively in the present case the fear of bias stemmed principally from the fact that judge s one of the three judge on the bench examining the claim against the second applicant had already stated his position that the contested statement were defamatory in the case against the first applicant the court accepts that that situation could raise doubt about the impartiality of judge s in the applicant mind it ha thus to decide whether those doubt were objectively justified the court ha found in a number of case that the involvement of the same judge in two set of the proceeding concerning the same event may under certain circumstance cast doubt on that judge impartiality see for example ferrantelli and santangelo v italy august report iii and rojas morale v italy no november where a violation of article wa found because a judge sitting in a criminal case had earlier tried a coaccused and by contrast schwarzenberger v germany no et seq august martelli v italy dec no april and poppe v the netherlands no et seq march where no violation of article wa found in similar circumstance see also fatullayev v azerbaijan no april where the same judge examined question of both civil liability and criminal liability arising from the same fact at the same time the court reiterates that the mere fact that the same judge adjudicated two set of proceeding arising out of the same event is not in itself sufficient to undermine that judge impartiality and that the answer to the question whether an applicant fear are objectively justified depends on the circumstance and the special feature of each particular case see schwarzenberger cited above poppe cited above see also delage and magistrello v france dec no january lindon otchakovsky laurens and july cited above and cañas gómez v spain dec no september all concerning involvement of the same judge in two civil case arising out of the same event turning to the circumstance of the present case the court note that the plaintiff mr p submitted claim simultaneously against the editorial board of the newspaper and the author of the contested article whose identity wa unknown the case wa attributed to judge s given that the first applicant the editorial board of the newspaper refused to disclose the identity of the author judge s severed the claim against the author for adjudication in separate proceeding and stayed those proceeding after the pronouncement by judge s on september of the judgment against the first applicant and while the appeal against that judgment wa pending the second applicant disclosed that he wa the author of the article immediately after that judge s resumed the proceeding against the author on october judge s presiding over a bench of two lay assessor issued the judgment against the second applicant the two set of proceeding were then joined and examined simultaneously by the appeal court in order to determine whether the involvement of judge s in the proceeding against the second applicant after he had participated in the proceeding against the first applicant cast objectively justified doubt on his impartiality the court must take into account the following circumstance the nature and extent of judge s function during both set of proceeding whether the text of the judgment against the first applicant contained any statement concerning the second applicant and created the impression that judge s considered the second applicant liable for defamation and whether in the course of the proceeding against the second applicant judge s gave fresh consideration to the case taking into account the new evidence submitted by the second applicant see ferrantelli and santangelo cited above rojas morale cited above delage and magistrello cited above schwarzenberger cited above and martelli cited above lindon otchakovsky laurens and july cited above poppe cited above and and cañas gómez cited above the court note that in the judgment of september judge s found on the basis of the evidence available to him at that time that the first applicant wa liable for defamation because it had failed to prove the truthfulness of the allegation published by it he did not make any finding a to the liability of the author of the article nor did he use any expression which might create the impression that he had formed any opinion a to the liability of the author see paragraph above further the court observes that when examining the claim against the second applicant judge s wa in no way bound by his first decision which wa not yet final indeed the judgment of october against the second applicant did not contain any reference to the judgment of september judge s gave fresh consideration to the entire case in adversarial proceeding with the benefit of the more comprehensive information obtainable from the second applicant the author of the contested article the second applicant wa free to advance new legal argument or submit evidence showing that the impugned statement authored by him had had a sufficient factual basis or wa otherwise justified a can be seen from the text of the judgment of october the judge took such new argument and evidence into account when deciding whether the second applicant wa liable for defamation see paragraph above in view of the above the court doe not see any reason to suspect that judge s a professional judge who possessed the necessary experience and training to allow him to judge a particular dispute fairly on the basis of it own circumstance see mutatis mutandis craxi v italy no no december wa prejudiced against the second applicant because of his previous involvement in the proceeding against the first applicant a judge s never made any statement implying that he had formed an unfavourable opinion of the second applicant case before presiding over the court that had to decide it the presumption of impartiality can not be said to have been rebutted finally it is relevant that when examining the claim against the second applicant judge s wa not sitting in a singlejudge formation but wa assisted by two lay assessor whose impartiality the applicant did not question see mutadis mutandis diennet v france september series a no a consequently any doubt the applicant may have had a regard the impartiality of judge s can not be held to be objectively justified there ha therefore been no violation of article of the convention a regard the impartiality of the court b equality of arm the applicant further submitted that the judgment of september had been given against the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper however on september six day after the pronouncement of the judgment the first applicant had been made a defendant by an interim decision issued in it absence the substitution of a defendant disguised a the rectification of a clerical error had resulted in a violation of the applicant procedural right the applicant had been absent from the hearing of september and had been given no opportunity to present their case or submit evidence to the district court counsel who had attended the hearing of september had represented the interest of the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper that the first applicant had subsequently retained the same counsel to represent it before the appeal court could not remedy the disadvantage created on september the fact remained that at the crucial firstinstance hearing the applicant had been absent and unrepresented and had been deprived of an opportunity to defend their position and comment on the plaintiff claim the government submitted that the first applicant representative had participated in the defamation proceeding from the beginning and had been present at the hearing of september in support of their submission they produced a power of attorney signed by a deputy editorinchief of the first applicant on september appointing mr k and mr r to act a the first applicant counsel in the defamation proceeding see paragraph above they also produced material from the case file showing that all written pleading had been submitted on behalf of the first applicant rather than on behalf of the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper they also referred to the decision of december by the regional court which found that the judgment of september had defined the right of and imposed obligation on the first applicant because no other organisation had been involved in the proceeding the naming of the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper a the defendant had been no more than a clerical mistake the court reiterates that it is central to the concept of a fair trial in civil a in criminal proceeding that a litigant is not denied the opportunity to present his or her case effectively before the court and that he or she is able to enjoy equality of arm with the opposing side see steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii the principle of adversarial proceeding and equality of arm requires that each party be given a reasonable opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observation made or evidence adduced by the other party and to present it case under condition that do not place it at a substantial disadvantage visàvis it opponent see krčmář and others v the czech republic no march and dombo beheer bv v the netherlands october series a no article leaf to the state a free choice of the mean to be used in guaranteeing litigant these right see steel and morris cited above thus given that article of the convention doe not guarantee a right to personal presence before a civil court representation may be an appropriate solution in case where a party can not appear in person see gryaznov v russia no june turning to the citcumstances of the present case the court note that the applicant assertion that the first applicant wa neither present nor represented at the hearing of september is refuted by the document in the case file it is clear from the material in the court possession that from september that is from the very beginning of the defamation proceeding the first applicant wa represented by counsel mr k and mr r see paragraph above they submitted written pleading on the first applicant behalf and participated in all hearing including the hearing of september and the appeal hearing where they made submission on behalf of the first applicant the applicant allegation that mr k and mr r acted on behalf of the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper doe not therefore find confirmation in the case file moreover the court ha already found that the first applicant and the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper were one and the same entity see paragraph to above it is therefore not persuaded by the applicant argument that the interim decision of september wa the substitution of a defendant in disguise it is convinced by the domestic court finding that the judgment of september defined the right of and imposed obligation on the first applicant because no other organisation had been involved in the proceeding see paragraph above the amendment of the defendant name wa therefore no more than a rectification of a clerical error correcting a misspelling of the name of the first applicant which acted a the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper and which had effectively participated a a defendant in the defamation proceeding from their beginning the court concludes that the first applicant representative participated throughout the defamation proceeding and the first applicant wa therefore given an effective opportunity to present it case by commenting on the plaintiff claim making submission and adducing evidence a regard the second applicant absence from the hearing of september it is significant that he wa informed in advance about that hearing he wa therefore given a reasonable opportunity to arrange either for his personal presence or for representation by counsel however he failed to act with reasonable diligence and take the necessary step to ensure that his case wa effectively presented before the court see for similar reasoning milovanova v ukrain dec no october and belan v russia dec no september it is also relevant that the second applicant wa personally present and represented by counsel at the hearing of october and at all appeal hearing in view of the above the court find that the applicant were given a reasonable opportunity to present their case effectively before the court and were able to enjoy equality of arm with the opposing side there ha been therefore no violation of article of the convention a regard the principle of adversarial proceeding and equality of arm for these reason the court unanimously hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention a regard the alleged partiality of the court hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention a regard the principle of adversarial proceeding and equality of arm done in english and notified in writing on may pursuant to rule and of the rule of court

12,background to the case the applicant wa born in and life in weinheim he is a campaigner against abortion and operates an antiabortion website on which he campaign occasionally in a very graphic way against abortion by a decision of march the federal review board for publication harmful to minor bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende schriften included the applicant website wwwbabycaustde the german website on the list of publication considered to be harmful to minor the applicant subsequently redesigned his online presence his new website included a link in bold type to the website wwwbabycaustat the austrian website which wa operated by mh since deceased described by the applicant on his current website a a dear friend and fellow campaigner attached to the link to the austrian website wa the following comment if you want to know more about the modernday democratic crime of abortion make your enquiry in austria wenn sie mehr über da modern demokratische verbrechen der abtreibung wissen wollen dann fragen sie in österreich nach at the material time the content of the austrian website wa essentially consistent with that of the german website prior to the objection from the federal review board in addition the austrian website contained a link to a version of the applicant complete german website a it had originally existed prior to the federal review board objection only the website credit had been deleted the applicant had provided mh with a cd containing all the data required for the running of the austrian website the version of the german website which could be reached via the link on the austrian website included the following statement equating the babycaust to the holocaust would mean relativising today abortion murder den babycaust mit dem holocaust gleichzusetzen würde bedeuten die heutigen abtreibungsmorde zu relativieren moreover on the home page of the austrian website the following statement wa shown between two photo of baby one of which wa obviously covered in blood there is no other word for it abortion is aggravated murder abtreibung ist mord e gibt kein anderes wortthe photo underneath showed a pile of corps in an

of their mother pervertierte ärzte ermordeten im auftrag der mütter die ungeborenen kinder from that page the reader wa directed to a locationbased alphabetical list mentioning the name and practice address of many doctor across germany who performed abortion the list wa accompanied by an invitation to pray for these doctor dr f the plaintiff in the main proceeding wa mentioned on the list he wa of jewish faith and his family had suffered from the atrocity carried out during the national socialist era b domestic proceeding dr f applied to the court for an injunction against the applicant and mh a well a for damage for the violation of his personality right he argued that the website in question had generated a direct association between the named doctor and the third reich equated abortion with the crime of the third reich and stigmatised him a a murderer on february the karlsruhe regional court ordered the applicant to desist from using andor allowing the use of the term aggravated murder on the german website or the austrian website to describe abortion performed by dr f who wa named on those website it also ordered the applicant a joint and several debtor gesamtschuldner with mh to pay dr f compensation of euro eur a similar order against mh wa issued in a separate judgment the karlsruhe regional court gave the following ground for it decision firstly it established that the statement at issue could be attributed to the applicant the fact that the said content wa accessible only via the indirect route of the austrian website operated by mh wa irrelevant the applicant had made the content his own by having referred and created a link on the german website expressly to mhs website he had also not disputed during the proceeding that the statement had originated from him moreover throughout the proceeding he had continuously and with conviction described abortion a aggravated murder and considered the comparison of abortion and the holocaust reflected even in the babycaust domain name to be appropriate in a next step the court analysed screenshots of the website which had been submitted by the plaintiff it concluded that the website at issue contained the general statement that abortion a performed by dr f were act of aggravated murder comparable with the utterly unjustifiable atrocity inflicted on jew in the third reich by mentioning dr f name and his practice address directly in this context the applicant had reproached the doctor specifically for performing abortion and had created a pillory effect even though the applicant had made his statement in the context of a public debate of fundamental importance and freedom of expression protected polemical and sharp criticism the applicant comment on the german website and the austrian website had not been posted a broad criticism but specifically against the doctor mentioned on those site the applicant had purposefully undermined the plaintiff right of personality by labelling abortion a aggravated murder equating it to the crime of the holocaust and reproaching dr f specifically for his involvement this wa also true on the assumption that the statement constituted an expression of opinion and not a factual claim consequently the weighing of all those consideration turned out in favour of dr f general right of personality which in these circumstance prevailed over the applicant freedom of expression a regard damage the karlsruhe regional court reasoned that the violation of the right of personality and the associated stigmatising effect were particularly serious given that dr f himself wa jewish and his family had suffered directly the nazi atrocity in the third reich moreover the court took into account that the applicant had persistently made these or similar statement and had not been dissuaded by order to desist issued against him such a the decision of the karlsruhe court of appeal of february u to which the website referred see paragraph above or the inclusion of the website on the list of publication harmful to minor by the federal review board by indicative order of september the karlsruhe court of appeal notified the applicant of it intention to dismiss his appeal owing to insufficient prospect of success the court elaborated that the regional court conclusion that the austrian website had levelled the serious and personal allegation against dr f that he had performed act of aggravated murder the allegation had further involved comparing abortion to the extermination of jew under nazi rule this had constituted a serious attack on dr f reputation and personality right the court of appeal also confirmed that the applicant had to assume responsibility for the content of the austrian website he had given the relevant content from his own website over to mh and had given his consent by mean of a link for it to be posted on the austrian website moreover the award of monetary compensation wa appropriate in the light of the severity of the interference with the general right of personality the regional court had correctly taken into account to the detriment of the applicant that he had failed to observe the legally binding decision of the karlsruhe court of appeal of february the court further clarified that for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation to be awarded it wa irrelevant whether dr f wa jewish and that his family had been persecuted under the nazi regime in support of that view the court adjudged that there were no apparent indication that the applicant had had or should have had any such knowledge the applicant wa provided with the opportunity to submit his position on the above reasoning which he made use of to no avail on february the karlsruhe court of appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant without an oral hearing it referred to it reasoning in the indicative order of september and emphasised that the awarded damage had been justified irrespective of whether dr f wa jewish on april the federal constitutional court refused to admit a complaint by the applicant for adjudication for being inadmissible bv r without providing reason ii relevant domestic law and practice the relevant domestic law and practice have been set out in the court judgment in annen no no september the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the civil injunction and the order to pay damage had violated his freedom of expression a provided in article of the convention which read in so far a relevant a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others a admissibility the court note that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission the applicant submitted that his statement had contributed to a public debate of great importance and had not been aimed at equating the inhuman killing by nazi doctor to the medical activity performed by dr f however mentioning the holocaust had been aimed at having a warning effect the applicant further argued that dr f faith had had no bearing on the criticism of his conduct which he had also made in regard to doctor of other faith moreover the applicant put forward the argument that abortion could be considered aggravated murder a maliciousness wa defined a the exploitation of the victim helplessness and lack of suspicion in sum he claimed that there had been no pressing social need for the injunction and the order to pay damage and given his contribution to a public debate dr f personality right should not have been considered more important than his freedom of expression the government accepted that the judgment of the domestic court had constituted an interference with the applicant freedom of expression nonetheless they submitted that this interference had been based on article of the civil code pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the right and reputation of dr f and had been ultimately justified the court had assessed the content of the website with the help of screenshots in detail and had considered possible interpretation however they had come to the conclusion that based on a realistic interpretation the website had contained the general statement that the abortion performed by dr f had constituted act of aggravated murder comparable with the mass murder of jew under the nazi regime a dr f had been listed by name and address on the website he had been indirectly labelled a perverted doctor and murderer of unborn child with a character comparable to a concentration camp commander having regard to these serious allegation the balancing exercise between the applicant freedom of expression and dr f personality right had had to fall in favour of dr f right moreover the accusation had been of such a serious nature that they not only justified a civil injunction but had also an order to pay damage the government also argued that the present case differed strongly from the case of annen v germany no november on a factual level in the present case the applicant had made no reference to the actual legal situation regarding the criminal liability of abortion or to the fact that law and moral could differ from each other moreover the statement comparing abortion to the holocaust were not limited to the domain name babycaust of the website but inter alia to explicitly equating doctor performing abortion to concentration camp commander the thirdparties submission the thirdparty intervener adf international submitted that according to the court caselaw freedom of expression played an essential role in a democratic society and that even idea that offend shock or disturb were protected under article particular protection wa granted to expression of opinion which were made in the course of a debate on matter of public interest and the court itself had recognised that the question of abortion raised moral and ethical issue of public interest furthermore the court had also recognised the special importance of advocacy group in democratic society and for public discussion in sum adf international argued that restriction on speech in this area could only be justified in the most extraordinary circumstance the thirdparty intervener ordo iuris institute referred to the court wellestablished caselaw according to which even idea that offend shock or disturb were protected by freedom of expression it further argued that this caselaw had been followed by polish court which had accepted comparison between abortion and genocide in the context of antiabortion campaign dr f submitted that the right to freedom of expression wa subject to the limitation outlined in of article of the convention therefore freedom of expression could be restricted if it wa necessary for the protection of the right of others in particular when statement went beyond being polemical or exaggerated critique and solely pilloried someone these statement no longer served a debate of public interest but constituted vilification this held particularly true when doctor were accused of aggravated murder and their medical activity were compared with the unjustifiable annihilation of jew in the third reich the third party intervener further argued that the present case had to be clearly distinguished from annen v germany no november since the statement currently at issue clearly compared abortion with the holocaust and it wa not possible to understand them a merely generating awareness that law and moral could differ from each other the court assessment at the outset the court considers and this is not in dispute between the party that the injunction and the order to pay damage interfered with the applicant right to freedom of expression that the interference were prescribed by law namely article and of the civil code and that they pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the right of others it therefore remains to be determined whether the interference were necessary in a democratic society the fundamental principle concerning the question of whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the court caselaw and have recently been summarised a follows see delfi a v estonia gc no june with further referencesi freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society a set forth in article this freedom is subject to exception which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article iii the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact the court further reiterates that the right to protection of reputation is protected by article of the convention a part of the right to respect for private life see chauvy and others v france no echr vi pfeifer v austria no november and polanco torres and movilla polanco v spain no september in order for article to come into play however an attack on a person reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be made in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see a v norway no april axel springer ag v germany gc no february and delfi a cited above in case that concerned allegation of criminal conduct the court also took into account that under article of the convention individual have a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty see among other authority worm v austria august report of judgment and decision v and du roy and malaurie v france no echr x when examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interest of the protection of the reputation or right of others the court may be required to ascertain whether the domestic authority have struck a fair balance when protecting two value guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain case namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see hachette filipacchi associés v france no june mgn limited v the united kingdom no january axel springer ag cited above and delfi a cited above turning to the circumstance of the present case the court observes that the regional court classified the statement not a statement of fact but a expression of opinion the court will therefore proceed on the assumption that the statement are to be considered value judgment and would reiterate in that regard that while the existence of fact can be demonstrated the truth of value judgment is not susceptible of proof however even where a statement amount to a value judgment there must be a sufficient factual basis to support it failing which it will be excessive see jerusalem v austria no echr ii the court note that the domestic court concluded that the website contained the general statement that abortion a performed by dr f were act of aggravated murder given the applicant statement such a there is no other word for it abortion is aggravated murder and we will stand firm in our conviction that the wilful bringingtodeath of an innocent human being is aggravated murder the court agrees with that conclusion the court also take note of the fact that the applicant argued before the court that abortion could be considered aggravated murder within the meaning of article of the criminal code however it also observes that article of the criminal code clearly outline the criminal liability of abortion that are not exempted from criminal liability under article a of the criminal code and that there is no domestic caselaw or other evidence in domestic law supporting the applicant claim in sum the court find that there wa not a sufficient factual basis for calling abortion a performed by dr f aggravated murder in that regard the court also note that these accusation were not only very serious something reflected in the fact that a conviction for aggravated murder would carry a life sentence but might also incite to hatred and aggression the court further observes that the domestic court additionally justified the injunction and the order to pay damage by the applicant comparison of abortion with the holocaust and the atrocity under the nazi regime the court would reiterate that the impact an expression of opinion ha on another person personality right can not be detached from the historical and social context in which the statement wa made and that reference to the holocaust must be seen in the specific context of german history see annen cited above hoffer and annen v germany dec no january in the annen case the court concluded that the holocaust reference in the leaflet at issue alone could not justify a civil injunction since the applicant had not explicitly equated abortion with the holocaust and his reference to the killing of human being in auschwitz could be understood a a way of creating awareness of the general fact that law may diverge from morality however the court note that the applicant statement in the present case exceeded the one examined in the context of the case of annen and that the applicant equated doctor who performed abortion with concentration camp commander and even stated that equating the babycaust with the holocaust would mean relativising today abortion murder in view of these statement the court agrees with the finding of the domestic court that the applicant had equated the medical activity of dr f to the utterly unjustifiable atrocity inflicted on jew under the nazi regime in sum the court considers that the applicant statement had no sufficient factual foundation and severely violated dr f reputation consequently the reason adduced by the domestic court were not only relevant but also sufficient to justify the interference with the applicant freedom of expression lastly the court observes that the applicant wa not criminally convicted for slander a regard the civil injunction the court take note of the fact that the applicant wa not prevented from campaigning against abortion in general but only prohibited from describing abortion a performed by dr f a aggravated murder in so far a damage are concerned the court observed that the domestic court elaborated in detail why the violation of dr f personality right had been particularly serious and why they considered damage appropriate in the present case while the court accepts that this interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression wa more intense than in case where he wa only ordered to desist from making a specific statement it considers that based on the national court reasoning the amount awarded to dr f did not fall outside their margin of appreciation in these circumstance the court concludes that the injunction and the order to pay damage were not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and that the reason given by the domestic court were relevant and sufficient the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression could therefore reasonably be regarded by the domestic court a necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation and right of dr f there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the complaint concerning article of the convention admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rule of court claudia westerdiek yonko grozev registrar president,,,
13,in and life in genappe he wa represented by mr a berenboom lawyer the belgian government the government were represented by their agent m i niedlispacher of the federal justice department background to the case the applicant is the publisher of the newspaper le soir one of belgium leading frenchlanguage newspaper in a print edition of the newspaper an article reported among other item on a car accident caused by g that had led to the death of two people and injured three others the article mentioned g full name g wa convicted in connection with the incident in he served his sentence and wa formally rehabilitated in since june the newspaper website ha provided an electronic version of it archive dating back to including the abovementioned article when the archive were published online and throughout the proceeding before the domestic court the article were freely accessible on the website on june july and august g wrote to the legal department of the public limited company rossel et compagnie which owned le soir requesting that the article be removed from the newspaper electronic archive or at least rendered anonymous in support of his request g referred to the fact that he wa a doctor and that the article appeared on the list of search result when his name wa typed into several search engine on january the legal department of rossel et compagnie refused to remove the impugned article from the archive but stated that it had given notice to the administrator of the search engine google to delist the article a reminder wa sent to the administrator of google on february before the domestic court the applicant stated that these step had produced no response the court ha not been informed of any subsequent followup action on march g brought the case before the council for journalistic ethic conseil de déontologie journalistique the cdj the selfregulatory body of the french and germanspeaking medium in belgium on april the cdj declared the request inadmissible on the ground that the dispute did not concern a matter of journalistic ethic it pointed to the solution that had been adopted by belgian newspaper publisher with regard to electronic press archive namely the right to rectification in case where the information wa inaccurate and the right of electronic communication in case where the information wa incomplete domestic court proceeding in a summons served on may g instituted proceeding against the applicant in the neufchâteau court of first instance seeking to have the online press archive in question anonymised on the basis of article of the civil code in the alternative should the applicant actually provide irrefutable technical evidence of the impossibility of making the information anonymous g sought an order requiring him to add a noindex tag to the online version of the article to prevent it from appearing on the list of result when his name wa typed into the search engine of the newspaper website in g view by keeping the article online without anonymising it or adding a noindex tag despite receiving a reasonable and substantiated request to that effect the applicant had committed a fault and had infringed g right to be forgotten in a judgment of january the court of first instance allowed most of g claim noting that the applicant had not adduced any evidence of the impossibility of anonymising the article the court ordered him to replace g first name and surname by the letter x in the digital version of the article featured on the newspaper website and on any other database for which he wa responsible the applicant wa ordered to pay one euro to g in respect of nonpecuniary damage and to pay g cost the court rejected the request for an anonymised version of the judgment to be sent to the party and to possible third party and for the judgment to be declared immediately enforceable in a judgment of september the liège court of appeal upheld the lower court judgment in it entirety the court of appeal began by pointing out that each of the party had fundamental right that were not absolute and were of equal ranking a to the criterion of lawfulness required in order to derogate from the principle of freedom of expression the court of appeal noted that the right to be forgotten wa considered an integral part of the right to respect for private life a enshrined in article of the convention article of the international covenant on civil and political right and article of the constitution that wa sufficient to satisfy the lawfulness test in order to derogate from the principle of freedom of expression the court dismissed the applicant argument that article of the civil code did not provide a clear and foreseeable legal basis the provision in question constituted the ordinary rule on liability and wa applicable to news organisation which could not be unaware that they might be held liable if the exercise of press freedom caused damage resulting from an infringement of the right of others a the court of first instance had observed article et seq of the civil code a interpreted by the belgian legal literature and caselaw constituted legislation that wa sufficiently accessible clear precise and foreseeable for the purpose of article of the convention the court of appeal added that alongside the traditional aspect of the right to be forgotten linked to the fresh disclosure by the press of a person previous conviction there existed a second aspect linked to the erasure of the digital data and in particular the data available on the internet the dispute which concerned the digitisation of journalistic archive related to the latter aspect namely the right to be forgotten online what wa sought therefore wa the removal of information available on the internet this right to be forgotten online had recently been established by the court of justice of the european union the cjeu in it judgment in google spain and google c may see paragraph below the cjeu had held that the requirement regarding fresh disclosure of the information could be inferred from the effect of the search tool which gave prominence to information that would not otherwise be visible online it wa true that the cjeu judgment concerned a dispute between a private individual and the operator of a search engine nevertheless the principle established by that judgment could be transposed to the case at hand in so far a the publisher had also enabled the article in question to be given prominence via the search engine of the newspaper website which wa accessible free of charge the effect had also been multiplied significantly by the development of the operating software used by googletype search engine the indexing of the article on search engine wa only possible because it wa present in the database of le soir in nonanonymised form and without any noindex tag the right to be forgotten online wa not unlimited and had to be regulated in so far a it wa liable to come into conflict with the freedom of expression of the press in order to ass whether a balance had been struck between the fundamental right enshrined inter alia in article and of the convention it wa necessary to have regard to the criterion defined in the court caselaw von hannover v germany no gc no and echr and the caselaw of the cjeu google spain and google cited above thus in order for a right to be forgotten to be recognised the fact had to have been disclosed lawfully in the first place and had to be of a judicial nature there could be no current interest in their disclosure the fact could not be of historical interest a certain time had to have elapsed between the two disclosure and the person concerned could not be a public figure had to have an interest in being reintegrated into society and had to have discharged his or her debt the court of appeal task in the case before it wa to ascertain whether in the light of these criterion the restriction on press freedom stemming from g request pursued a legitimate aim and satisfied the proportionality test in conformity with article of the convention in the instant case the court of appeal found that it wa not disputed that the original disclosure of the information in question had been lawful and that the fact reported on had been of a judicial nature the fresh disclosure of the fact had no value in term of newsworthiness g did not hold any public office the mere fact that he wa a doctor in no way justified his continued identification in the online article some twenty year after the event the court considered this to be illegitimate and disproportionate since it did not add anything to the value of the article and wa liable to cause indefinite and serious harm to g reputation by giving him a virtual criminal record despite the fact that he had not only served his sentence after a final conviction for the offence but had also been rehabilitated twenty year after the event the identity of a person who wa not a public figure did not enhance the public interest of the article which merely contributed at a statistical level to a public debate on road safety in the court of appeal view removing g first name and surname did not render the information devoid of interest since it would have no impact on the actual substance of the information conveyed which concerned a tragic road traffic accident caused in particular by the harmful effect of alcohol the applicant argument concerning the duty of remembrance and the need to preserve a full and faithful record in the archive were irrelevant g had not requested that the impugned article be removed from the archive but simply that the electronic version be rendered anonymous the paper archive remained intact and the applicant wa still able to ensure the integrity of the original digital version the event reported on in the article were clearly not of historical significance a the article related to a banal albeit tragic news story which wa not alleged still le demonstrated to have been a source of particular public concern lastly a significant length of time sixteen year had elapsed between the initial publication of the article and the first request for anonymisation some twenty year had passed by the time of delivery of the judgment it followed from all these consideration that g satisfied the criterion for claiming a right to be forgotten and that keeping the article in question online without rendering it anonymous wa liable to cause him disproportionate harm when weighed against the benefit of strict observance of the applicant right to freedom of expression the criterion of lawfulness legitimacy and proportionality arising out of article of the convention were satisfied in the court of appeal view the request for anonymisation had been apt to ensure a proper balance between the interest at stake that balance would not be achieved by the establishment of a right to digital rectification or communication a proposed by the applicant such procedure would not be appropriate a they would allow the stigmatising effect of the serious offence committed by g and of the sentence he had already served to persist indefinitely and would render the rehabilitation order given in his favour meaningless hence the most effective mean of protecting g privacy without interfering to a disproportionate extent with the applicant freedom of expression wa to anonymise the article on the website of le soir by replacing g first name and surname with the letter x in the court of appeal view by refusing to accede to the request to anonymise the article the applicant had not acted in the way that any prudent and diligent publisher would act in the same circumstance that refusal constituted a fault a simple search using g first name and surname in the search engine on le soirs website or on google immediately brought up the article that wa undoubtedly a source of damage to g at least of a nonpecuniary nature such a situation made knowledge of his previous conviction easily accessible to a wide audience and wa thus liable to stigmatise him seriously damage his reputation and prevent him from reintegrating into society normally a causal link between the fault and the damage sustained had also been established acceding to g request did not confer on each and every individual a subjective right to rewrite history nor did it make it possible to falsify history or impose an excessive burden of responsibility on the applicant the court of appeal wa called upon to determine a specific dispute between two party in the context of a oneoff civil action for damage based on article of the civil code while seeking to ensure that a balance wa struck between two fundamental right claimed by the party the applicant further argued before the court of appeal that the way in which the database of le soir worked meant that it wa not possible to alter archived article and thus to replace g name with the letter x the court of appeal noted that in support of his claim the applicant had submitted a report drawn up by the newspaper technical department however the court considered that the report in question which had been prepared after the applicant had been given notice to appear by technician who were in a relationship of dependency with the applicant did not provide any guarantee of impartiality and had no probative value moreover the report did not state that it wa actually impossible to implement the measure requested but simply referred to the risk and cost the only reference to impossibility concerned the physical impossibility of withdrawing the newspaper that had been sold the collection that had been distributed and the numerous copy of the content available in physical and digital format in the public domain something that had not been requested the applicant appealed on point of law in one of his ground of appeal he alleged a violation of article of the convention in particular he argued in the first limb of the ground of appeal that the fault he had allegedly committed consisted in disregarding a subjective right namely the right to be forgotten although that right wa not enshrined either in clear precise and accessible domestic legislation or in a higherranking international rule but wa derived solely from the legal literature and caselaw hence in the applicant view the court of appeal judgment had breached the requirement that the interference be lawful in the second limb of the ground of appeal the applicant contended that the order for him to alter in the online archive the content of an article that had been published in the past and wa available in the paper archive amounted to unjustified interference with his freedom of expression in breach of article of the convention in a judgment of april the court of cassation dismissed the appeal on point of law it found that the first limb of the ground of appeal arguing that the court of appeal had based the right to be forgotten online on the legal literature and caselaw failed on factual ground the court of cassation held a follows it follows from the reasoning of the court of appeal judgment firstly that the judgment under challenge regard the right to be forgotten online a an intrinsic component of the right to respect for private life and indeed state so and view such interference with the right to freedom of expression a may be justified in order to protect that right a being based not on the legal literature and caselaw which the judgment doe not recognise a having general regulatory scope but on article of the convention article of the international covenant on civil and political right and article of the constitution and secondly that it refers to the judgment of the court of justice of the european union only to lend support to it view on the scope of that right to be forgotten a to the second limb the court of cassation held that the right to respect for private life which encompassed the right to be forgotten might justify interference with the right to freedom of expression the digital archiving of an old press article which at the time it wa printed had lawfully reported on past event that were now covered by the right to be forgotten wa not exempt from possible interference with the right to freedom of expression in order to protect the right to be forgotten such interference might consist in altering the archived text so a to prevent or make good a breach of the right to be forgotten the court of appeal had ruled lawfully that the online archiving of the article in question had amounted to a fresh disclosure of g previous conviction that wa liable to infringe his right to be forgotten the court of appeal had subsequently weighed up the right of the party and had provided legal justification for it ruling that the applicant by refusing to accede to the request for the article to be anonymised had committed a fault it had therefore lawfully ordered him to replace g first name and surname with the letter x on the website of le soir accordingly the second limb of the ground of appeal had to be dismissed it appears that the article in question is still available on the newspaper website but is accessible only to subscriber it is accompanied by a notice referring to the relevant judicial decision relevant legal framework and practice domestic law and practiceprotection of the fundamental right at stake and the right to be forgotten the belgian constitution guarantee freedom to manifest one opinion on all matter article and freedom of the press article a well a the right to respect for private and family life article prior to the event giving rise to the present

to privacy with the rule governing freedom of expression in it judgment of may case c euc google spain sl and google inc hereafter google spain the court of justice of the european union the cjeu wa called upon to define the extent of the right and obligation arising out of directive ec with regard to internet search engine the case originated in a complaint lodged by a spanish national with the spanish data protection agency against a spanish daily newspaper and google the applicant had complained that when an internet user entered his name in google search engine the list of result displayed link to two page of the newspaper mentioning his name in connection with an auction following attachment proceeding he had requested the newspaper either to remove or alter those page so that the personal data relating to him no longer appeared or to use certain tool made available by search engine in order to protect his data he had also requested google to remove or conceal the personal data relating to him so that they ceased to be included in the search result and in the link to the newspaper while the spanish agency had rejected the complaint against the newspaper it had upheld the complaint against google which brought an action before the spanish court it wa in the context of this judicial dispute that the case wa referred to the cjeu for a preliminary ruling the cjeu held that the operation carried out by operator of search engine should be classified a data processing of which they were the controller article b and d regardless of the fact that these data had already been published on the internet and had not been altered by the search engine it stated that in so far a the activity of a search engine could be distinguished from and wa additional to that carried out by publisher of website and also affected the fundamental right of the person concerned the operator of the search engine had to ensure in particular that the guarantee laid down by the directive could have full effect moreover given the ease with which information published on a website could be replicated on other site effective and complete protection of data user and particularly of their right to privacy could not be achieved if they had to obtain first or in parallel the erasure of the information relating to them from the publisher of website the cjeu concluded that the operator of a search engine wa obliged to remove link to web page that were published by third party and contained information relating to a person from the list of result displayed following a search made on the basis of that person name including in case where the name or information had not been erased beforehand or simultaneously from those web page and even a applicable when it publication on those page wa in itself lawful the cjeu added that even initially lawful processing of accurate data could in the course of time become incompatible with the directive where those data were no longer necessary in the light of the purpose for which they had been collected or processed that wa so in particular where they appeared to be inadequate irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive in relation to those purpose and in the light of the time that had elapsed the cjeu concluded that if under article and of the european union charter of fundamental right guaranteeing respectively the right to respect for private life and the right to the protection of personal data the person concerned had a right to ensure that the information in question relating to them personally should no longer be linked to their name by a list of result and they were thus entitled to request that the information in question no longer be made available to the general public on account of it inclusion in such a list of result those right overrode a a rule not only the economic interest of the operator of the search engine but also the interest of the general public in having access to that information through a search relating to the name of the person concerned however according to the cjeu that would not be the case if it appeared for particular reason such a the role played by the person concerned in public life that the interference with their fundamental right wa justified by the preponderant interest of the general public in having on account of it inclusion in the list of result access to the information in question regarding the difference in treatment between the publisher of a web page and the operator of a search engine the cjeu found a follows furthermore the processing by the publisher of a web page consisting in the publication of information relating to an individual may in some circumstance be carried out solely for journalistic purpose and thus benefit by virtue of article of directive from derogation from the requirement laid down by the directive whereas that doe not appear to be so in the case of the processing carried out by the operator of a search engine it can not therefore be ruled out that in certain circumstance the data subject is capable of exercising the right referred to in article b and subparagraph a of the first paragraph of article of directive against that operator but not against the publisher of the web page finally it must be stated that not only doe the ground under article of directive justifying the publication of a piece of personal data on a website not necessarily coincide with that which is applicable to the activity of search engine but also even where that is the case the outcome of the weighing of the interest at issue to be carried out under article f and subparagraph a of the first paragraph of article of the directive may differ according to whether the processing carried out by the operator of a search engine or that carried out by the publisher of the web page is at issue given that first the legitimate interest justifying the processing may be different and second the consequence of the processing for the data subject and in particular for his private life are not necessarily the same indeed since the inclusion in the list of result displayed following a search made on the basis of a person name of a web page and of the information contained on it relating to that person make access to that information appreciably easier for any internet user making a search in respect of the person concerned and may play a decisive role in the dissemination of that information it is liable to constitute a more significant interference with the data subject fundamental right to privacy than the publication on the web page in the guideline on the implementation of the court of justice of the european union judgment in the case of google spain sl and google inc v agencia española de protección de datos aepd and mario costeja gonzález c adopted on november the article data protection working party stated a follows search engine included in web page do not produce the same effect a external search engine on the one hand they only recover the information contained on specific web page on the other and even if a user look for the same person in a number of web page internal search engine will not establish a complete profile of the affected individual and the result will not have a serious impact on him therefore a a rule the right to delisting should not apply to search engine with a restricted field of action particularly in the case of search tool of website of newspaper from the material point of view and a it been already mentioned the ruling expressly state that the right only affect the result obtained on search made by the name of the individual and never suggests that the complete deletion of the page from the index of the search engine is needed the page should still be accessible using any other term of search it is worth mentioning that the ruling us the term name without further specification the second part of the guideline concern common criterion which the data protection authority are invited to apply in handling complaint following refusal of delisting by search engine the relevant part of the eighth and thirteenth criterion read a follows is the data processing causing prejudice to the data subject doe the data have a disproportionately negative privacy impact on the data subject the data might have a disproportionately negative impact on the data subject where a search result relates to a trivial or foolish misdemeanour which is no longer or may never have been the subject of public debate and where there is no wider public interest in the availability of the information doe the data relate to a criminal offence eu member state may have different approach a to the public availability of information about offender and their offence specific legal provision may exist which have an impact on the availability of such information over time data protection authority will handle such case in accordance with the relevant national principle and approach a a rule data protection authority are more likely to consider the delisting of search result relating to relatively minor offence that happened a long time ago whilst being le likely to consider the delisting of result relating to more serious one that happened more recently however these issue call for careful consideration and will be handled on a casebycase basis after the court of appeal had given it judgment in the present case regulation eu of the european parliament and of the council of april on the protection of natural person with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data the gdpr repealed directive ec of october article of the gdpr provides a follows article right to erasure right to be forgotten the data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following ground appliesa the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which they were collected or otherwise processed where the controller ha made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph to erase the personal data the controller taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation shall take reasonable step including technical measure to inform controller which are processing the personal data that the data subject ha requested the erasure by such controller of any link to or copy or replication of those personal data paragraph and shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessarya for exercising the right of freedom of expression and informationd for archiving purpose in the public interest scientific or historical research purpose or statistical purpose in accordance with article in so far a the right referred to in paragraph is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objective of that processing after the delivery of the judgment in ml and ww v germany cited above the cjeu delivered two judgment on september relating to request for a preliminary ruling concerning the obligation for operator of search engine to grant request for delisting dereferencing the case concerned are gc and others v commission nationale de linformatique et de libertés cnil c euc and google llc successor in law to google inc v commission nationale de linformatique et de libertés cnil c euc in the first judgment c the cjeu reiterated that the operator of search engine could be required to grant request for dereferencing nevertheless when they received a request to that effect they had to weigh up the right to privacy and the right to protection of personal data of the person making the request for dereferencing against the freedom of information of internet user potentially interested in accessing the information in question the cjeu referred to the judgment in ml and ww v germany cited above inferring from it that it wa for the operator of a search engine to ass in the context of a request for dereferencing relating to link to web page on which information is published relating to criminal proceeding brought against the data subject whether in the light of all the circumstance of the case such a in particular the nature and seriousness of the offence in question the progress and the outcome of the proceeding the time elapsed the part played by the data subject in public life and his past conduct the public interest at the time of the request the content and form of the publication and the consequence of publication for the data subject he or she ha a right to the information in question no longer in the present state of thing being linked with his or her name by a list of result displayed following a search carried out on the basis of that name in the second judgment c the cjeu specified that european union law did not require the operator of a search engine to carry out dereferencing on all version of it search engine nevertheless it wa required to do so on the version of the search engine corresponding to all the member state and to put in place measure to discourage internet user conducting a search from one of the member state from gaining access to the link in question found on non eu version of the search engine furthermore eu law did not prevent a supervisory or judicial authority of a member state from weighing up the fundamental right at stake in the light of national standard of protection of fundamental right and after weighing those right against each other from ordering the operator of such a search engine where appropriate to carry out dereferencing concerning all version of the search engine the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant alleged that the order for him to anonymise the archived version of the impugned article on the website of the newspaper le soir constituted a violation of freedom of expression freedom of the press and freedom to impart information he relied on article of the convention the relevant part of which provide everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the court note that the application is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merit the party submissionsa the applicanti lawfulness of the interference the applicant submitted that the judgment against him had not been based on a clear and foreseeable law enabling him to foresee the legal consequence of his action article of the civil code did not provide any clarification a to the type of restriction allowed their purpose duration and scope or the possibility of reviewing them the right to be forgotten a established in a handful of decision of the belgian court applied only to newly published material and not to the digital reproduction of an original article that had been archived in unaltered form the court of appeal had drawn an analogy with the cjeu judgment in the case of google spain transposing the principle established in that judgment regarding a search engine to a newspaper publisher it had equated newspaper publisher with search engine without taking into account the fact that they were not subject to the same obligation a newspaper publisher were granted exemption for journalistic purpose within the meaning of article of directive ce or the fact that the cjeu had expressly distinguished between these two type of activity furthermore the belgian court had previously held that the protection of private life act of december did not impose a timelimit on the press beyond which any information had to be disseminated in anonymous form by the person responsible for the processing or by a third party see paragraph above that act also expressly permitted journalist to process judicial data in the applicant view something that wa permitted under a specific law could not be prohibited by the ordinary rule on liability the applicant added that the few decision that had sanctioned the right to be forgotten on the basis of article of the civil code set out criterion that had been the subject of novel and therefore unforeseeable interpretation finding a the court of appeal had done in the instant case that the proceeding were not designed to punish the disclosure of past event but to obtain the removal of information available online amounted to a substantial change in the criterion for applying the right to be forgotten hitherto recognised by the caselaw in the applicant view the extensive interpretation of those criterion by the court of appeal conferred an absolute and automatic character on the right to be forgotten which meant that with the passage of time it wa possible to obtain the anonymisation of any electronic archive and hence of all newspaper judicial archive this would result in a gradual erosion of the integrity of the journalistic archive if it wa possible for anyone to have the information made anonymous there wa even a risk that the activity of archiving itself would disappear anonymisation therefore needed to be part of a particularly tight framework ensuring effective judicial review to prevent possible abuse lastly the applicant emphasised that the gdpr which incorporated the interpretation of the right to be forgotten given by the cjeu in it google spain judgment specifically provided for an exemption for the processing of data for archiving purpose in the public interest article d see paragraph aboveii necessity of the interference in the applicant view the judgment against him had not been strictly necessary in a democratic society the source of g grievance wa the fact that the article wa indexed by search engine rather than the article a such it wa search engine that brought the archive to light a decision should therefore have been taken to deindex the article rather than anonymising it a this wa le restrictive of freedom of expression there were significant issue at stake in the present case a request for anonymisation posed a serious threat to digital archiving recognising a right to be forgotten with regard to journalistic archive entailed a risk that this right would become a right to have information deleted or rewritten and hence a risk of undermining freedom to convey information and the very concept of archive which presupposed the existence of document in their original unaltered form the order for the applicant to anonymise the archive in question would have a chilling effect on freedom of expression and freedom of the press and would ultimately prompt him to cease electronic archiving furthermore the belgian court had not weighed up the competing interest at stake in accordance with the criterion established in the court caselaw in particular the assessment a to whether g wa known to the public had been incompatible with the court caselaw according to which individual could not complain of a loss of reputation which wa a foreseeable consequence of their own action such a the commission of a criminal offence a to the severity of the measure imposed the applicant submitted that other measure had existed that were le restrictive of freedom of expression such a making an addition to the news item published at the time referring to the order rehabilitating g or the delisting of the article by search engine such a google with regard to the last of these the applicant alleged that it had been up to g to submit a request for delisting to the operator of the search engine nevertheless in an effort to assist the applicant the newspaper legal department had itself requested google to delist the article in question but had received no response the applicant inferred from this that the reason given by the court of appeal and upheld by the court of cassation were insufficient to demonstrate that the interference had been necessary in a democratic society the court of cassation had merely found that the court of appeal judgment had been legally justified without replying to the argument raised by the applicant the applicant added that the right to be forgotten could not be transformed into a right for each individual to rewrite his or her personal history criminal conviction that had been the subject of public proceeding reported on by the press fell into the category of information that could legitimately be retained by the medium the information could be delisted if the relevant criterion were satisfied but it could not be censoredb the governmenti lawfulness of the interference the government observed that the foreseeability of the law should not translate into excessive rigidity in the present case the judgment against the applicant wa based on the provision of the convention and the constitution guaranteeing the right to protection of private life of which the right to be forgotten formed a part and on article of the civil code which together constituted a sufficiently foreseeable legal basis hence the interference with freedom of expression did not stem either from the belgian legal literature or caselaw or from the cjeus google spain judgment it wa acknowledged in the belgian ordinary rule on liability that a violation of the right to respect for private life of which the right to be forgotten wa a part constituted a fault resulting from a breach of a written rule of conduct hence the applicant could not have been unaware that he might be held liable article of the civil code wa sufficiently accessible clear precise and foreseeable taken together with article of the convention it formed a sufficiently foreseeable basis justifying interference with freedom of expression the fact that other court whether in belgium or elsewhere had reached a different conclusion wa irrelevant in so far a those court had applied the same reasoning which had resulted in different outcome depending on the specific circumstance of the case before them in any event any exemption allowed for journalist were not absolute and had to be weighed up in the light of the criterion established by the courtii necessity of the interference the government pointed out that neither the public right to be informed about past event nor the right to create online archive wa an absolute right in their view the initial interference with g exercise of his right to respect for his private life stemmed from the decision of the publisher of le soir to publish the information in question and to keep it online albeit without drawing the public attention to it the domestic court had examined all the legal and technical argument advanced by the party and had imposed a proportionate measure on the applicant taking into account the range of different measure proposed by him in particular they had deemed it insufficient to add a comment to the online article the court of appeal had opted for the anonymisation of the article after weighing up the interest at stake the government stressed that the integrity of the archive a such wa not impaired by the judgment given against the applicant but merely the public access to the online version of the article the paper archive remained intact and people like researcher could still request access to the nonanonymised digital version of the article the case wa to be distinguished from that of ml and ww v germany no and june in view of the particular circumstance of the case and especially the fact that g wa not well known the fact that he had had no contact with the medium and the minimal interest of the event reported on in the article the information had become damaging precisely because of the passage of time and the article had been published online more than fifteen year after publication of the print version the present case wa therefore also to be distinguished in term of the fact from the judgment in węgrzynowski and smolczewski v poland no july in conclusion the government observed that the belgian court had determined a specific dispute between two party in the context of a civil action for damage while seeking to ensure that a balance wa struck between two competing fundamental right claimed by the party they had taken their decision after examining the criterion established by the court and striking a reasonable balance between the interest at stake there were therefore no sufficiently strong reason for the court to substitute it assessment for that of the domestic court submission of the thirdparty intervener the thirdparty intervener g wa the person who had requested anonymisation of his name in the article in issue in his view the applicant had displayed excessive zeal in objecting to the request a to the fact he pointed out in particular that although he had himself in the proceeding before the court of first instance proposed the use of a noindex tag a an alternative to anonymisation it wa the applicant who had subsequently rejected that solution in g view article of the civil code taken in conjunction with the right to be forgotten a recognised by the caselaw and legal literature a an integral part of the right to respect for private life constituted a sufficiently foreseeable legal basis satisfying the requirement of article of the convention a to the necessity of the interference he stressed the fact that the article belonged to the past which meant that it attracted a lesser degree of protection the significant repercussion of republication of the article on the internet a a result of the publication of the archive online and the complete lack of any public interest in the inclusion of his full name in the article furthermore it wa not a question of requiring the medium to remove all personal data from their archive a a blanket measure or to remove the data of anyone who so requested but of requiring them to ass the fundamental right at stake in context the court assessment it is not disputed that the civil judgment against the applicant ordering him to anonymise the impugned article amounted to interference with his right under article of the convention an interference with the right to convey information or idea will infringe the convention if it doe not meet the requirement of paragraph of article it should therefore be determined whether the interference wa prescribed by law whether it pursued one or more of the legitimate aim set out in that paragraph and whether it wa necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve the relevant aim or aimsa lawfulness of the interference the applicant alleged that the judgment against him had not been foreseeable the general principle concerning the requirement of foreseeability of the law under article of the convention are summarised in the judgment in delfi a v estonia gc no echr see also more recently satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june magyar kétfarkú kutya párt v hungary gc no january and selahattin demirtaş v turkey no gc no december the court must seek to ascertain whether the way in which the domestic court applied article of the civil code which constitutes the ordinary rule on liability to the applicant situation wa foreseeable in so doing it will take account of the domestic legal framework a a whole that is to say both the written norm that were applied and the general principle stemming from the legislation and the caselaw see delfi a cited above the court observes at the outset that belgian law recognises a right to be forgotten a an integral part of the right to respect for private life see paragraph above a pointed out by the court of cassation in the present case that right flow from article of the convention article of the international covenant on civil and political right and article of the constitution see paragraph above the court of appeal relied on these provision in particular in recognising g right to be forgotten see paragraph above interpreting the scope of the right to be forgotten is a matter for the national authority notably the court which have primary responsibility for interpreting domestic law unless the interpretation is arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable the court role is confined to ascertaining whether the effect of the interpretation are compatible with the convention see radomilja and others v croatia gc no and march s v and a v denmark gc no and others october and molla sali v greece gc no december the question raised by the applicant before the domestic court wa whether g satisfied the relevant criterion in order to claim the right to be forgotten in so far a in the applicant view the article in question wa not newly published material but an archived version of an old article in this regard the court of cassation upheld the interpretation of the court of appeal which had found that the online publication of the archived version of the article amounted to fresh disclosure of g previous conviction see paragraph above the court can not subscribe to the applicant view that the court of appeal in referring to the cjeu judgment in google spain had equated newspaper publisher with search engine a explained by the court of cassation the court of appeal had referred to the abovementioned judgment which concerned a search engine only for the purpose of determining the scope of the right to be forgotten per se in the court view this interpretation by the national court of the provision concerning the protection of private life wa neither arbitrary nor manifestly unreasonable returning to article of the civil code this provision requires a person to make good any damage caused through his or her fault including the unjustified infringement of a right this provision serf a the basis for civil action for alleged abuse of press freedom see paragraph above accordingly the court is not persuaded by the applicant argument that it had not been foreseeable that judgment might be given against him on the basis of the ordinary rule on liability on account of an infringement of the right to be forgotten stemming from the digital reproduction of an old article it observes in that connection that the fact that a legal provision is applied for the first time in a certain type of case doe not suffice to establish a lack of foreseeability see satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above magyar kétfarkú kutya párt cited above and selahattin demirtaş cited above likewise the fact that there are example of case in which the court ruled differently is not sufficient to establish a lack of foreseeability since all the circumstance of the case must be taken into account in matter that involve the balancing of right this is especially true since the caselaw to which the applicant referred had a different legal basis namely the protection of private life act of december see paragraph above see conversely rtbf v belgium no echr moreover the court note that in previous case examined under article of the convention it ha accepted a provision constituting the ordinary rule on civil liability a a sufficiently foreseeable legal basis see with regard to article of the belgian civil code de haes and gijsels v belgium february report of judgment and decision i and leempoel sa ed ciné revue v belgium no november for case concerning other state in which the interference with freedom of expression wa also based on the ordinary rule of liability see for instance węgrzynowski and smolczewski cited above and ml and ww v germany cited above it follows from the foregoing that the judgment given against the applicant had a legal basis that satisfied the foreseeability requirement the interference wa therefore prescribed by lawb legitimate aim the party agreed that the interference had pursued a legitimate aim within the meaning of article namely the protection of the reputation or right of others in this case g right to respect for his private lifec necessity of the interference the court emphasis that a in the case of ml and ww v germany cited above it is not the lawfulness of the article when it wa first published that is in issue but the fact that it wa made available on the internet and the possibility of accessing the article a long time after the event the task of the national court wa to balance the various right at stake the freedom of expression of the applicant a a publisher and in particular his right to convey information to the public on the one hand and g right to protection of his private life on the other the court will first reiterate the principle concerning the balancing of the right in issue and the criterion to be taken into account in assessing the necessity of an interference with freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the convention especially where a in the present case the issue concern a digital archive available on the internet i it will then apply those criterion to the particular circumstance of the case iii the applicable general principlesα balancing of the right the court refers to the general principle a set out in numerous judgment concerning the balancing of the right guaranteed by article and of the convention see among other authority axel springer ag v germany gc no february couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no echr extract bédat v switzerland gc no march and satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above a it ha held repeatedly these right a a matter of principle deserve equal respect see among other authority axel springer ag cited above von hannover v germany no gc no and cedh delfi a cited above and couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above and bédat cited above the court ha already had occasion in examining an initial publication to lay down the relevant principle which must guide it assessment and more importantly that of the domestic court a to whether an instance of interference wa necessary it ha thus identified a number of criterion in the context of balancing the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life the criterion are a follows i contribution to a debate of public interest ii whether the person concerned is known to the public and the subject of the news report iii the prior conduct of the person concerned iv the way in which the information wa obtained and it veracity v the content form and consequence of the publication and vi the severity of the measure imposed see axel springer ag cited above and satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above and the reference therein see also the cjeu judgment in gc and others v commission nationale de linformatique et de libertés cnil cited at paragraph above according to the court caselaw the test of necessity in a democratic society requires the court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a pressing social need and in particular whether the reason given by the national authority to justify it were relevant and sufficient and whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued see the sunday time v the united kingdom no april series a no and vavřička and others v the czech republic gc no and others april the court further reiterates that under article of the convention the contracting state enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed under that provision is necessary however this margin go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those delivered by an independent court in exercising it supervisory function the court task is not to take the place of the national court but rather to review in the light of the case a a whole whether the decision they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation are compatible with the provision of the convention relied on see axel springer ag cited above where the balancing exercise ha been undertaken by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the court would require strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see among other authority axel springer ag cited above couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above bédat cited above and satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above β the specific nature of online publication of digital archive the great majority of case concerning a conflict between the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life examined by the court have related to the initial publication of information about private aspect of the life of individual or their family see among many other authority hachette filipacchi associés ici paris v france no july axel springer ag cited above couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above and more recently falzon v malta no march unlike those case the present case concern the online publication in and the continued availability to date of the archived version of an article originally published in in the print edition of the newspaper le soir in a situation where the lawfulness of the initial publication is not disputed in response to a request to that effect by g the domestic court ordered the applicant to anonymise the digital archive of the impugned article by replacing g full name with the letter x the court ha previously held that in addition to it primary function the press ha a secondary but nonetheless valuable role in maintaining archive containing news which ha previously been reported and making them available to the public internet archive make a substantial contribution to preserving and making available news and information digital archive constitute an important source for education and historical research particularly a they are readily accessible to the public and are generally free see time newspaper ltd v the united kingdom no and no and and echr węgrzynowski and smolczewski cited above fuchsmann v germany no october and ml and ww v germany cited above in a case such a the present one the right of a person who ha been the subject of content available on the internet must therefore be balanced against the public right to be informed about past event and contemporary history in particular through the use of digital press archive see ml and ww v germany cited above in that connection the court is keenly aware of the risk of a chilling effect on freedom of the press posed by a requirement for a publisher to anonymise an article whose lawfulness ha not been questioned the obligation to examine at a later stage the lawfulness of keeping a report online following a request from the person concerned which implies weighing up all the interest at stake entail a risk that the press might refrain from keeping report in it online archive or omit individualised element in report likely to be the subject of such a request see ml and ww v germany cited above the court is also mindful of the fact that the alteration of the archived version of an article undermines the integrity of the archive and thus their very essence the domestic court must therefore be particularly vigilant whenever they grant a request for anonymisation or alteration of the electronic version of an archived article on the ground of respect for private life that being said the right to keep archive available to the public online is not an absolute right but must be balanced against the other right at stake in this context in the court view the criterion to be taken into account regarding the online publication or continued availability of archived material are in principle the same a those applied by the court in the context of initial publication nevertheless certain criterion may have more or le relevance given the particular circumstance of the case and the passage of time see to similar effect ml and ww v germany cited above see also satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above ii application of these principle in the present caseα contribution to a debate of public interest a to the existence of a debate of public interest not diminished by the passage of time see ml and ww v germany cited above the court stress the fact that by their very nature archive contribute to a debate of public interest in a different way from an initial publication above all digital archive constitute an important source for education and historical research see paragraph above and for placing current event in context the weight to be given to this criterion in balancing the interest at stake must therefore be tailored to the specific nature of such archive in the present case the court of appeal correctly observed that the online publication of the article did not have any value in term of newsworthiness see paragraph above it held that twenty year after the event the identity of a person who wa not a public figure did not enhance the public interest of the impugned article which merely contributed at a statistical level to a general debate on road safety the article concerned a series of admittedly tragic event whose contribution to a debate of public interest related mainly to the hazard of road traffic and the cause of those hazard hence the court note the court of appeal finding that mentioning g full name wa not apt twenty year after the event to contribute to a debate of public interest see conversely ml and ww v germany cited above β whether the person concerned wa known to the public and the subject of the article a to whether the person concerned wa known to the public and the subject of the article it is true that the court ha previously found a pointed out by the applicant that article of the convention can not be relied on in order to complain of a loss of reputation which is the foreseeable consequence of one own action such a the commission of a criminal offence see axel springer ag cited above gillberg v sweden gc no april medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june ml and ww v germany cited above and denisov v ukraine gc no september however this doe not mean that a person with a past criminal conviction may never claim the right to be forgotten were this so that right would be devoid of substance the court considers that after a certain amount of time ha passed person who have been convicted may have an interest in no longer being confronted with their act with a view to their reintegration in society see ml and ww v germany cited above and the reference contained therein a stated by the court of appeal the electronic archiving of an article concerning the commission of an offence must not create a kind of virtual criminal record for the person concerned see paragraph above this is particularly true where a in the present case the person ha served his or her sentence and been rehabilitated although after the commission of a criminal offence and while the trial is ongoing a hitherto unknown person may acquire a degree of notoriety that notoriety may also decline with the passage of time see ml and ww v germany cited above indeed the public interest a regard criminal proceeding will vary in degree ibid thus in some case the right to be forgotten may confer on the person concerned the right to revert to being simply an individual unknown to the public again time is a very important factor in this regard in the present case the court of appeal observed that g did not hold any public office see paragraph above he wa a private individual unknown to the general public at the time of his request for anonymisation see conversely ml and ww v germany cited above the fact for which he had been convicted were not the subject of any medium coverage with the exception of the impugned article either at the time of the event reported on or when the archived version of the article wa published on the internetγ the conduct of the person concerned with regard to the medium the domestic court did not rule expressly on the issue of g conduct with regard to the medium the court note that g did not at any time contact the medium to publicise his situation either when the article first appeared in or when it wa published online in see conversely ml and ww v germany cited above it is clear from his letter to le soir requesting the removal or anonymisation of the article see paragraph above that on the contrary he made every effort to stay out of the medium spotlightδ how the information wa obtained and it veracity the veracity of the fact related in the article wa not disputed by g see mutatis mutandis ml and ww v germany cited above and conversely węgrzynowski and smolczewski cited above likewise g did not allege that the information had been obtained in breach of journalistic ethic moreover the court of appeal found that it wa not disputed that the initial disclosure of the information had been lawful see paragraph aboveε the content form and consequence of the publication firstly a regard the content of the article in question it dealt with several roadtraffic accident which had occurred within the space of a few day in the accident caused by g wa one of them see paragraph above secondly with regard to the form of the publication an issue on which the domestic court likewise did not rule expressly the court reiterates that internet site are an information and communication tool particularly distinct from the printed medium especially a regard the capacity to store and transmit information and that the risk of harm posed by content and communication on the internet to the exercise and enjoyment of human right and freedom particularly the right to respect for private life is certainly higher than that posed by printed publication see editorial board of pravoye delo and shtekel v ukraine no echr extract węgrzynowski and smolczewski cited above delfi a cited above and ml and ww v germany cited above the court ha inferred from this that the policy governing reproduction of material from the printed medium and the internet may differ see editorial board of pravoye delo and shtekel cited above and węgrzynowski and smolczewski cited above the same is true a regard paper and digital archive a the scope of the latter is much greater and the repercussion on the private life of the individual who are named are correspondingly more serious an effect that is further amplified by search engine a to the extent to which the archived version of the article wa disseminated the court take account of the fact that consulting archive requires an active search which involves entering keywords on the web page containing the newspaper archive given it location on the website the article in issue wa not likely to attract the attention of those internet user who were not seeking information about g likewise the court doe not doubt that maintaining access to the article wa not intended to redisseminate information about g see to similar effect ml and ww v germany cited above the court nevertheless note that in the instant case at the time of g request and throughout the domestic proceeding access to the archive of the newspaper le soir wa unrestricted and free of charge compare with ml and ww v germany cited above where certain article were accessible only behind a paywall or for subscriber the applicant pointed out that in the present case the judgment had not been against the operator of the search engine but against the publisher of a newspaper whose article were accessible online like the cjeu the court accepts that the obligation of search engine may differ from those of the entity which originally published the information see ml and ww v germany cited above see also paragraph above it is also true that it is primarily because of search engine that the information on individual that is held by the medium outlet concerned can easily be found by internet user see ml and ww v germany cited above however it can not be overlooked that the very fact that a newspaper post an article on it website ha an impact on the visibility of the information in question thus the initial interference with g right to respect for his private life resulted from the applicant decision to publish that information on his website and especially to keep it available there even without the intention of attracting the public attention ibid thirdly a to the consequence of publication the court of appeal noted that a simple search using g first name and surname on the search engine of le soir or on google immediately brought up the article see paragraph above the court of appeal held that keeping the impugned article online wa therefore liable to cause indefinite and serious harm to g reputation by giving him a already observed see paragraph above a virtual criminal record despite the fact that he had not only served his sentence after a final conviction for the offence but had also been formally rehabilitated in the court view this assessment by the court of appeal can not be regarded a arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable with the passage of time individual should have the opportunity to rebuild their life without being confronted with their past mistake by member of the public see mutatis mutandis österreichischer rundfunk v austria no december and ml and ww v germany cited above name search have become commonplace in today society and more often than not people conduct such search for reason wholly unconnected to any prosecution or conviction of the person concernedστ the severity of the measure imposed on the applicant lastly a regard the severity of the measure imposed on the applicant the court must seek to ascertain whether the domestic court took into account the impact of the measure on the applicant and le soir and whether they examined within the limit of the case before them whether other measure le restrictive of freedom of expression could be considered the court note that in the proceeding before the domestic court the applicant maintained that a balance between the right at stake could be achieved by mean of a right to rectification or communication that is to say by adding further information to the impugned article the court of appeal took the view that such a procedure would not be appropriate in the present case a it would allow the stigmatising effect of the offence committed by g and of the sentence he had already served to persist indefinitely and would render the rehabilitation order given in his favour meaningless before the court the applicant subsequently alleged that the court of appeal had not made clear why the addition by le soir of a noindex tag would be insufficient to secure g right to respect for his private life he also alleged referring in particular to the cjeus google spain judgment that g should have asked search engine like google to delist the impugned article the court note that in the court of appeal proceeding the applicant argued that only the search engine were competent to deal with g request and that the latter had erroneously directed his request against the applicant a to the addition by le soir of a noindex tag on the article it doe not appear from the document in the domestic case file to which the court ha access that the applicant argued before the lower court that the addition of such a tag would suffice to secure g right to respect for private life in any event the court of appeal noted that at the time of delivery of it judgment the article in question wa still available on the website of le soir without any noindex tag a to the delisting of the article by search engine the court considers that the relevance of such a measure is to be assessed in the context of the case brought before the court a g request wa directed against the applicant alone the court can not be criticised for simply examining the admissibility and merit of that request it is true that it wa open to le soir to take the initiative and itself request the search engine to delist the article in question in response to the request it had received from g to ensure respect for his private life the applicant stated that the newspaper legal department had in fact contacted google for that purpose but had received no reply see paragraph above a g did not request delisting of the article by the search engine in the context of his dispute with the applicant and the latter did not have it delisted a an alternative to anonymisation the court considers it unnecessary to examine in the abstract whether delisting wa apt to achieve a fair balance between the interest at stake likewise in so far a the matter wa not raised in the proceeding before the domestic court it is not the court task to consider of it own motion possible alternative method le restrictive of the applicant right to freedom of expression that might have been used in the present case the court of appeal took the view that the most effective mean of protecting g privacy without disproportionately interfering with the applicant freedom of expression wa to anonymise the article posted on le soirs website by replacing g first name and surname with the letter x see paragraph above in reply to an argument advanced by the applicant it stressed the fact that he had not been requested to remove the article from the archive but simply to render the electronic version anonymous the paper archive remained intact and the applicant could still ensure the integrity of the original digital version see paragraph above replying to a further argument by the applicant citing the technical impossibility of altering archived article the court of appeal considered that the impossibility of doing so had not been established see paragraph above with regard to archive the court attache considerable weight to the fact that the nature of the measure imposed in the present case preserved the integrity of the archived article since it wa only a matter of anonymising the online version of the article and the applicant wa allowed to keep the original digital and paper archive a pointed out by the government this meant in particular that anyone interested in the original version of the article could still request access to it including in digital form see paragraph above it wa therefore not the article itself but merely the ability to access it on the website of le soir that wa affected by the measure a to the court of appeal assessment of the technical feasibility for the applicant of anonymising the article on the website of le soir the applicant did not adduce any evidence capable of persuading the court that this assessment wa arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable in view of the foregoing the court considers that the national court were entitled to conclude that the test a to the proportionality of the interference with the right to freedom of expression wa satisfied see paragraph aboveiii conclusion in the light of the consideration outlined above the court considers that the domestic court weighed in the balance g right to respect for his private life and the applicant right to freedom of expression in accordance with the criterion established in it caselaw specifically the court of appeal attached particular weight to the damage sustained by g on account of the online publication of the article in question having regard in particular to the passage of time since the publication of the original article and to the fact that the anonymisation of the article on the website of le soir left the archive themselves intact and constituted the most effective measure amongst those that could have been taken in the present case without interfering disproportionately with the applicant freedom of expression in the court view the reason given by the domestic court were relevant and sufficient it see no strong reason which would require it to substitute it view for that of the domestic court and to set aside the balancing exercise carried out by them it therefore find that the measure imposed can be regarded a proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and a striking a fair balance between the competing right at stake accordingly in the specific circumstance of the present case there ha been no violation of article of the convention the court wish to make it clear that it finding can not be interpreted a entailing an obligation for the medium to check their archive on a systematic and permanent basis without prejudice to their duty to respect private life at the time of the initial publication of an article when it come to archiving the article they are required to carry out a check and thus weigh the right at stake only if they receive an express request to that effect for these reason the courtdeclares unanimously the application admissible hold by six vote to one that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in french and notified in writing on june pursuant to rule and of the rule of court signature_p_milan blaško georgios a serghides registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the separate opinion of judge pavli is annexed to this judgment gasmbdissenting opinion of judge pavli the current case involves a conflict between the right of the press and the general public to preserve the integrity of press archive versus the right of an individual not to be confronted with a permanent criminal record in the online domain which is one aspect of what ha come to be known a the right to be forgotten on the fact it is a situation whereby one person right to online privacy can be quite effectively protected at the level of search engine without it being necessary to interfere directly with the relevant archived material a situation that by definition raise serious question of necessity in a democratic society it is a crucial consideration that ha been ignored by the domestic ruling which the majority upholds based on a weak procedural argument and with little attention to the general ramification of this potentially farreaching judgment in my view by ordering the applicant to anonymise an archived online article containing information about an old crime committed by the plaintiff in the domestic proceeding mr g the belgian court failed to strike a fair balance between the competing interest protected by article and article of the convention respectively in ratifying the balancing exercise carried out by the national court the judgment go against an emerging but clear european consensus that righttobeforgotten claim in the online realm can and should be effectively addressed through deindexation of search engine result while preserving the integrity of the original historical material unless the privacy claimant can show that for some exceptional reason deindexation would not be sufficient or adequate in the specific case finally the methodological approach followed by the majority in applying the von hannover criterion to the current case is also questionable in my view the essential role of digital press archive i recall at the outset that the court ha repeatedly emphasised the substantial contribution made by digital press archive to preserving and making available news and information thereby constituting an important source for education and historical research see węgrzynowski and smolczewski v poland no july and time newspaper ltd v the united kingdom no and no and echr the maintenance of internet archive is a critical aspect of the role of the press in a democracy ibid the court ha further noted that even with respect to defamatory material it is not the role of judicial authority to engage in rewriting history by ordering the removal from the public domain of all trace of publication which have in the past been found by final judicial decision to amount to unjustified attack on individual reputation see węgrzynowski and smolczewski cited above it follows a fortiori that only very compelling reason can justify direct interference with archived medium content whose legality at the time of the original publication ha not been questioned retrospective cleansing of digital press archive interferes not only with the public article right to be informed about past event and contemporary history but also with the publisher freedom of journalistic expression protected by the same provision in this context the court ha recognised that granting such anonymisation request can have a broader chilling effect on freedom of expression according to the court the obligation to examine the lawfulness of a report at a later stage following an anonymisation request from the person concerned which implies weighing up all the interest at stake would entail a risk that the press might refrain from keeping report in it online archive or that it would omit individualised element in report likely to be the subject of such a request see ml and ww v germany no and june the court observed in that regard that the most careful scrutiny under article is required where measure or sanction imposed on the press are capable of discouraging the participation of the press in debate on matter of legitimate public concern ibid to fulfil their article function digital press archive must be complete and historically accurate any tampering with their content could undermine their underlying purpose which is to maintain a full historical record keeping in mind also that it is not possible to know beforehand which particular information stored in them will at some future point become of renewed public interest for example journalist and others have a legitimate interest in building a moral profile of a political candidate by gathering or crosschecking various fact about his or her past in such a situation the person criminal record may gain new significance whether or not any prior conviction are considered to be spent see jankauskas v lithuania no no june where the court found that spent conviction can legitimately be relied on for the purpose of evaluating a person moral stature in the case of emergent public figure the watchdog function can be seriously compromised if press archive have in the meantime been unnecessarily sanitised in view of the above there is little scope under the convention for measure that have the effect of permanently interfering with the historical record i should note at this point that it make little difference that the historical material ha been left untouched in the printed version of the archive considering that presentday newsgathering investigative journalism and scholarly research rely to a great degree on online source in fact the court ha stressed that the importance of digital press archive stem particularly from the fact that they are readily accessible to the public and are generally free see ml and ww v germany cited above while a person privacy and right to rehabilitation should be generally protected from the casual curiosity of the online mass that doe not necessarily justify the complete erasure of the historical record emerging european consensus on the right to be forgotten it is important to consider the case at hand in the context of the emerging european consensus on balancing private and public interest in case involving press archive an important reference in this regard is the cjeus ruling in google spain to which today judgment refers extensively see paragraph of the judgment at issue in google spain wa an archived online article fully lawful at the time of publication containing a person name in connection with an auction that followed attachment proceeding the cjeu established a data protection remedy that consists in delisting web page containing personal data from namebased search engine result but ensuring that no information get deleted or altered in the original source the cjeus reasoning rested in part on the distinction between the legal regime applicable to general search engine and that applicable to primary publisher with the crucial difference being that only the latter can benefit from journalistic exemption under european union data protection principle the cjeu pointed out that a a result of this difference the data subject will in certain circumstance be capable of exercising his data protection right against the search engine operator but not against the publisher of the web page see paragraph of the cjeu judgment in the same vein the outcome of the weighing of the competing interest at issue may be different in each of the two scenario given that first the legitimate interest justifying the processing may be different and second the consequence of the processing for the data subject and in particular for his private life are not necessarily the same paragraph regarding specifically the consequence of data processing for private life the cjeu found that the inclusion of a web page in namebased search result is liable to constitute a more significant interference with the data subject fundamental right to privacy than the publication on the web page given that the inclusion of information in the search result make access to that information appreciably easier for any internet user making a search in respect of the person concerned and may play a decisive role in the dissemination of that information paragraph in this connection it is important to bear in mind that general search engine have a transformational impact on personal privacy because they allow user to build a complete profile of a person life drawing on practically every piece of information available online in a way that wa not possible in the pre internet day this make general search engine unique in a way that doe not apply to digital press archive or even the search engine of one individual website in continuity with previous eu data protection rule and the google spain judgment the upgraded eu general data protection regulation gdpr expressly lay down the right to erasure of personal data on ground enumerated in article this right is however subject to limitation to the extent that processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information article a the gdpr also provides for exemption and derogation for processing carried out for journalistic purpose if they are necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the freedom of expression and information article recital of the gdpr make it clear that this applies in particular to the processing of personal data in news archive and press library in the year since the google spain judgment delisting of namebased search result ha become a wellestablished and functional remedy in europe in case concerning righttobeforgotten claim relating to press publication there is in fact strong comparative evidence pointing towards a reluctance on the part of domestic court to edit the past by anonymising archive with remedy at the level of search engine being favoured instead by way of example i refer to a recent judgment of the spanish constitutional court in a b v ediciones el país which dealt with fact not dissimilar to those at issue in the current case the constitutional court held that once access to the online article in question had been impeded through it deindexation from general search engine and from the internal search engine of el país it wa no longer necessary to alter it content to satisfy the privacy claim since the dissemination of the article had been reduced both quantitatively and qualitatively by disassociating it from the identity of the person concerned also notable is a judgment of the german federal constitutional court of november which introduced a nuanced methodology for balancing private and public interest in case concerning digital press archive with an emphasis on examining all available technical option before resorting to altering the historical record directly while leaving the balancing exercise in casu to the ordinary court the high german court stressed that the aim is to strike a balance that preserve unrestricted access to the original text to the greatest extent possible while also ensuring that where protection is merited in the individual case especially in relation to namebased search via search engine sufficient limitation are put in place paragraph in it methodological guidance to the lower court the federal constitutional court focused on the actual dissemination and visibility of the original publication on the internet see paragraph and an aspect that is also crucial in the present case the allterrain von hannover criterion turning now to our own methodology for considering righttobeforgotten request the majority have resorted to the criterion developed in von hannover v germany no gc no and echr a the general matrix for resolving conflict between article and article interest in fairness the court ha previously followed the same approach in ml and ww v germany cited above the deployment of the von hannover criterion together with the similar but not identical test adopted in axel springer ag v germany gc no february in order to resolve all conflict ranging from invasion of privacy to defamation dispute and now matter of informational selfdetermination ha generated a measure of criticism from both outside and inside the court it ha been argued for example that defamation case differ in many significant respect from privacy tort and that at least some of the criterion developed in von hannover are not equally relevant or transposable to the reputational context i have some sympathy for this line of argument considering that it may be somewhat rigid and overambitious to seek to apply a single set of criterion to the very diverse range of conflict that may arise between article and interest this is especially so in view of the growing scope and diversity of claim that the court ha recognised a falling with the remit of article be that a it may the current context raise an even more challenging question why should the von hannover criterion be applied by default to a dispute about a publication whose original legality is not in question and whose courtordered editing is requested in the name of substantially different consideration for example the notoriety of the person concerned or the contribution of the material to matter of public interest are much more easily assessable at the moment of the original publication in contrast when interference with the archived material is requested many year after the event it is also necessary to consider the potential utility and relevance of the publication at some future time this is an inherently uncertain ponderation and therefore the presumption must be in favour of not interfering directly with original archive material for these reason i fear that the von hannover criterion may have reached the limit of their usefulness in this context it is worth recalling here that the eu regulatory framework on the right to be forgotten relies on a simpler set of criterion that are more germane to the context of personal data protection though certainly not without their own interpretative challenge delisting versus editing of the press archive in the present case turning to the merit of the present case i do not question that the plaintiff in the domestic proceeding had a legitimate article interest in not being casually confronted with his spent conviction with a view to his reintegration in society it is however important to pinpoint where exactly that interest lay he took the initial step against le soir because he realised that the article at issue appeared among the top search result when his name wa typed into search engine see paragraph of the judgment in his submission to this court mr g sought to demonstrate the impact of the archived article on his private life precisely by reference to the fact that the article featured prominently in the search result linked to his name on a major search engine and on the internal search engine of le soir see paragraph of the thirdparty submission it is also notable even though not decisive that mr g wa prepared to accept a an alternative remedy the delisting of the article from search engine result for query containing his name should anonymisation of the article prove technically impossible see paragraph of the judgment it is clear from the above that the plaintiff root concern wa with the online search result not the article itself with this in mind his legitimate interest in not being confronted with the article in question in his daily personal and professional life could have been adequately protected by removing the article from namebased search result on general search engine according to current statistic more than percent of belgian internet user tend to use one of two major search engine such a measure would have prevented the article from becoming easily accessible through curiositydriven or other random search query at the same time it would have preserved the integrity of the press archive and allowed full access to the unaltered original source to those person journalist researcher or others who might become specifically interested in the past event covered in the article while delisting remains a significant interference with the freedom to receive and impart information and idea it is still le onerous for the applicant and le detrimental to his article right it can not be excluded that in certain circumstance a privacy interest may be so strong a to warrant the anonymisation of an archived news article where a person make a compelling case that the harm caused to him or her a a result of an online publication can not be undone by delisting other remedy may need to be considered put differently for anonymisation to be compatible with article a person must show that substantial harm to his or her private life doe not result merely from a piece of information being easily discoverable but rather from the fact that the information continues to exist in the online space at all for example when it involves particularly sensitive personal data or especially vulnerable person however no such special circumstance are present in the instant case how do the majority deal with this conundrum they find that since the plaintiff had not requested deindexation from the search engine and had in fact chosen to go after the newspaper archive it wa not for the national court or for this court to consider possible alternative in the abstract see paragraph of the judgment in other word because the plaintiff ha demanded that the neighbour wall be taken down in order to get rid of some graffiti on it let the plaintiff have his wish alternative and proportionality be damned i am not persuaded that the belgian court seriously considered any readily available alternative to direct interference with the archived material in this case the majority have therefore upheld domestic decision that failed to engage in the kind of careful balancing that other national and supranational court across the continent have sought to develop in this delicate context while one ought to have sympathy for the predicament of the plaintiff in the domestic proceeding we can not ignore the broader consequence of the precedent we are creating in conclusion today judgment stand in strong tension with the principle of our own jurisprudence on the integrity of press archive a well a the emerging european consensus on the application of the right to be forgotten in adopting this judgment the court may have opened the door with no good reason in my view to the facile cleansing of the journalistic record case c euc google spain sl and google inc it is notable that the liège court of appeal took note of google spain in it decision in the case at hand and wa therefore aware of the newly established remedy see paragraph of the judgment see article data protection working party guideline on the implementation of the court of justice of the european union judgment in the case of google spain sl and google inc v agencia española de protección de datos aepd and mario costeja gonzález c adopted on november see for instance the recent judgment of the high court of england and wale in nt and nt v google and the information commissioner ewhc qb and the judgment of the french court of cassation first civil division may no judgment june bv r november see among others h tomlinson privacy and defamation strasbourg blur the boundary january at inforrmorg and s e gale defamation and the misuse of private information a comparative analysis tort law review at see although in a more specific context the joint dissenting opinion of judge sajó and karakaş in satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june see paragraph above i am also unable to follow the majority suggestion that the applicant entity should have requested deindexation from the search engine while the rightsholder wa not prepared to do so himself this would be against the principle of data protection and it is not surprising that the search engine failed to act on a third party request,,,

on clothes the applicant refused to dress the sheriff allowed him to be present in court after a screen covering the lower half of his body wa hastily constructedi the evidence the two police officer who had arrested the applicant gave evidence police officer a described edinburgh road a a major route into perth from the motorway it wa a busy road and at the material time there wa a continuous flow of traffic along the road he wa firmly of the view that the applicant nudity in a public place would cause alarm to anyone during crossexamination by the applicant police officer a agreed that the human body wa in itself decent and wa not harmful or alarming he accepted that nothing in the applicant behaviour at the time of his arrest other than his nakedness gave the police any cause for concern police officer b gave evidence that she considered the fact that the applicant had no clothes on in a public place to be very strange and unusual and that she wa quite shocked by it she explained that at the time edinburgh road had been very busy with vehicular and pedestrian traffic she had previously seen elderly people and child in the area and there were school and housing nearby in crossexamination she also agreed that the human body in itself wa not harmful indecent or bad but maintained that although she had been forewarned that she would be likely to see a naked man in public she had still been shocked she confirmed that no complaint had been received from member of the public the applicant gave evidence in his defence when asked by the prosecution why he wa wearing no clothes he replied that he wa making a stand and that were innocent until we do something wrong he did not believe that he wa causing harm by not wearing clothes he said that he did not wear clothes in order to provoke a reaction although he had not always been like that a he had grown older he had thought more about his belief when asked what he hoped to achieve by making his stand the applicant replied that he did it because he felt that it wa right and that the world changed in it own wayii the conviction and sentence the sheriff found the applicant guilty of breach of the peace and contempt of court he considered that being naked in a public place and refusing to wear clothes in a public place wa conduct that would be alarming and disturbing in it context to any reasonable person in his stated case prepared in the context of the applicant later appeal the sheriff explained there wa no dispute on the fact of the case i accepted that the police officer were concerned that if the appellant did not put clothes on there wa a very real likelihood of him causing fear and alarm to other member of the public he continued the position of the appellant is somewhat difficult to understand he made it clear to the two police officer that he had no intention whatsoever of putting clothes on he insisted on being naked in a public place he believed that he wa doing no wrong by being naked in a public place he did not accept that he had committed an offence he noted that in questioning the police officer the applicant had chosen not to differentiate between private and public place when it came to nakedness he concluded i wa entirely satisfied that the conduct of the appellant with the aggravation of his refusal to wear clothing in a public place amounted to a breach of the peace the criterion for a breach of the peace a discussed in the case of smith v donnelly had been met the evidence of the appellant did not raise a doubt in my mind accordingly i convicted the appellant a libelled at sentencing the sheriff had before him the applicant previous conviction according to the stated case the applicant confirmed to the sheriff that all previous conviction were for breach of the peace the sheriff stated case continued he acknowledged that he had spent the last five year or thereby in prison for the same offence a pattern ha emerged namely that on his release from prison when he stepped out of the prison gate always naked he wa immediately arrested i asked the appellant what he wa hoping to achieve by insisting on being naked in public he talked about his belief i simply could not understand what he had to say in this regard he did not appear to be waging any campaign or making a protest he informed me that he would rather not be in prison if he wa not in prison he would go back to live with his mother in a village in cornwall he had previously worked a a driver of large good vehicle the sheriff discussed sentencing option with the applicant in his stated case he explained i enquired of him if i wa minded to defer sentence for whatever reason and admit him to a bail order would he then wear clothes after some thought the appellant stated that he would not be prepared to wear clothes the sheriff stated case concluded taking all these matter into account i could see no alternative to a custodial sentence in view of the content of the notice of previous conviction i deemed it appropriate to impose the maximum of month imprisonment which i backdated to the date that he had been taken into custody a further four month imprisonment to run concurrently wa imposed for contempt of courtc the appeal the applicant sought to appeal his conviction and sentence by way of note of appeal and a draft stated case wa prepared by the sheriff in september the applicant wa provided with a copy of the stated case and wa asked for detail of any proposed change by letter of october the applicant proposed a number of change on october a hearing wa held to consider the proposed adjustment to the case stated the applicant wa brought from hmp perth to attend the hearing and blanket were provided to facilitate his attendance he wa told that if he refused to wear clothes or make use of the blanket he would not be admitted into the court he refused to wear clothes or to make use of the blanket and wa accordingly not permitted to attend the adjustment hearing the hearing proceeded in his absence and his requested adjustment were considered by the sheriff two adjustment were allowed and the remaining adjustment rejected concerned that the stated case wa biased the applicant did not lodge it with the justiciary office on october the expiry of the applicable timelimit for lodging his appeal wa deemed abandoned the applicant spent his sentence in segregation at hmp perth a he refused to wear clothes on december he wa released from prison the december arrest minute after his release on december the applicant wa arrested and charged with breach of the peace for being naked in public he wa detained on remand on january he wa convicted of breach of the peace sentence wa deferred to february for uptodate psychiatric and psychological assessment on february the applicant wa sentenced to a term of twelve month imprisonment plus day unserved from previous sentence he lodged an appeal the outcome of the appeal is not known he wa kept in segregation at hmp perth while in prison because he refused to dress he wa released on october the october arrest minute after his release on october the applicant wa arrested and charged with breach of the peace for being naked in public he wa detained on remand on november he wa found guilty of breach of the peace and contempt of court on november he wa sentenced to day imprisonment in respect of the breach of the peace charge together with day unserved from previous sentence plus day for contempt of court to be served consecutively he wa not kept in segregation while in prison at hmp perth he wa released on july the july arresta the arrest minute after his release on july at around am the applicant wa approached by two police officer on manson terrace a public road leading from hmp perth to edinburgh road the officer suggested that he put on some clothes but he refused to do so he wa arrested him for breach of the peace and detained on remand he appeared in court on july and pleaded not guiltyb the trial proceeding the trial commenced on august the applicant appeared in court naked and wa warned by the sheriff that if he refused to dress or to cover himself he might be held in contempt of court he refused to put on clothesi the evidence the prosecution led evidence of two police officer witness at trial their evidence wa similar to that given at the trial and the applicant crossexamination wa also in similar term and elicited similar response see paragraph above the applicant did not give evidence in his defence he argued that his arrest and trial violated the convention he relied inter alia on article arguing that there wa no reasonable suspicion which would satisfy an objective observer that he had committed an offence article arguing that his arrest wa arbitrary a it wa based on the subjective belief that his nakedness wa offensive article arguing that he had a strong view that there wa nothing indecent about his body and that view wa not being respected article arguing that he ought to have been given the right to express his view that nakedness wa not indecent in the way that he had chosen to do and article arguing that he wa being discriminated against because he had different view from the majority of peopleii the conviction and sentence the sheriff found that the applicant conduct on july wa severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people threatened serious disturbance to the community and presented a genuinely alarming in it context to any reasonable person he therefore convicted the applicant in his stated case prepared in the context of the later appeal proceeding the sheriff referred to the applicant convention argument and continued i should say that none of these argument were developed to any extent and it wa not always easy to see what the applicant full argument wa i came to the conclusion that none of the article suggested by the appellant had been contravened in the procedure a to the conviction handed down he explained in my view there wa no doubt about the fact in this case the question wa whether the conduct amounted to a breach of the peace i wa of the view that the first part of the test wa easily met by the conduct the appellant wa walking along a public street in full view of anyone passing and he wa completely naked with his private part entirely on show such conduct would be severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people especially when it wa being carried out in an ordinary public street it might be different if he had been naked somewhere in private even in a public place which wa remote or where fewer people would be congregated but in or near one of the main street of a busy town his appearance in that state would be alarming the question which wa more troubling wa whether the second part of the test wa met would the conduct cause serious disturbance to the community i came to the conclusion that the context in which the conduct wa taking place being naked in a brazen fashion in the public street with no attempt to cover himself and no obvious explanation or reason for the conduct would cause serious disturbance to the community because of the reaction of ordinary people to his presence in that state in that place that would be particularly so if the community could see that child or vulnerable old people might be present i considered that the test wa met and that the charge wa proved beyond reasonable doubt i therefore found the appellant guilty the applicant wa sentenced to a term of imprisonment of day for the breach of the peace and day for the contempt charge together with day unspent from his previous sentence a total of day the sentence were not backdated and they were to run consecutively the total length of the sentence wa therefore one year nine month and eighteen daysc the appeal the applicant sought to appeal his conviction by way of note of appeal and a draft stated case wa prepared by the sheriff adjustment to the stated case were proposed by both party and a hearing wa held the applicant wa not permitted to attend the hearing since he refused to wear clothes on october the applicant lodged an appeal by way of case stated relying on article and of the convention on november the applicant application for leave to appeal wa considered by the first sift judge leave wa refused for the following reason the appeal is not arguable the sheriff ha carefully explained the reason for arriving at his decision there wa no infringement of the appellant right in term of the european convention on human right on december the applicant wa refused leave on the second sift the judge found that for the reason given by the first sift judge the appeal wa not arguable the applicant wa not kept in segregation while serving his sentence at hmp perth he wa released on july subsequent arrest in scotland on the same day the applicant wa arrested and charged with breach of the peace he wa not held in custody on august a decision wa made to take no further action meanwhile on july he wa arrested on the outskirt of dunfermline and charged with breach of the peace he wa detained on remand and appeared at kirkcaldy sheriff court in august he wa convicted of breach of the peace and detained at hmp edinburgh and hmp kilmarnock he wa kept in segregation during his detention he wa released on october and headed south towards his home in eastleigh b treatment while in prison background factsa medical treatment regarding lump on testicle in april the applicant discovered a lump on his right testicle he wa examined in his cell but wa required to wear clothes for external appointment he refused to dress and subsequently made prison complaint about alleged inadequate medical treatment when they were unsuccessful he referred the complaint to the scottish minister but on august he wa informed that they were not upheld the applicant then contacted the scottish public service ombudsman the ombudsman however he wa advised that his complaint wa not one which the ombudsman could pursue on february he wa told that the lump had goneb visit from family and friend on august the applicant made a prison complaint that he wa not allowed visit he wa told in reply that he wa permitted visit provided that he wa appropriately dressed he referred the complaint to the internal complaint committee icc on september he wa advised on september that the icc had fully endorsed the suggestion that visit be accommodated in the segregation unit he wa told to discus this with the relevant staff and book a visit no visit took place on november the applicant contacted the ombudsman with a complaint that the scottish prison service sps wa unreasonably refusing to enable him to receive visit by letter dated january he wa informed that the ombudsman had not upheld the complaint because according to information from the sps he had been asked to cover his genitalia when walking from a hall where he wa detained to the segregation unit he had refused to do soc general dental and medical treatment on september the applicant made a prison complaint about refusal of dental and general medical treatment over the previous five year while he wa in detention by reply dated september he wa advised that the full range of clinical service were available

prisoner and exercise a noted above the applicant spent much of his detention in segregation even when not in segregation his ability to participate in activity and to associate with other prisoner wa generally limited a long a he remained naked he wa not permitted to access the gym for health and safety reason however effort were made to give him access to book and to explore further work or hobby that could be conducted in his cell throughout his time in segregation the applicant wa reviewed regularly by health care professional on january the applicant complained to the prison authority that he wa not allowed to associate with other prisoner or to exercise by reply dated january he wa told that he wa not being denied association or exercise but had excluded himself from these activity by refusing to wear clothes the applicant referred the complaint to the icc on february but the icc decided that the current arrangement were satisfactory it noted that if the applicant were to wear clothes he would be permitted to associate with other prisoner however his choice to remain naked gave rise to serious concern that he might be the victim of violence or unwarranted comment and the prison had an obligation to ensure his safety in march the applicant complained to the ombudsman that the sps had given an unreasonable explanation for denying him access to association and exercise by reply dated may the ombudsman informed him that his complaint had not been upheld because prison staff had confirmed that if he wore clothes he would be able to associate with other prisoner and exercise attempt to secure legal representation and exemption from court fee the applicant contacted the law society of scotland seeking detail of solicitor in edinburgh experienced in judicial review he received a list containing the name of fourteen firm which he duly contacted none were willing to represent him however a further seven firm were recommended to him he contacted them and wa informed that none were willing to represent him he then contacted the court of session to request information regarding exemption from court fee with a view to commencing judicial review proceeding without legal assistance he wa advised that a he wa a prisoner and not in receipt of any state benefit he wa not eligible for exemption from court fee ii relevant domestic law and practicea criminal offence in scotland breach of the peace the leading case a to what constitutes a breach of the peace under scot law is smith v donnelly slt where the appeal court said the crime of breach of the peace can be committed in a wide variety of circumstance and in many case it is a relatively minor crime it ha therefore been said more than once that a comprehensive definition which would cover all possible circumstance is neither possible nor desirable equally in our view it is neither possible nor desirable to derive a comprehensive definition from a close analysis of the fact of individual case in which it ha been held that a breach of the peace had been committed it is in our view clear that what is required to constitute the crime is conduct severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people and threaten serious disturbance to the community what is required therefore it seems to u is conduct which doe present a genuinely alarming and disturbing in it context to any reasonable person that interpretation is supported by the fact that if there is no evidence of actual alarm the conduct must be flagrant if it is to justify a conviction flagrant is a strong word and the use of that word point to a standard of conduct which would be alarming or seriously disturbing to any reasonable person in the particular circumstance we therefore conclude that the definition of the crime found in the principal authority doe meet the requirement of the convention in her majesty advocate v harris hcjac the appeal court citing smith emphasised that it wa now clear that the crime of breach of the peace involved two element conduct severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people and which threatened serious disturbance to the community the maximum sentence for a breach of the peace depends upon the court in which the offence is tried when prosecuted in summary proceeding in the sheriff court the maximum sentence is a fine of up to five thousand pound sterling or imprisonment of one year breach of bail condition pursuant to section b of the criminal procedure scotland act the act it is an offence to fail without reasonable excuse to comply with any condition imposed on bail section provides that a person guilty of an offence under section is liable to a fine or to imprisonment for up to twelve month contempt of court in hm advocate v air jc contempt of court wa described asconduct which challenge or affront the authority of the court or the supremacy of the law itself every court in scotland ha the inherent power to punish person who are in contempt of it where contempt occurs in the court itself it may be dealt with immediately by the judge without a prior formal charge pursuant to section of the contempt of court act contempt of court in summary proceeding before a sheriff is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to three month b criminal proceeding in scotland the decision to prosecute in scotland the decision whether to

solicitor general there are two form of criminal procedure in scotland the most serious crime are tried under solemn procedure on indictment determination of fact in such case are made by a jury le serious crime are tried under summary procedure by a judge sitting without a jury the determination of the sentence in summary proceeding in summary proceeding the sheriff determines the sentence to be imposed on a person found guilty he is required to take into account a number of consideration including the offender personal circumstance his criminal record or lack thereof the circumstance of the offence the age of the offender if under the absence of any previous custodial sentence any guidance issued by the high court any plea of guilty and any time spent in custody awaiting trial the court may decide that it is sufficient to admonish a person found guilty typically this may be done where the case concern a first offence or is minor or there are other extenuating circumstance the procedure for appeal in summary proceeding section of the act provides for the possibility of lodging an appeal against conviction in summary proceeding section stipulates that leave is required pursuant to section any appeal against conviction must be by way of case stated the presiding judge at the trial must prepare a draft stated case and provide a copy to the appellant the stated case set out the matter competent for review by the high court the fact proved in the case any point of law decided and the reason for the decision party to the proceeding may propose adjustment to the stated case if adjustment are proposed the judge must arrange a date for a hearing for the purpose of considering proposed adjustment once the case stated ha been finalised a copy is sent to the appellant who must lodge it with the clerk of justiciary within one week of receipt if he fails to do so the appeal will be deemed abandoned under section and of the act the decision whether to grant leave to appeal against conviction or sentence is made by a judge of the high court who if he considers that there are arguable ground of appeal must grant leave to appeal and make such comment in writing a he considers appropriate in any other case the judge must refuse leave to appeal and give reason in writing for the refusal c prison rule and direction the prison rule are contained in secondary legislation at the relevant time the rule were set out in the prison and young offender institution scotland rule the prison rule from november the relevant rule were the prison and young offender institution scotland rule the prison rule there is no material difference between the two set of rule in so far a they applied to the applicant the reference below are to the rule rule on segregation rule of the prison rule provided that a prisoner could be removed from association with other prisoner for the purpose of maintaining good order or discipline protecting the interest of any prisoner and ensuring the safety of others pursuant to rule a segregation order had to specify the nature of the removal from association and the reason for making the order segregation wa limited

segregation and to make representation to the scottish minister in respect of any application to extend segregation beyond hour rule provided that the prison governor wa obliged to cancel a segregation order if he wa advised by a medical officer that it wa appropriate to do so on health or welfare ground pursuant to rule where a prisoner wa removed from association a medical officer wa

comparative law material the court requested the party to provide comparative information concerning the approach of other member state of the council of europe to nudity in public the government submitted information on the law and practice in nineteen of the fortysix other member state it appears from the data provided that of the nineteen state surveyed only the netherlands expressly criminalises public nudity it is punishable by the imposition of an administrative fine other state andorra belgium france germany and switzerland appear to penalise exhibitionism but the term is rarely defined it seems that sanction vary but the data provided in this respect are incomplete according to the data a number of state have some form of public decency public order or public peace legislation that might extend to prohibiting public nudity belgium croatia the czech republic denmark estonia germany greece italy lithuania the netherlands san marino poland romania russia slovenia sweden and switzerland while sentencing information ha not been provided for some of the state denmark estonia and russia it appears that sentencing power generally vary from the imposition of fine only the czech republic germany slovenia sweden and switzerland to the possibility of imprisonment belgium croatia greece italy lithuania the netherlands poland romania and san marino the lawi the applicant repeated arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment the applicant complained about his repeated arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment for being naked in public in his first letter he invoked article and of the convention a well a article and of protocol no a compliance with article the party submissionsa the government the government alleged that in respect of this complaint the applicant had failed to comply with article which provides the court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedy have been exhausted according to the generally recognised rule of international law and within a period of six month from the date on which the final decision wa taken first the government argued that each arrest and conviction wa a separate incident which could not be viewed a a continuing situation they emphasised that there wa no policy on the part of the police or the prosecuting authority a regard public nudity and their response to the applicant repetition of discrete instance of criminal conduct did not make that conduct continuing they noted that in his first letter the applicant had complained about his june arrest and subsequent conviction only although he had later referred to his july arrest and subsequent conviction the government were of the view that he had not specifically complained about that arrest and conviction they therefore contended that the complaint had been lodged outside the sixmonth timelimit stipulated in article of the convention second the government argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedy while he had initiated an appeal by stated case he had abandoned it on the unsupported allegation that the stated case wa biased according to the government this wa not a credible or acceptable basis to decline to bring his conviction under review by the competent domestic courtb the applicant the applicant reiterated that he had been repeatedly prosecuted and punished for public nudity and did not accept that his complaint had been lodged out of time relying on mc feeley and others v the united kingdom no commission decision of may decision and report dr p he maintained that his case concerned a permanent state of affair which wa still continuing and that the question of the sixmonth rule could only arise after the state of affair had ceased he further maintained that he had exhausted all domestic remedy available to him he had appealed his august conviction by case stated invoking argument under the convention and wa refused leave to appeal at the first and second sifts in december there wa no further avenue of appeal under scot law in these circumstance there wa no prospect of obtaining damage the court assessmenta the sixmonth rule the object of the sixmonth timelimit under article is to promote legal certainty by ensuring that case raising issue under the convention are dealt with in a reasonable time and that past decision are not continually open to challenge a a rule the sixmonth period run from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedy however it ha been said that the sixmonth timelimit doe not apply a such to continuing situation because if there is a situation of ongoing breach the timelimit in effect start afresh each day and it is only once the situation cease that the final period of six month will run to it end chiragov and others v armenia gc dec no december in the present case each arrest with the ensuing prosecution conviction and sentence of imprisonment wa a discrete incident which followed directly upon the applicant appearance naked in public on different occasion a the government pointed out and a is evident from the fact a outlined the applicant ha enjoyed period of liberty between his period of detention even if sometimes only for a few minute accordingly while the cycle of release and rearrest can be said to constitute a pattern it can not be viewed a a continuing situation within the meaning of the court caselaw compare and contrast mc feeley and others cited above the sixmonth period therefore began to run in respect of each conviction from the date of the final domestic decision in the case in his first letter to the court dated july the applicant complained about his arrest in june his subsequent conviction and the appeal proceeding his appeal in respect of that conviction wa abandoned on october had his complaint been directed solely at that conviction it would have been lodged outside the sixmonth timeperiod allowed by article however in his subsequent application form dated december he complained that his repeated conviction and imprisonment for the offence of breach of the peace owing to his refusal to wear clothes in public amounted to a violation of the convention he set out detail of his arrest on july and conviction on august with reference to his pending appeal the court is therefore satisfied that he also complained about his arrest and conviction in the wider context of a pattern of prosecution and conviction for being naked in public leave to appeal in respect of the july conviction wa refused on december the applicant having first notified the court of this complaint on december he ha therefore complied with the sixmonth timelimit in this respectb nonexhaustion of domestic remedy it is primordial that the machinery of protection established by the convention is subsidiary to the national system safeguarding human right this court is concerned with the supervision of the implementation by contracting state of their obligation under the convention it can not and must not usurp the role of contracting state whose responsibility it is to ensure that the fundamental right and freedom enshrined therein are respected and protected on a domestic level the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedy is therefore an indispensable part of the functioning of this system of protection state are dispensed from answering before an international body for their act before they have had an opportunity to put matter right through their own legal system and those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the court a concern complaint against a state are thus obliged to use first the remedy provided by the national legal system see amongst many authority akdivar and others v turkey september report of judgment and decision iv and blatchford v the united kingdom dec no june a stipulated in it akdivar judgment cited above normal recourse should be had by an applicant to remedy which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breach alleged the existence of the remedy in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness a the court also held in akdivar cited above in the area of the exhaustion of domestic remedy there is a distribution of the burden of proof it is incumbent on the government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the court that the remedy wa an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time that is to say that it wa accessible wa one which wa capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant complaint and offered reasonable prospect of success however once this burden of proof ha been satisfied it fall to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the government wa in fact exhausted or wa for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstance of the case or that there existed special circumstance absolving him or her from the requirement finally the application of the rule must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human right that the contracting party have agreed to set up and that it must therefore be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism see akdivar cited above it is apparent that the applicant sought to appeal his conviction by way of case stated see paragraph above in his appeal he invoked article and of the convention permission to appeal wa refused on the second sift on december see paragraph above the applicant ha accordingly exhausted available domestic remedy in respect of his complaintc conclusion on compliance with article of the convention in conclusion the applicant ha satisfied the requirement of article of the convention in respect of his complaint about his arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment a one incident in a pattern of arrest prosecution and conviction over a number of year which wa continuing at the time that he lodged his application the relevance of this broader context will be discussed further in the examination of the admissibility and merit of his individual complaint below b the alleged violation of article and of the convention a noted above in his first letter the applicant invoked article guaranteeing the right to liberty and security and prohibiting punishment without law in respect of his repeated arrest prosecution conviction and sentence without providing further detail of the precise nature of the complaint he did not reiterate these complaint in the application form subsequently lodged by his solicitor although the court sought written observation on the complaint under these article from the party the applicant did not subsequently make any relevant written submission the applicant who wa legally represented chose not to pursue the complaint either in his application form or in his written submission in the circumstance the court see no reason to examine the complaint c the alleged violation of article of the convention article of the convention provides everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary scope of the complaint a noted above while citing two particular instance of arrest and conviction the applicant clearly complained about his repeated arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment for the offence of breach of the peace owing to his refusal to wear clothes in public although the court ha concluded that this did not amount to a continuing situation for the purpose of the sixmonth rule in article of the convention it did accept that the incident formed part of a pattern of arrest prosecution conviction and sentence of imprisonment for being naked in public see paragraph above it would be artificial to ignore this wider pattern when considering the compliance of the measure with the applicant article right since it is precisely their repeated nature which ha led to the applicant detention for a number of year the court will therefore examine the compatibility of the applicant arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment with article of the convention in the light of the pattern of prior and subsequent such incident applicability of article and the admissibility of the complaint the applicant argued that public nudity wa a clear form of expression within the meaning of article of the convention the term expression had been widely construed by the court to cover various different form of expression including expression in word in picture by video and through conduct intended to convey an idea or information in his case the decision not to wear clothes wa a direct expression of his principled view on the human body his complaint therefore fell within the scope of article of the convention the government responded that there had been no restriction placed on the applicant in this regard and that he wa free to advocate his view they did not accept that wearing no clothes constituted freedom of expression or that the requirement to wear clothes in certain context prevented freedom of expression the protection of article extends not only to the substance of the idea and information expressed but also to the form in which they are conveyed jersild v denmark september series a no the court accepts that the right to freedom of expression may include the right for a person to express his idea through his mode of dress or his conduct see respectively stevens v the united kingdom no commission decision of march dr p and kara v the united kingdom no commission decision of october unreported and smith and grady v the united kingdom dec no and february in donaldson v the united kingdom dec no january it found that the applicant decision to wear an easter lily a symbol to commemorate the irish republican combatant who died during or were executed after the easter rising in ireland had to be regarded a a way of expressing his political view see also vajnai v hungary no echr in steel and others v the united kingdom september report vii the court held that protest which took the form of physically impeding the activity of which the applicant disapproved constituted expression of opinion within the meaning of article see also hashman and harrup v the united kingdom gc no echr viii in the present case the applicant ha chosen to be naked in public in order to give expression to his opinion a to the inoffensive nature of the human body see paragraph and above the court is therefore satisfied that the applicant public nudity can be seen a a form of expression which fall within the ambit of article of the convention and that his arrest prosecution conviction and detention constituted repressive measure taken in reaction to that form of expression of his opinion by the applicant there ha therefore been an interference with his exercise of his right to freedom of expression in view of the submission of the party the court considers that the complaint raise complex and serious issue under article of the convention which can not be dismissed a manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article of the convention no other ground for declaring it inadmissible ha been established and it must therefore be declared admissible merit of the complaint an interference with the right to freedom of expression can only be justified under article if it is prescribed by law pursues one of more of the legitimate aim to which article refers and is necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve any such aima prescribed by lawi the party submission the applicant argued his criminal prosecution for public nudity wa not prescribed by law he did not expand upon this submission the government contended that the interference wa prescribed by law they noted that the various measure were taken on the basis of domestic law it wa not the role of this court to consider whether the domestic law had been correctly applied to the applicant and whether he had been correctly convictedii the court assessment the applicant failed in the context of his written submission under article to explain the nature of his challenge to the legality of the measure taken against him having regard to the court finding in lucas v the united kingdom dec no march that the definition of the offence of breach of the peace a stipulated in smith v donnelly see paragraph above wa sufficiently precise to provide reasonable foreseeability of the action which might fall within the remit of the offence the court is satisfied that the interference in the present case both had a sufficient legal basis in domestic law and wa prescribed by law in the wider sense of having the quality required of law in a democratic societyb in pursuit of a legitimate aimi the party submission the applicant contended that his arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment were not in pursuit of any of the stated aim listed in article he did not elaborate on this submission the government argued that the measure pursued the aim of preventing disorder and crime by preventing breach of the peace in publicii the court assessment having regard to all the circumstance surrounding the action of the applicant and the police the court accepts that the measure aimed to prevent disorder and crime however the party did not make detailed submission identifying more clearly the precise nature of the disorder and crime which the measure were taken to prevent it is clear that in a straightforward sense the measure were designed to prevent the applicant committing breach of the peace through causing offence to and alarming other member of the public by confronting them with his naked state in public however the applicant arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment can be seen to have pursued the broader aim of seeking to ensure respect for the law in general and thereby preventing the crime and disorder which would potentially ensue were the applicant permitted to continually and persistently flout the law with impunity because of his own personal albeit sincerely held opinion on nudityc necessary in a democratic societyi the party submissionsα the applicant the applicant argued that there wa no pressing social need to justify the restriction on public nudity or that if there wa such restriction were not proportionate to that need in the applicant view the response of other council of europe state to public nudity see paragraph above reinforced his submission a to the disproportionality of his repeated arrest and imprisonment in the absence of any suggestion that he intended to cause harassment or disturbance to the public a significant majority of state either did not treat public nudity a a criminal offence or treated it a a minor misdemeanour susceptible to a fine or a short period of imprisonment this wa to be contrasted with his situation where he had served almost seven year in prison for public nudity following a pattern of arrest prosecution conviction imprisonment release and immediate rearrest he therefore invited the court to find a violation of article of the conventionβ the government the government argued that defining the scope of the crime of breach of the peace wa peculiarly sensitive to the more of individual state a regard the response of other state to public nudity they emphasised that the period which the applicant had spent in prison wa not the result of a oneoff offence attracting a response by the authority which wa out of step with other council of europe state oneoff offence of the nature at issue in the present case also attracted minor response from the prosecuting authority in the united kingdom the applicant imprisonment on the other hand arose from his repeat offending in an area of criminal policy where there wa a divergence of view among the council of europe member state such a in the present case a particularly wide margin of appreciation applied the government maintained that any interference wa justified and proportionate it wa confined to preventing certain conduct by reason of it adverse impact or potentially adverse impact on others and on the public order in a public context they further emphasised that any person who exercised freedom of expression undertook duty and responsibility that included the obligation to avoid expression which were offensive to others and which did not contribute to any form of public debate capable of furthering progress in human affair the government were of the view that the applicant had failed to act consistently with this principle finally they pointed out that the applicant wa not tried for every offence alleged that not every trial resulted in a conviction and that not every conviction resulted in a term of imprisonment a far a the fortytwo offence for which he wa arrested in scotland in the nineyear period between july and july were concerned the crown decided not to initiate proceeding in respect of twelve the applicant wa acquitted in respect of three offence on a finding of not guilty on the acceptance of a no case to answer submission and on the acceptance of a not guilty plea respectively in respect of the remaining twentyseven offence of which he wa convicted the applicant wa admonished on three occasion a term of imprisonment of three month had only been imposed after the seventh occurrence of a breach of the peace it wa also relevant that the sheriff had specifically raised the possibility of a deferred sentence with the applicant following his conviction in july if he agreed to wear clothes but the applicant had refused to agree see paragraph aboveii the court assessmentα general principle freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society see handyside v the united kingdom december series a no donaldson cited above animal defender international v the united kingdom gc no echr extract this freedom is subject to exception pursuant to article which must be construed strictly the need for any restriction must be established convincingly the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article see mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no july and animal defender international cited above the breadth of the margin of appreciation to be afforded depends on a number of factor the national authority enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in matter of moral since there is no uniform european conception of moral accordingly state authority are in principle better placed than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of the requirement of moral a well a on the necessity of measure intended to meet them see handyside cited above and open door and dublin well woman v ireland october series a no a a narrow margin of appreciation applies in respect of debate on question of public interest and the freedom of expression enjoyed by the press when exercising it vital role a a public watchdog animal defender international cited above while they do not benefit from the special protection afforded to the press even small and informal campaign group must be able to carry on their activity effectively there exists a strong public interest in enabling such group and individual outside the mainstream to contribute to the public debate by disseminating information and idea on matter of general public interest such a health and the environment steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii and mutatis mutandis bowman v the united kingdom february report i it must also be borne in mind that by virtue of the express term of paragraph of article whoever exercise his freedom of expression undertakes duty and responsibility the scope of which depends on his situation and the technical mean he us these duty and responsibility must be taken into account in the court assessment of the necessity of the measure see handyside cited above and hachette filipacchi associés v france no june the court ha previously found that in the context of religious opinion and belief such duty and responsibility may include an obligation to avoid a far a possible expression that are gratuitously offensive to others and thus an infringement of their right and which therefore do not contribute to any form of public debate capable of furthering progress in human affair this being so it said it may be considered necessary in certain democratic society to sanction or even prevent improper attack on object of religious veneration provided always that the penalty imposed be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued see otto preminger institut v austria september series a no a however although individual interest must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group democracy doe not simply mean that the view of a majority must always prevail a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of people from minority and avoids any abuse of a dominant position see chassagnou and others v france gc no and echr iii leyla şahin gc cited above and bayatyan v armenia gc no july pluralism and democracy must be based on dialogue and a spirit of compromise necessarily entailing various concession on the part of individual or group of individual which are justified in order to maintain and promote the ideal and value of a democratic society see leyla şahin gc cited above and tănase v moldova gc no echr respect by the state of the view of a minority by tolerating conduct which is not per se incompatible with the value of a democratic society or wholly outside the norm of conduct of such a society far from creating unjust inequality or discrimination ensures cohesive and stable pluralism and promotes harmony and tolerance in society see mutatis mutandis bayatyan cited above finally in assessing the proportionality of a restriction on freedom of expression the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are factor to be taken into account see ceylan v turkey gc no echr iv tammer v estonia no echr i and skałka v poland no may the court will in light of all of the above consideration ass whether the reason relied on by the competent national authority notably the court to justify the measure were both relevant and sufficient and whether the resultant interference wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued in this respect the court reiterates that it is not it task to take the place of the national authority but it must review in the light of the case a a whole those authority decision taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation animal defender international cited above in conducting it review the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and that they based their decision on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see donaldson cited above β application of the general principle to the fact of the case the present case concern the applicant arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment for the offence of breach of the peace on account of his appearing naked in public in the context of a pattern of previous such measure the court is prepared to accept that the extent to which and the circumstance in which public nudity is acceptable in a modern society is a matter of public interest the fact that the applicant view on public nudity are shared by very few people is not of itself conclusive of the issue now before the court see mutatis mutandis young james and webster v the united kingdom august series a no a an individual intent on achieving greater acceptance of public nudity the applicant is entitled to seek to initiate such a debate and there is a public interest in allowing him to do so however the issue of public nudity also raise moral and publicorder consideration the comparative data supplied by the government show that even in the small number of state surveyed the response of the law and of the authority to public nudity are far from uniform in these circumstance the applicable margin of appreciation in reacting to instance of public nudity a opposed to regulating mere statement or argument on the subject is a wide one turning to examine the approach to manifestation of public nudity in scotland the police and the crown office had discretion in deciding how to respond to such incident a demonstrated by the applicant own case the measure taken against him were not the result of any blanket prohibition each incident wa considered on it fact and in light of the applicant own history of offending following his early arrest he wa generally released with no further action being pursued see paragraph to above on the occasion when he wa prosecuted the court demonstrated a similarly individualised approach the applicant wa only convicted after it had established at trial on the basis of evidence a to his conduct in a particularly public place that the offence of breach of the peace had been made out namely that he had caused alarm to other people and serious disturbance to the community see paragraph above on one occasion the sheriff found on the prosecution evidence that there wa no case to answer and three time the applicant wa found not guilty either following acceptance of a not guilty plea or after a trial of the fact see paragraph and above following the applicant trial at which he also appeared naked see paragraph above the sheriff wa satisfied that the applicant appearance naked on a public road outside hmp perth wa sufficiently severe to cause alarm to ordinary people and serious disturbance to the community see paragraph above although the applicant could have avoided arrest outside hmp perth by complying with the police officer request that he put on clothes he refused to do so see paragraph above the sheriff commented that had the applicant appeared naked in a more remote place or in a place where fewer people would be congregated rather than in or near one of the main street of a busy town he might have reached a different conclusion see paragraph above a to the severity of the sanction it is noteworthy that after his early conviction the applicant wa either admonished see paragraph above or received short sentence of imprisonment of between two week and three month see for example paragraph and above it wa only after a number of conviction for public nudity that the court began to impose more substantial custodial sentence on the applicant even then effort were made to reach a le severe penalty when sentencing the applicant for breach of the peace in the sheriff explored the possibility of a noncustodial sentence if the applicant would agree to wear clothes and only imposed a oneyear sentence when the applicant refused to accept a condition of remaining clothed see paragraph above by the time of his conviction and sentence of day together with a requirement to serve in addition day outstanding for a previous sentence see paragraph above he had been arrested over thirty time for public nudity and convicted almost twenty time in assessing the proportionality of the penalty imposed the court is therefore not concerned with the respondent state response to an individual incident of public nudity but with it response to the applicant persistent public nudity and his wilful and contumacious refusal to obey the law over a number of year see for example the sheriff comment a to sentence in respect of the june conviction at paragraph above it is true that by the time that the sentence wa imposed the applicant had already served a cumulative total of five year and three month in detention since may on remand pending fifteen criminal prosecution and postconviction pursuant to twelve sentence of imprisonment with only four day spent at liberty during that period at the point at which he subsequently left scotland on october he had spent almost six and a half consecutive year in prison with le than a dozen day at liberty throughout the entire period the cumulative period of imprisonment in scotland since for the repeated instance of his refusal to dress in public stand at over seven year while the penalty imposed for each individual offence taken on it own is not such a to raise an issue under article in term of lack of proportionality the cumulative impact on the applicant of the measure taken by the respondent state which wa undeniably severe is otherwise however the applicant own responsibility for the conviction and the sentence imposed can not be ignored in exercising his right to freedom of expression he wa in principle under a general duty to respect the country law and to pursue his desire to bring about legislative or societal change in accordance with them see mutatis mutandis tănase cited above many other avenue for the expression of his opinion on nudity or for initiating a public debate on the subject were open to the applicant he wa also under a duty particularly in light of the fact that he wa asking for tolerance in respect of his own conduct to demonstrate tolerance of and sensibility to the view of other member of the public however the applicant appears to reject any suggestion that acceptance of public nudity may vary depending on the nature of the location and the presence of other member of the public without any demonstration of sensibility to the view of others and the behaviour that they might consider offensive he insists upon his right to appear naked at all time and in all place including in the court in the communal area of prison and on aeroplane see for example paragraph and above the applicant case is troubling since his intransigence ha led to his spending a substantial period of time in prison for what is in itself usually a relatively trivial offence see paragraph above however the applicant imprisonment is the consequence of his repeated violation of the criminal law in full knowledge of the consequence through conduct which he knew full well not only go against the standard of accepted public behaviour in any modern democratic society but also is liable to be alarming and morally and otherwise offensive to other unwarned member of the public going about their ordinary business having regard to the consideration set out above and to the wide margin of appreciation the court find that the reason for the measure adopted by the police the prosecuting authority and the court and in particular those adopted in respect of his arrest in were relevant and sufficient and that the measure met a pressing social need in response to repeated antisocial conduct by the applicant it can not be said that the repressive measure taken in reaction to the particular repeated form of expression chosen by the applicant to communicate his opinion on nudity were even if considered cumulatively disproportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued namely the prevention of disorder and crime in particular article doe not go so far a to enable individual even those sincerely convinced of the virtue of their own belief to repeatedly impose their antisocial conduct on other unwilling member of society and then to claim a disproportionate interference with the exercise of their freedom of expression when the state in the performance of it duty to protect the public from public nuisance enforces the law in respect of such deliberately repetitive antisocial conduct even though cumulatively the penalty imposed on the applicant undoubtedly did entail serious consequence for him the court can not find in the circumstance of his case having regard in particular to his own responsibility for his plight that the public authority in scotland unjustifiably interfered with his exercise of freedom of expression accordingly no violation of article of the convention ha been established d the alleged violation of article of the convention article of the convention provides everyone ha the right to respect for his private and family life his home and his correspondence there shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such a is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral or for the protection of the right and freedom of others the party submission the applicant contended that restriction pertaining to a person mode of personal presentation were a function of personal identity and an exercise of personal autonomy a such any restriction or the imposition of sanction to compel a particular mode of personal presentation constituted an interference with the right to respect for private life he argued that his criminal prosecution for public nudity wa not in accordance with the law and that his arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment were not in pursuit of any of the stated aim listed in article he did not elaborate on these submission relying on his submission in respect of article he invited the court to find a violation of article of the convention the government argued that the right guaranteed by article did not extend to matter concerning personal appearance nor did they extend to act done publicly or in a sense done for a public purpose they emphasised that article did not cover every opportunity to establish and develop relationship citing friend and others v the united kingdom dec no november they further contended that article did not have the effect of protecting conduct which would otherwise be considered criminal accordingly they concluded that the criminal law of breach of the peace did not impinge on the sphere private to the applicant in the event that article wa found to be applicable the government contended that the interference wa in accordance with the law and pursued the aim of prevention of breach of the peace or of crime and disorder and the protection of the applicant they maintained that the measure taken against the applicant were both necessary and proportionate and referred again to the wide margin of appreciation applicable in the field of moral the court assessment the concept of private life is broad in scope and not susceptible of exhaustive definition in general term it secures to the individual a sphere within which he can freely pursue the development and fulfilment of his personality see sidabras and džiautas v lithuania no and echr viii and shtukaturov v russia no echr in sa v france gc no july the grand chamber stated that personal choice a to an individual desired appearance whether in public or in private place relate to the expression of his personality and thus fall within the notion of private life the notion of private life also protects a right to identity and to establish and develop relationship with other human being and the outside world there is therefore a zone of interaction of a person with others even in a public context which may fall within the scope of private life see pg and jh v the united kingdom no echr ix peck v the united kingdom no echr i perry v the united kingdom no echr ix extract and gillan and quinton v the united kingdom no echr extract on the other hand not every activity that a person might seek to engage in with other human being in order to establish and develop relationship will be protected by article it will not for example protect interpersonal relation of such broad and indeterminate scope that there can be no conceivable direct link between the action or inaction of a state and a person private life see friend and others cited above however the fact that behaviour is prohibited by the criminal law is not sufficient to bring it outside the scope of private life see adt v the united kingdom no echr ix and pay v the united kingdom dec no september finally the notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of the guarantee afforded by article see pretty v the united kingdom no echr iii and gillan and quinton cited above the applicant by deliberately and consistently appearing naked in very public place such a urban centre courtroom and the communal part of prison wa intent on making a public statement of his belief in the inoffensive nature of the human body the court ha found that his conduct amounted to a form of expression protected by article see paragraph it ha previously indicated that a distinction must be drawn between carrying out an activity for personal fulfilment and carrying out the same activity for a public purpose where one can not be said to be acting for personal fulfilment alone see friend and others cited above furthermore a concern in particular an individual personal choice a to his desired appearance in public a referred to in sa cited above on analogy with the applicability of article of the convention to religious belief text of article cited below at paragraph article can not be taken to protect every conceivable personal choice in that domain there must presumably be a de minimis level of seriousness a to the choice of desired appearance in question see mutatis mutandis in relation to article bayatyan cited above and eweida and others v the united kingdom no echr extract whether the requisite level of seriousness ha been reached in relation to the applicant choice to appear fully naked on all occasion in all public place without distinction may be doubted having regard to the absence of support for such a choice in any known democratic society in the world in any event however even if article were to be taken to be applicable to the circumstance of the present case the court is satisfied that those circumstance are not such a to disclose a violation of that provision on the part of the public authority in scotland in sum any interference with the applicant right to respect for his private life wa justified under article for essentially the same reason given by the court in the context of it analysis of the applicant complaint under article of the convention see paragraph above e the alleged violation of article of the convention article of the convention provides everyone ha the right to freedom of thought conscience and religion this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom either alone or in community with others and in public or private to manifest his religion or belief in worship teaching practice and observance freedom to manifest one religion or belief shall be subject only to such limitation a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of public safety for the protection of public order health or moral or for the protection of the right and freedom of others the applicant made no submission on the applicability of article of the convention the government noted that the applicant had not elaborated on his claim under article of the convention and contended in particular that he had not presented his view a a belief which attracted article protection they challenged whether his view satisfied the requirement of cogency and seriousness even if there wa a belief there wa no manifestation attracting the protection of article the applicant failed to make submission a to the applicability of article to the case on the basis of the material before it the court find that he ha not shown that his belief met the necessary requirement of cogency seriousness cohesion and importance to fall within the scope of article of the convention see bayatyan cited above and eweida and others cited above this complaint must accordingly be declared inadmissible a incompatible ratione materiae with the provision of the convention pursuant to article a and f other complaint the applicant also complained under article c that he wa not permitted to attend an adjustment hearing in respect of his stated case in october he further invoked article and and article and of protocol no on may he invoked for the first time article arguing that the sentence imposed on him were individually and cumulatively grossly disproportionate having regard to all the material in it possession and in so far a these complaint fall within the court competence it find that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the right and freedom set out in the convention or it protocol it follows that this part of the application must be rejected a manifestly illfounded pursuant to article a and of the convention ii treatment in detention the applicant complained of a violation of article and a a result of his treatment while in detention referring to i the failure to provide dental and optical treatment ii the failure to provide medical treatment regarding a lump on his testicle iii his segregation from other prisoner and the failure to allow him to exercise and iv the denial of visit from family and friend a compliance with article of the convention the party submissionsa the government the government contested the admissibility of the applicant complaint concerning his treatment in detention they contended that he had on april impermissibly extended his original complaint to include matter relating to his detention they further argued that there wa no evidence of any continuing conduct such a to elide the application of the sixmonth timelimit they argued that there wa no policy on the part of the prison authority a regard the condition of the applicant detention whether in relation to segregation exercise or access to medical treatment this wa borne out by the applicant different experience in different prison and even in the same prison over time the government also submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedy the prison rule embodied and promoted respect for some of the very convention right which the applicant claimed had been breached there wa a clear and accessible internal procedure for making complaint if he remained dissatisfied he could have sought judicial review however at no point did the applicant make a claim for damage in respect of the alleged convention violation either by way of judicial review proceeding or through an ordinary action in the sheriff court there had been successful judicial review action brought by prisoner about the feature of the very regime of segregation to which the applicant wa subjected and about condition of detention judicial review wa a flexible and quick procedure in which the applicant could have advanced all claim for a breach of his convention right and sought damage they considered the applicant reason for not pursuing a judicial review claim see paragraph below not to be credible and argued that he had not done all that could reasonably be expected of him to exhaust domestic remedy the applicant had not been held in total isolation and had enjoyed access to the telephone and to postal service it wa not sufficient that he had made several telephone call he had not indicated that he had sought other source of assistance including contacting the citizen advice bureau or the faculty of advocate free representation unit nor had he suggested that he had made an application for advice and assistance the form of legal assistance available to assist in identifying whether there were ground for legal action or for legal aid in any event they considered that lack of financial mean did not absolve an applicant from making some attempt to take legal proceedingsb the applicant the applicant explained that he had pursued his complaint within the sps internal complaint procedure on numerous occasion he had also applied to the ombudsman more than once his complaint were rejected he had sought legal representation to challenge his detention in judicial review proceeding but wa unable to do so he had contacted solicitor on a list provided to him by the prison authority but wa unsuccessful pursuant to rule on legal advice and assistance to which the government referred the maximum fee for solicitor wa gbp this wa often insufficient to cover the basis expense of a prison visit let alone remuneration for the legal advice provided a for the possibility of commencing judicial review proceeding in person the applicant emphasised that this would have required knowledge of a specialised area of scot administrative law and procedure a well a an ability to sift and analyse document and evidence the applicant a a serving prisoner had limited or no access to the kind of legal administrative or technical resource necessary for this task nor did he have the legal expertise or knowledge required he could not he argued be expected to know all the finer point of judicial proceeding and the absence of legal assistance meant that he wa not in a position to pursue a remedy which might have been theoretically open to him the court assessmenta sixmonth rule by letter dated february the applicant first complained to this court about his treatment while in prison relevant prior complaint had been rejected by the domestic authority le than six month before the date on which he first complained about his condition of detention the applicant ha therefore lodged his complaint within the six month provided for in article of the conventionb nonexhaustion the applicant did not dispute that judicial review proceeding were in principle effective and would have offered reasonable prospect of success in respect of his complaint concerning his treatment in detention the government have therefore satisfied the burden of proof of showing the availability of a remedy which wa an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time see paragraph above the applicant must accordingly establish that judicial review proceeding were inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstance of his case or that there existed special circumstance absolving him or her from the requirement to exhaust see paragraph above the government did not contest the applicant submission that he sought assistance from the law society of scotland and subsequently contacted a number of solicitor all of whom declined to act for him it is therefore clear that the applicant took some step to pursue domestic remedy which were available however it is noteworthy that on september only two month after the applicant had lodged his case with this court while in prison by the submission of a letter of introduction which he had himself prepared bindmans solicitor contacted the court to confirm that they had been recently instructed by the applicant to represent him the applicant ha not explained how he wa successful in obtaining representation for his case before this court having been unsuccessful in obtaining scottish legal assistance for judicial review proceeding in the court of session nor ha he explained why bindmans were unable to arrange for the commencement of judicial review proceeding on his behalf at that time indeed by february when he first informed the court of his complaint about his treatment in detention he had already enjoyed legal representation from bindmans for over four month in the circumstance the court concludes that the applicant ha not discharged the burden upon him to demonstrate that the remedy offered by judicial review wa ineffective or that there were special circumstance which exempted him from pursuing it he ha accordingly failed to exhaust domestic remedy in respect of his complaint about his treatment in detention it must therefore be rejected pursuant to article and for these reason the court unanimously declares the complaint under article and concerning the applicant arrest prosecution conviction and imprisonment admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on october pursuant to rule and of the rule of court fatoş aracıineta ziemele deputy registrar president,,,

the article had the overline nadnaslov war to foreign mercenary and subtitle the authority in serbia must apply the law applicable in the usa and ban the work of ngo which receive million of euro from

the sorosinspired šiptar fascist youth initiative for human right which had received euro in the previous three year for the sole purpose of initiating social conflict in serbia the article further stated that the western ngo in serbia were foreign mercenary working in the interest of their financers which wa often against the interest of serbia which wa why they were traitor the court relied on

mercenary traitor sorosinspired šiptar fascist organisation initiating social conflict in serbia amounted to hate speech and in certain section of society had incited hatred intolerance discrimination

notably that they had been preparing other similar action in order to create general chaos in serbia before the forthcoming election a socalled special war the court found that the editorinchief had intended to depict the activist of youth initiative for human right a enemy and a danger to the republic of serbia and it other citizen and discriminate against them for their political that is

partly in favour of a claimant awarded him compensation and ordered that the judgment be published the name of the respondent party and some part of the article are blacked out it appears from the

financing and organising nonpolitical party protest which were to set belgrade on fire and that the claimant had appeared in the parliament in a yellow vest and had announced that there would be

sudska opomena on january and april the supreme court of cassation issued two judgment kzz and kzz respectively regarding the criminal offence of endangering the safety of others the court held that an important element of the said criminal offence wa that there wa a serious clear and unambiguous threat by an individual a defendant that he or she would attack the life or body of another person the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that the state had not discharged it positive obligation to protect them from the threat and medium campaign against them which had intimidated and dissuaded them from continuing to express their opinion on public matter the relevant part of article read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the party submission the government the government submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust all effective domestic remedy instead of wrongly submitting a criminal complaint a they should have requested publication of their reply or a rectification of the published information if necessary by addressing their complaint to the court b they should have asked the court to establish whether publishing certain information had violated the prohibition of hate speech or the right to dignity and they could have sought the removal or destruction of the medium product c they could have sought compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage for a violation of their honour and reputation under the public information and medium act andor the obligation act d they could have lodged a complaint with the regulatory body for electronic medium indicating a violation of their right to dignity and of the prohibition of hate speech andor e they could have lodged a private claim for the criminal offence of insult see paragraph and above in that order the government referred to the relevant domestic caselaw in this regard see paragraph above a the state provided for a number of effective mechanism for the protection of the applicant freedom of expression there had been no violation of the positive obligation stemming from article and the applicant complaint wa manifestly illfounded the government further submitted that there had been no incitement to violence threat or physical attack against the applicant nor had there been any direct threat in the reader comment published online the applicant comparison of their alleged persecution with the case of the murder of a wellknown belgrade journalist slavko ćuruvija in wa utterly pointless and exaggerated the article published on may had expressed an opinion of it author see paragraph above and the title of the article of june could be considered sensationalist see paragraph above but could not lead to the conclusion that the applicant had been accused of preparing an assassination of the prime minister in any event however the forum to discus this wa not the court but rather the domestic court also the applicant had continued to publicly criticise the ruling party and the highest state official see paragraph above therefore their freedom of expression had been neither violated nor restricted the government agreed with the conclusion of the high public prosecutor and maintained that both the high public prosecutor office and the police had acted efficiently on the applicant criminal complaint a there had been no threat against the applicant there had been no criminal offence of endangering the safety of others either a the latter required a direct clear and unambiguous threat that there would be an attack on another person life or body see paragraph above the government submitted that the applicant claim that the atmosphere in which journalist worked in serbia wa generally negative simply could not stand and that serbia wa making effort to ensure an adequate response to the endangering of the safety of journalist they referred to the european commission annual report in that regard see paragraph above the freedom house and european parliament report contained general comment and conclusion on mediarelated problem in serbia and were thus irrelevant for the outcome in the present case the applicant the applicant contested the government submission and reaffirmed their complaint they submitted that they had not been obliged to make use of the legal remedy proposed by the government a these were mainly civil remedy used in case where there had been primarily a violation of the right to reputation and a such they could not address the violation complained of notably the allegation made had amounted to the spreading of idea and theory advocating hatred discrimination and violence against the applicant and all those who had been supporting the protest in serbia in particular they had been accused of being traitor and extremist who had been planning violent demonstration and revolution and who had wished to destabilise the state and assassinate the prime minister which had been accompanied by their picture also the first applicant had been directly accused of personally cooperating with foreign ambassador and exchanging plan for organising violent protest across serbia these accusation had to be read together with the threat written in the comment below the text a well a the general atmosphere in serbia although harmful to their reputation those accusation had primarily made them fear for their safety if they were to continue their criticism by associating them with foreign agency the applicant had been prevented from enjoying their right to freedom of expression since they had felt threatened they had been persecuted and discriminated against simply because they had had different political view and had not supported certain project a they had feared potential violence they had sought protection from the criminal justice system the aim of such proceeding had not been to repair the damage inflicted on their honour and reputation but rather to put an end to further persecution and punish those responsible for it they submitted that the situation in the country justified their fear and referred to the number of attack registered and the freedom house and eu report on serbia see paragraph above in particular a pattern of retribution against highprofile critic of the government had contributed to an increasingly hostile environment for free expression and open debate both the informer and tv pink were considered progovernment medium and it wa quite common for these medium to lead long smear campaign against those who criticised the government or public official such campaign often represented a call for a kind of physical confrontation with such person especially when they were accused of destabilising the state and institution or when they were linked to foreign agency which sometimes ended with the most tragic consequence they referred to the assassination of slavko ćuruvija and maintained that the article written before his assassination wa often perceived a representing a medium announcement of his murder see paragraph above it wa therefore highly probable that there could be violence and in such situation the national authority had an obligation to carefully ass all the fact and protect the applicant and their freedom of expression however the national authority had not conducted a proper investigation they had not interviewed all the suspect nor considered other potential criminal offence subject to public prosecution such a endangerment of the safety of others or a violation of freedom of speech and public appearance nor addressed the reader comment see paragraph and above in that order by failing to ass all the fact and protect them the authority had sent a message to everyone critical of public official that smear campaign were allowed in serbia smear campaign such a the one in the present case had the aim of causing a chilling effect and preventing their victim that is the applicant from criticising publicly given the whole context the nature of the disputed text and the reader comment the applicant had had reason to fear for their safety which had affected their freedom of expression notably they had stopped openly criticising the said project and procedure because of their fear the fact that they had continued to criticise the authority did not change the fact that their freedom of expression had been endangered during the smear campaign in the medium and for a certain period afterwards the court assessment admissibility the government made an objection of nonexhaustion by referring to several remedy which the applicant should have used the relevant principle a regard the exhaustion of domestic remedy are set out in vučković and others v serbia preliminary objection gc no and others march the court reiterates in particular that if more than one potentially effective remedy is available the applicant is only required to have used one of them see aquilina v malta gc no echr iii the court note in this regard that the applicant made use of a criminallaw remedy which doe not seem to be futile the government objection must therefore be dismissed the court note that the applicant complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merit the court reiterates the key importance of freedom of expression a one of the precondition for a functioning democracy genuine effective exercise of this freedom doe not depend merely on the state duty not to interfere but may require positive measure of protection even in the sphere of relation between individual see özgür gündem v turkey no echr iii appleby and others v the united kingdom no echr vi dink v turkey no and others september palomo sánchez and others v spain gc no and others echr and huseynova v azerbaijan no april in determining whether or not a positive obligation exists regard must be had to the fair balance that ha to be struck between the general interest of the community and the interest of the individual the search for which is inherent throughout the convention the scope of this obligation will inevitably vary having regard to the diversity of situation obtaining in contracting state the difficulty involved in policing modern society and the choice which must be made in term of priority and resource nor must such an obligation be interpreted in such a way a to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authority see özgür gündem cited above in particular the positive obligation under article of the convention require state to create while establishing an effective system for the protection of journalist a favourable environment for participation in public debate by all the person concerned enabling them to express their opinion and idea without fear even if they run counter to those defended by the official authority or by a significant part of public opinion or even if irritating or shocking to the latter see dink and huseynova both cited above see also khadija ismayilova v azerbaijan no and january turning to the present case the court note that the applicant are journalist and civilsector activist who took part in protest criticising the demolition of certain house and installation a largescale construction project in belgrade and the change in the management of a regional radiotelevision station this wa followed by two article published on may and june suggesting that the real organiser and financers of the protest were the european union and the united state of america who wanted to radicalise the protest with the ultimate aim of overthrowing the serbian prime minister and that a number of person from serbia including the applicant were participating in that project the allegation made in this article were repeated on may and and june see paragraph above the applicant submitted that these allegation had made them feel threatened which wa why they had resorted to a criminal complaint they maintained that the national authority had had an obligation to carefully ass all the fact and protect the applicant but they had failed to do so see paragraph above the court note that even though the applicant submitted that they had felt threatened following the publication of the above article and broadcasting of the programme in question none of them ha ever in fact been subjected to any act of violence see mutatis mutandis huseynova cited above contrast khadija ismayilova cited above they brought their concern and fear to the attention of the authority by lodging a criminal complaint for discrimination and a breach of the right to equality against several private individual which wa processed promptly contrast özgür gündem cited above where the domestic authority which were aware of a series of violent action against a newspaper and people associated with it did not take any action to protect the newspaper and it journalist while it is true that the police did not interview all the person against whom the complaint had been made the court note that the factual situation wa more or le undisputed among the party and a decision not to interview all of them in such a situation doe not seem unreasonable or arbitrary on the basis of the information collected the prosecutor rejected the applicant criminal complaint a there were no ground to believe that the person in question had committed any of the alleged criminal offence contrary to the applicant submission the prosecutor also held that there were no ground to believe that any other criminal offence subject to public prosecution had been committed either see paragraph and above the court also note that it is not for it to rule on the constituent element under domestic law of the offence of discrimination and a breach of the right to equality or any other offence for that matter see mutatis mutandis fatullayev v azerbaijan no april and dmitriyevskiy v russia no october it is primarily for the national authority in particular the court to interpret and apply domestic law see de tommaso v italy gc no february the court role is rather to review under article the decision that domestic court deliver pursuant to their power of appreciation in doing so it must satisfy itself that the national authority based their decision on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see kudrevičius and others v lithuania gc no echr and belkacem v belgium dec no june in view of the content of the article and television show in question and that of the applicant criminal complaint the court is not convinced that the decision of the relevant prosecutor wa not based on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact the court observes that the prosecutor went even further suggesting that the allegation in question amounted perhaps to the criminal offence of insult which wa subject to private prosecution the applicant did not however pursue this avenue it is further observed that the national legislation provides for a number of other remedy offering the applicant protection of their freedom of expression had they felt that it had been interfered with these included in particular civil proceeding for a violation of the prohibition of hate speech a well a civil proceeding for claiming compensation requesting a reply to andor rectification of information published and a number of measure pronounced by the regulatory body for electronic medium see paragraph above the government submitted abundant domestic caselaw for each of the remedy in question in all of them the court and the regulatory body ruled in favour of various claimant and ordered that either a reply to or a rectification of information be published found violation of hate speech and ordered the respondent party to publish the judgment in question ordered compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage for a violation of their honour and reputation or their dignity and presumption of innocence caused by untrue andor forbidden information being published about them or issued warning and notice or banned further publishing of the particular content see paragraph above in some of them the respondent party were the same medium company against whose editorsinchief the applicant had lodged their own criminal complaint and in some of them the court dealt with thirdparties comment too see paragraph and above the applicant did not deny that these other remedy were available to them the court also take note of the report on the situation in serbia concerning the freedom of expression and safety of journalist and the report of physical attack and other type of alleged persecution of journalist however given the specific circumstance of the present case the court considers that the prosecutor finding were not arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable and nor did they rely on an unacceptable assessment of the relevant fact it also find that the respondent state offered a number of other effective mean for the protection of the applicant which they have not made use of in view of all of the above the court doe not find that the respondent state failed in their positive obligation to protect the applicant freedom of expression there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimouslydeclares the application admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rule of court hasan bakırcı jon fridrik kjølbro registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the separate opinion of judge koskelo is annexed to this judgment jfkhb concurring opinion of judge koskelo i have joined the majority in concluding that there ha been no violation of article in the present case but i have done so with considerable hesitation i will briefly set out the reason for this the factual background to the case in a nutshell is the following the applicant a journalist and civilsociety activist exercised their freedom of expression and assembly in relation to commonplace matter of general interest see paragraph of the present judgment in the wake of those activity they were targeted on the website of a rightwing movement and in certain progovernment medium with very serious and repeated accusation alleging that the applicant through their association with protest organised under the banner dont let belgrade drown were involved in a foreignled conspiracy by extremist directed against the elected government and aimed at it overthrow or even the assassination of the prime minister the applicant sought in vain to obtain protection by the domestic criminal justice system according to the competent prosecuting authority there wa no ground to believe that any criminal offence which wa subject to public prosecution had been committed they considered that the reported action had had no consequence and entailed no deprivation or restriction of anyones right nor had the publication of the article promoted or incited hatred discrimination or violence against any group based on their religion nationality or other personal characteristic it wa acknowledged that the reported act could perhaps have been classified a an insult which however wa not subject to public prosecution the applicant subsequent constitutional appeal wa rejected it is well known that the court approach ha been critical and restrictive towards the use of criminal remedy in the context of measure by state authority to sanction the exercise of freedom of expression in many situation there are very wellfounded and solid reason to justify that approach indeed there are obvious risk involved in recourse being had to the repressive penal power of the state especially when it come to interference in the exercise of criticism directed at institution or person in position of power that being said any assessment of the act or omission of state authority whether in the field of their negative or positive obligation under the convention must however remain sensitive to the context and adequately differentiated according to the specific circumstance what is at issue in the present case are accusation directed at the applicant by other private actor denouncing and discrediting them on account of the protest activity in which they participated given the very serious nature of the accusation levelled against the applicant and the general context it seems wellfounded to consider a the applicant did that the action they complained of went beyond mere insult indeed it appears that freedom of expression wa employed against the applicant with a view to suppressing their freedom to act and express their opinion thus the present case is not about any chilling effect that might arise from sanction applied against those who engage in criticism it is on the contrary about the chilling effect that risk being created through the failure to impose sanction on those who seek to attack others for the usual exercise of their freedom and who do so not by engaging in an exchange of argument on the subject matter of the issue addressed but through attempt to stigmatise the opponent a traitor and conspirator that is to say enemy of the state instead of treating them a legitimate participant and interlocutor in the normal affair and controversy of society the danger of such aggressive potentially toxic and intimidating smear campaign for the condition and the quality of necessary democratic debate and exchange of argument should not be underestimated after all the ultimate aim of freedom of expression is to enable and to maintain democracy not to undermine it therefore it is indeed very important in the interest of protecting democracy to uphold the positive obligation incumbent on the state party to create by establishing an effective system for the protection of journalist a well a member of civil society a favourable environment for participation in public debate this should enable the expression of opinion and idea without fear even if they may run counter to those defended by the official authority or by a significant part of public opinion see khadija ismayilova v azerbaijan no and january in this context the availability of recourse to various civil remedy alone may not be sufficient especially in term of the necessary dissuasive effect i note for instance that in the domestic civil judgment mentioned in paragraph of the present judgment the award of compensation amounted to serbian dinar equivalent to no more than roughly euro even where outright hate speech is not involved act amounting to intimidation smear campaign or other form of persistent harassment aimed at others because of their normal exercise of freedom under article may reasonably call for a reaction and protection of the victim by the criminal justice system this may be particularly relevant if suppressive action by some actor or group directed at those holding and expressing different view become a more general pattern of behaviour in this regard one must note with concern the information contained in paragraph of the present judgment relating to the general environment of medium freedom and debate in the respondent state in my view the circumstance of the case together with the more general context were of such a nature a to create a heightened duty of scrutiny on the part of the domestic authority in connection with the positive obligation arising for them under article given the very limited and superficial reasoning provided see paragraph of the judgment i remain in doubt a to whether the domestic authority primarily the prosecution service actually conducted a sufficiently thorough assessment of the applicant grievance in particular a regard the offence set out in article of the criminal code a that provision concern an offence which is subject to public prosecution it fell to be considered even if it wa not expressly referred to by the applicant themselves given the inherent limit of the information accessible in the material before u and the necessary caution mandated by the partial view available to u i have voted in favour of finding no violation despite the doubt expressed above,,,
16,the applicant wa born in and life in vienna from january she held several seminar entitled basic information on islam grundlagen de islam at the rightwing freedom party education institute bildungsinstitut der freiheitlichen partei österreichs the seminar were not only open to member of the freedom party or invited guest but were also publicly advertised on it website in addition the

court landesgericht für strafsachen wien the regional court informed the applicant that the court might adopt a different legal classification in the matter from the one contained in the charge the hearing wa therefore postponed to give her time to properly prepare a defence at the end of the hearing on february the regional court acquitted the applicant in relation to several of the statement originally included in the indictment under article of the criminal code this wa partly because the public prosecutor had withdrawn the indictment concerning certain statement and partly because it could not be established that the applicant had made some of the other statement exactly or at least approximately a they were worded in the indictment she wa however convicted of disparaging religious doctrine herabwürdigung religiöser lehren pursuant to article of the criminal code concerning the three remaining statement she wa ordered to pay the cost of the proceeding and a dayfine of euro eur for a period of day amounting to eur in total which would result in sixty day imprisonment in the event of default the court considered the applicant repeated infringement to be an aggravating factor and the fact that she did not have a previous criminal record to be a mitigating factor the court found her guilty of publicly disparaging an object of veneration of a domestic church or religious society namely muhammad the prophet of islam in a manner capable of arousing justified indignation geeignet berechtigtes ärgernis zu erregen the statement which the court found incriminating were the following english translation i one of the biggest problem we are facing today is that muhammad is seen a the ideal man the perfect human the perfect muslim that mean that the highest commandment for a male muslim is to imitate muhammad to live his life this doe not happen according to our social standard and law because he wa a warlord he had many woman to put it like this and liked to do it with child and according to our standard he wa not a perfect human we have huge problem with that today that muslim get into conflict with democracy and our value system the most important of all hadith collection recognised by all legal school the most important is the sahih al bukhari if a hadith wa quoted after bukhari one can be sure that all muslim would recognise it and unfortunately in al bukhari the thing with aisha and child sex is written ii i remember my sister i have said this several time already when sw made her famous statement in graz my sister called me and asked for god sake did you tell sw that to which i answered no it wasnt me but you can look it up it not really a secret and her you cant say it like that and me a yearold and a sixyearold what do you call that give me an example what do we call it if it is not paedophilia her well one ha to paraphrase it say it in a more diplomatic way my sister is symptomatic we have heard that so many time those were different time it wasnt okay back then and it not okay today full stop and it is still happening today one can never approve of something like that they all create their own reality because the truth is so cruel german original i eines der großen probleme die wir heute haben ist das mohammed al der ideale mann der perfekte mensch der perfekte muslim gesehen wird da heißt da oberste gebot für einen männlichen moslem ist e mohammed nachzumachen sein leben zu leben da läuft nicht nach unseren sozialen standard und gesetzen ab weil er war ein kriegsherr hatte einen relativ großen frauenverschleiß um da jetzt einmal so auszudrücken hatte nun mal gerne mit kindern ein bisschen wa und er war nach unseren begriffen kein perfekter mensch damit haben wir heute riesige probleme weil muslime mit der demokratie und unserem wertesystem in konflikt geraten die wichtigsten von allen rechtsschulen anerkannten hadith sammlungen die allerwichtigste ist die sahih al bukhari wenn eine hadith nach bukhari zitiert wurde dann können sie sicher sein das e alle muslime anerkennen und in der al bukhari ist auch blöderweise da geschrieben mit der aisha und dem kindersex ii ich erinnere mich an meine schwester da hab ich schon ein paar mal erzählt al sw in graz ihren berühmten sager gemacht hat ruft mich meine schwester an und sagt um gottes willen hast du ihr da gesagt worauf ich gesagt habe nein ich war nicht aber e ist nachzulesen e ist nicht wirklich ein geheimnis und sie da kann man doch so nicht sagen und ich ein jähriger und eine jährige wie nennst du da gib mir ein beispiel wie nennen wir da wenns nicht pädophilie ist sie na ja da mus man ein bisschen umschreiben diplomatischer sagen meine schwester ist symptomatisch da haben wir schon so oft gehört da waren doch andere zeiten da war damals nicht ok und e ist heute nicht ok punkt und e passiert heute auch noch so wa ist nie gutzuheißen sie legen sich alle eine wirklichkeit zurecht weil die wahrheit so grausam ist the regional court found that the above statement essentially conveyed the message that muhammad had had paedophilic tendency it stated that the applicant wa referring to a marriage which muhammad had concluded with aisha a sixyearold and consummated when she had been nine the court found that by making those statement the applicant had suggested that muhammad wa not a worthy subject of worship however it also found that it could not be established that the applicant had intended to decry all muslim she wa not suggesting that all muslim were paedophile but wa criticising the unreflecting imitation of a role model according to the court the common definition of paedophilia wa a primary sexual interest in child who had not yet reached puberty because paedophilia wa behaviour which wa ostracised by society and outlawed it wa evident that the applicant statement were capable of causing indignation the court concluded that the applicant had intended to wrongfully accuse muhammad of having paedophilic tendency even though criticising child marriage wa justifiable she had accused a subject of religious worship of having a primary sexual interest in childrens body which she had deduced from his marriage with a child disregarding the point that the marriage had continued until the prophet death when aisha had already turned eighteen and had therefore passed the age of puberty in addition the court found that because of the public nature of the seminar which had not been limited to member of the freedom party it wa conceivable that at least some of the participant might have been disturbed by the statement the regional court further stated that anyone who wished to exercise their right under article of the convention wa subject to duty and responsibility such a refraining from making statement which hurt others without reason and therefore did not contribute to a debate of public interest a balancing exercise between the right under article on the one hand and those under article on the other needed to be carried out the court considered that the applicant statement were not statement of fact but derogatory value judgment which exceeded the permissible limit it held that the applicant had not intended to approach the topic in an objective manner but had directly aimed to degrade muhammad the court stated that child marriage were not the same a paedophilia and were not only a phenomenon of islam but also used to be widespread among the european ruling dynasty furthermore the court reasoned that freedom of religion a protected by article of the convention wa one of the foundation of a democratic society those who invoked their freedom of religion could not expect to be exempt from criticism and even had to accept the negation of their belief however the manner in which religious view were attacked could engage the state responsibility in order to guarantee the peaceful exercise of the right under article presenting object of religious worship in a provocative way capable of hurting the feeling of the follower of that religion could be conceived a a malicious violation of the spirit of tolerance which wa one of the base of a democratic society the court concluded that the interference with the applicant freedom of expression in the form of a criminal conviction had been justified a it had been based in law and had been necessary in a democratic society namely in order to protect religious peace in austria the applicant appealed arguing that the impugned statement were statement of fact not value judgment she referred to several of the document which she had submitted a evidence which in her view clearly confirmed that when muhammad had been fiftysix year old he had had sexual intercourse with the nineyearold aisha she stated that it wa no more than reasonable to present those fact in the light of the value of today society it had not been her intention to disparage muhammad she had merely criticised the notion that an adult had had sexual intercourse with a nineyearold child and raised the question whether this amounted to paedophilia if one were to follow the argument of the regional court it would mean that someone who had married a child and managed to maintain the marriage until the child had come of age could not be described a a paedophile she further contended that she had not used the term paedophile in the strict scientific sense but in the way it wa used in everyday language referring to men who had sex with minor she stated that she had never said that muhammad had been a paedophile because he had married a child but because he had had sexual intercourse with one in any event her statement were covered by her right under article of the convention which included the right to impart opinion and idea that offended shocked or disturbed on december the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht wien hereinafter the court of appeal dismissed the applicant appeal confirming in essence the legal and factual finding of the lower court the regional court had based it finding on the fact a submitted by the applicant namely that muhammad had married aisha when she had been six year old and consummated the marriage when she had been nine it had rightly made a distinction between child marriage and paedophilia it had not based it finding on an unpredictable definition of the term paedophilia but on a common definition which wa comparable to that used by the world health organisation a regard the alleged violation of article of the convention the court of appeal referring to the court caselaw i̇a v turkey no echr viii and aydın tatlav v turkey no may found that it had to examine whether the comment at issue were merely provocative or had been intended a an abusive attack on the prophet of islam it concluded that the latter wa the case a muslim would find the applicant statement he liked to do it with child the thing with aisha and child sex and a yearold and a sixyearold what do you call that give me an example what do we call it if it is not paedophilia wrong and offensive even if muhammad had married a sixyearold and had had intercourse with her when she had been nine the court of appeal stated that the reason for the applicant conviction had not been that the event had purportedly taken place more than a thousand year ago and similar conduct would no longer be tolerable under today criminal law and contemporary moral and value concept but because the applicant had accused muhammad of paedophilia by using the plural form child child sex what do we call it if it is not paedophilia without providing evidence that his primary sexual interest in aisha had been her not yet having reached puberty moreover there were no reliable source for that allegation a no documentary evidence existed to suggest that his other wife or concubine had been similarly young on the contrary his first wife had been fifteen year older than him a could be seen from the document submitted by the applicant herself even if the applicant had had the right to criticise others attempt to imitate muhammad her statement showed her intention to unnecessarily disparage and deride muslim harsh criticism of church or religious society religionsgesellschaften and religious tradition and practice wa lawful however the permissible limit were exceeded where criticism ended and insult or mockery of a religious belief or person of worship beschimpfung oder verspottung einer religion oder von ihr verehrten personen began the interference with the applicant freedom under article of the convention had therefore been justified a to the applicant argument that those who had participated in the seminar knew of her critical approach and could not be offended the court of appeal found that the public seminar had been offered for free to young voter by the austrian freedom party education institute and at least one participant had been offended a her complaint had led to the applicant being charged on april the applicant lodged a request for a renewal of the proceeding antrag auf erneuerung de strafverfahrens with the supreme court oberster gerichtshof pursuant to article a of the code of criminal procedure strafprozessordnung and relying on article article and article of the convention on june the applicant lodged her application with the court on december the supreme court dismissed the request for a renewal of the proceeding a regard the alleged violation of article it found that the applicant conviction under article of the criminal code constituted an interference with the right to freedom of expression which had however been justified under article of the convention referring to the court caselaw otto preminger institut v austria september series a no a i̇a cited above wingrove v the united kingdom november report of judgment and decision v aydın tatlav cited above and giniewski v france no echr i it held that the aim of the interference had been to protect religious peace and the religious feeling of others and wa therefore legitimate the court had stated many time that in the context of religion member state had a duty to suppress certain form of conduct or expression that were gratuitously offensive to others and profane in case where the impugned statement not only offended or shocked or expressed a provocative opinion but had also been considered an abusive attack on a religious group for example an abusive attack on the prophet of islam a in the applicant case a criminal conviction might be necessary to protect the freedom of religion of others where a conviction wa based on article of the criminal code the principle developed under article and of the convention had to be considered when examining whether a statement wa capable of arousing justified indignation a statement could not be considered a arousing indignation if it wa compatible with article and of the convention the court therefore had to examine the meaning of the impugned statement a well a the context in which it had been made and whether the statement wa based on fact or wa a value judgment only by considering all of those point could the question of the ability to arouse justified indignation be examined applying the above consideration to the applicant case the supreme court held that she had not aimed to contribute to a serious debate about islam or the phenomenon of child marriage but merely to defame muhammad by accusing him of a specific sexual preference based on the assumption that he had had sexual intercourse with a prepubescent child in order to show that he wa not a worthy subject of worship the court whilst not misjudging the importance of the debate about sexual contact between adult and child found that the applicant had not contributed to a debate of general interest because she had made her allegation primarily in order to defame muhammad on the basis of the regional court finding that the applicant statement qualified a value judgment the supreme court held that they had not been a contribution to a serious debate the case had to be distinguished from the case of aydın tatlav cited above in which a scientific book published in it fifth edition had contained a passage of harsh criticism of religion which had not been offensive in the present case the criminal conviction constituted a measure necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention moreover the measure taken by the criminal court had also been proportionate a the applicant had only been ordered to pay a fine of eur the supreme court therefore dismissed the applicant request for a renewal of the proceeding the supreme court judgment wa served on the applicant counsel on january ii relevant domestic law article of the criminal code is part of section of the criminal code which inter alia list criminally punishable offence against religious peace strafbare handlungen gegen den religiösen frieden it read a follows article disparagement of religious doctrine whoever in circumstance where his or her behaviour is likely to arouse justified indignation publicly disparages or insult a person who or an object which is an object of veneration of a church or religious community established within the country or a dogma a lawful custom or a lawful institution of such a church or religious community shall be liable to up to six month imprisonment or a dayfine for a period of up to day article of the criminal code a in force at the relevant time read a follows article incitement to hatred whoever in a manner capable of endangering public order publicly incites to commit a hostile act against a church or religious community established within the country or against a group defined by it belonging to such a church or religious community a race a nation a tribe or a state shall be liable to up to two year imprisonment similarly whoever publicly incites against a group defined in paragraph or try to insult or disparage it in a manner violating human dignity shall equally be held liable iii international material article of the united nation international covenant on civil and political right provides any advocacy of national racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law the council of europe parliamentary assembly stated in it recommendation on blasphemy religious insult and hate speech against person on ground of their religion with regard to blasphemy religious insult and hate speech against person on the ground of their religion the state is responsible for determining what should count a criminal offence within the limit imposed by the case law of the european court of human right in this connection the assembly considers that blasphemy a an insult to a religion should not be deemed a criminal offence a distinction should be made between matter relating to moral conscience and those relating to what is lawful matter which belong to the public domain and those which belong to the private sphere even though today prosecution in this respect are rare in member state they are legion in other country of the world the assembly note that member state have the obligation under article of the convention to protect freedom of religion including the freedom to manifest one religion this requires that member state protect such manifestation against disturbance by others however these right may sometimes be subject to certain justified limitation the challenge facing the authority is how to strike a fair balance between the interest of individual a member of a religious community in ensuring respect for their right to manifest their religion or their right to education and the general public interest or the right and interest of others the assembly considers that a far a it is necessary in a democratic society in accordance with article paragraph of the convention national law should only penalise expression about religious matter which intentionally and severely disturb public order and call for public violence the european commission for democracy through law the venice commission stated in it report on the relationship between freedom of expression and freedom of religion the issue of regulation and prosecution of blasphemy religious insult and incitement to religious hatred cdlad a concern the question of whether or not there is a need for specific supplementary legislation in the area of blasphemy religious insult and incitement to religious hatred the commission findsa that incitement to hatred including religious hatred should be the object of criminal sanction a is the case in almost all european state b that it is neither necessary nor desirable to create an offence of religious insult that is insult to religious feeling simpliciter without the element of incitement to hatred a an essential componentc that the offence of blasphemy should be abolished which is already the case in most european state and should not be reintroduced a concern the question of to what extent criminal legislation is adequate andor effective for the purpose of bringing about the appropriate balance between the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for one belief the commission reiterates that in it view criminal sanction are only appropriate in respect of incitement to hatred unless public order offence are appropriate notwithstanding the difficulty with enforcement of criminal legislation in this area there is a high symbolic value in the pan european introduction of criminal sanction against incitement to hatred it give strong signal to all part of society and to all society that an effective democracy can not bear behaviour and act which undermine it core value pluralism tolerance respect for human right and nondiscrimination it is essential however that the application of legislation against incitement to hatred be done in a nondiscriminatory manner in the commission view instead criminal sanction are inappropriate in respect of insult to religious feeling and even more so in respect of blasphemy the united nation human right council stated in it resolution combating intolerance negative stereotyping and stigmatization of and discrimination incitement to violence and violence against person based on religion or belief adopted on march the human right council express it concern that incident of religious intolerance discrimination and related violence a well a of negative stereotyping of individual on the basis of religion or belief continue to rise around the world and condemns in this context any advocacy of religious hatred against individual that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence and urge state to take effective measure a set forth in the present resolution consistent with their obligation under international human right law to address and combat such incident note the speech given by secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference at the fifteenth session of the human right council and draw on his call on state to take the following action to foster a domestic environment of religious tolerance peace and respect bye speaking out against intolerance including advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violencef adopting measure to criminalize incitement to imminent violence based on religion or beliefg understanding the need to combat denigration and negative religious stereotyping of person a well a incitement to religious hatred by strategizing and harmonizing action at the local national regional and international level through inter alia education and awarenessbuildingh recognizing that the open constructive and respectful debate of idea a well a interfaith and intercultural dialogue at the local national and international level can play a positive role in combating religious hatred incitement and violence the un human right committee adopted at it nd session july the general comment no on freedom of opinion and freedom of expression freedom of expression is a necessary condition for the realization of the principle of transparency and accountability that are in turn essential for the promotion and protection of human right defamation law must be crafted with care to ensure that they comply with paragraph and that they do not serve in practice to stifle freedom of expression all such law in particular penal defamation law should include such defence a the defence of truth and they should not be applied with regard to those form of expression that are not of their nature subject to verification at least with regard to comment about public figure consideration should be given to avoiding penalizing or otherwise rendering unlawful untrue statement that have been published in error but without malice in any event a public interest in the subject matter of the criticism should be recognized a a defence care should be taken by state party to avoid excessively punitive measure and penalty where relevant state party should place reasonable limit on the requirement for a defendant to reimburse the expense of the successful party state party should consider the decriminalization of defamation and in any case the application of the criminal law should only be countenanced in the most serious of case and imprisonment is never an appropriate penalty it is impermissible for a state party to indict a person for criminal defamation but then not to proceed to trial expeditiously such a practice ha a chilling effect that may unduly restrict the exercise of freedom of expression of the person concerned and others prohibition of display of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system including blasphemy law are incompatible with the covenant except in the specific circumstance envisaged in article paragraph of the covenant thus for instance it would be impermissible for any such law to discriminate in favour of or against one or certain religion or belief system or their adherent over another or religious believer over nonbeliever nor would it be permissible for such prohibition to be used to prevent or punish criticism of religious leader or commentary on religious doctrine and tenet of faith law that penalize the expression of opinion about historical fact are incompatible with the obligation that the covenant imposes on state party in relation to the respect for freedom of opinion and expression the covenant doe not permit general prohibition of expression of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past event restriction on the right of freedom of opinion should never be imposed and with regard to freedom of expression they should not go beyond what is permitted in paragraph or required under article the european parliament in it resolution of february on the situation of fundamental right in the european union ini held that the european parliament recall that national law that criminalise blasphemy restrict freedom of expression concerning religious or other belief that they are often applied to persecute mistreat or intimidate person belonging to religious or other minority and that they can have a serious inhibiting effect on freedom of expression and on freedom of religion or belief recommends that the member state decriminalise such offence the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant alleged that her criminal conviction for disparaging religious doctrine had given rise to a violation of article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court note that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission the applicant considered that her conviction for the abovementioned statement had amounted to an unlawful interference with her right to freedom of expression referring to the court caselaw she considered that the domestic court had failed to address the substance of the impugned statement in the light of article of the convention if they had done so they would not have qualified them a mere value judgment value judgment were only excessive if they were not linked to fact whereas her incriminated statement had been based on fact the applicant stressed that by stating that muhammad had had sexual intercourse with a nineyearold she had quoted a historically proven fact and raised the question whether this could be regarded a paedophilia thus she had based her value judgment on fact which wa always permissible under article of the convention furthermore through the impugned statement she had expressed criticism concerning islam and the unreflecting imitation of muhammad in the framework of an objective and lively discussion which the domestic court had failed to take into account against that background this had been an objective criticism of religion had contributed to a public debate and had not been aimed at defaming the prophet of islam consequently contrary to the domestic court reasoning a sufficient factual basis had existed for her assessment that muhammad behaviour had amounted to paedophilia she added that she had held a seminar extending over a number of day with an overall duration of twelve hour and therefore a few individual statement had to be tolerated in order to allow for a lively discussion which wa a necessary part of such a seminar the applicant further submitted that religious group had to be regarded a public institution and therefore had to tolerate even severe criticism referring inter alia to the court judgment in aydın tatlav giniewski both cited above and gündüz v turkey no echr xi the applicant alleged that improper attack on religious group had to be tolerated even if they were based on untrue fact a long a they did not incite to violence moreover the right guaranteed under article of the convention did not imply a ban on the propagation by others of a doctrine which wa hostile to other people faith only expression that were gratuitously offensive to others and thus an infringement of their right and which therefore did not contribute to any form of public debate should be prohibited by law whereas blasphemy law providing for a criminal sanction should be avoided according to international law standard she contrasted her case with the court judgment in i̇a v turkey cited above a the impugned statement at issue in i̇a had not been linked to fact in relation to the question of the legitimate aim of the applicant criminal conviction the government submitted that article of the criminal code did not prohibit critical or offensive statement about a church or religious community per se but merely regulated the manner in which such statement could be made a the explanatory note on the government bill erläuternde bemerkungen zur regierungsvorlage rv blg nr xiii gp pg et seq stated the primary purpose of that provision wa to protect religious peace which wa an important element of general peace within a state religious peace wa to be understood a the peaceful coexistence of the various church and religious community with each other a well a with those who did not belong to a church or religious community the government concluded that the applicant criminal conviction had pursued the legitimate aim of maintaining order protecting religious peace and protecting the right of others namely their religious feeling the government argued that in their examination of the impugned statement the domestic court had in accordance with the court case law balanced the right of the applicant to disclose her view to the general public against the right of others to respect for their religious freedom they had comprehensively addressed the substance of the impugned statement and concluded that they had not been part of an objective discussion concerning islam and child marriage but had rather been aimed at defaming muhammad and therefore had been capable of arousing justified indignation the government reiterated that the supreme court had acknowledged that the issue of adult having sexual contact with minor gave rise to a public debate and the limit of acceptable criticism were therefore wider however the applicant statement in substance accused muhammad of paedophilia and in that respect lacked a sufficient factual basis they were disparaging towards muhammad and therefore had not contributed to an objective public debate referring to the court caselaw the government pointed out that critical statement regarded by believer a extremely insulting and provocative a well a general vehement attack on a religious or ethnic group were incompatible with the value of tolerance social peace and nondiscrimination which underlay the convention and therefore were not protected by the right to freedom of expression lastly the imposed sanction had been a moderate dayfine of eur the legal minimum for a duration of day thus only a third of the possible maximum period of day the thirdparty intervener the european centre for law and justice a thirdparty intervener submitted that statement which amounted to value judgment but were not devoid of any factual basis contributed to a public debate and did not imminently incite to violence were permissible under article of the convention it observed that a criminal conviction which pursued the aim of protecting the belief itself rather than the believer feeling wa one of blasphemy a criminal charge which according to international law standard should be abolished it argued that article of the criminal code served a a deterrent chilling effect obstructing free debate having recourse to a criminal sanction rather than a civillaw one to protect freedom of religion wa not necessary in a democratic society the court assessment the court considers and this wa common ground between the party that the criminal conviction giving rise to the instant case amounted to an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression such interference constitutes a breach of article unless it is prescribed by law pursues one or more of the legitimate aim referred to in paragraph and is necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve the aim or aim in questiona prescribed by law the court note that it wa undisputed that the interference had been prescribed by law the applicant conviction being based on article of the criminal codeb legitimate aim while the applicant stressed that her statement had never been aimed at disparaging muhammad she did not dispute the legitimate purpose of criminal conviction under article of the criminal code namely to protect religious peace the court endorses the government assessment that the impugned interference pursued the aim of preventing disorder by safeguarding religious peace a well a protecting religious feeling which corresponds to protecting the right of others within the meaning of article of the conventionc necessary in a democratic societyi general principle the court reiterates the fundamental principle underlying it judgment relating to article a set out for example in handyside v the united kingdom december series a no and in fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb the court further note that there is little scope under article of the convention for restriction on political speech or on debate on question of public interest see baka v hungary gc no echr and satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no echr extract those who choose to exercise the freedom to manifest their religion under article of the convention irrespective of whether they do so a member of a religious majority or a minority therefore can not expect to be exempt from criticism they must tolerate and accept the denial by others of their religious belief and even the propagation by others of doctrine hostile to their faith see otto preminger institut i̇a v turkey and aydın tatlav all cited above a paragraph of article recognises however the exercise of the freedom of expression carry with it duty and responsibility amongst them in the context of religious belief is the general requirement to ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the right guaranteed under article to the holder of such belief including a duty to avoid a far a possible an expression that is in regard to object of veneration gratuitously offensive to others and profane see sekmadienis ltd v lithuania no january with further reference where such expression go beyond the limit of a critical denial of other people religious belief and are likely to incite religious intolerance for example in the event of an improper or even abusive attack on an object of religious veneration a state may legitimately consider them to be incompatible with respect for the freedom of thought conscience and religion and take proportionate restrictive measure see for example mutatis mutandis otto preminger institut and i̇a v turkey both cited above in addition expression that seek to spread incite or justify hatred based on intolerance including religious intolerance do not enjoy the protection afforded by article of the convention see mutatis mutandis gündüz cited above in examining whether restriction on the right and freedom guaranteed by the convention can be considered necessary in a democratic society the court ha frequently held that the contracting state enjoy a certain margin of appreciation see for example wingrove cited above and and murphy v ireland no echr ix extract the absence of a uniform european conception of the requirement of the protection of the right of others in relation to attack on their religious conviction broadens the contracting state margin of appreciation when regulating freedom of expression in relation to matter liable to offend personal conviction within the sphere of moral or religion see otto preminger institut wingrove i̇a giniewski and aydın tatlav all cited above not only do they enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in that respect they also have the positive obligation under article of the convention of ensuring the peaceful coexistence of all religion and those not belonging to a religious group by ensuring mutual tolerance see leyla şahin v turkey gc no echr xi and sa v france gc no echr extract a state may therefore legitimately consider it necessary to take measure aimed at repressing certain form of conduct including the imparting of information and idea judged incompatible with respect for the freedom of thought conscience and religion of others see in the context of article kokkinakis v greece may series a no a see also otto preminger institut and aydın tatlav both cited above it is however for the court to give a final ruling on the restriction compatibility with the convention and it will do so by assessing it in the circumstance of a particular case the issue before the court therefore involves weighing up the conflicting interest of the exercise of two fundamental freedom namely the right of the applicant to impart to the public her view on religious doctrine on the one hand and the right of others to respect for their freedom of thought conscience and religion on the other see otto preminger institut and aydın tatlav both cited above in it caselaw the court ha distinguished between statement of fact and value judgment the classification of a statement a fact or a a value judgment is a matter which first and foremost fall within the margin of appreciation of the national authority in particular the domestic court see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no however the court can change this classification when exercising it supervisory function see kharmalov v russia no october and pinto pinheiro marque v portugal no january in previous case the court ha emphasised that the truth of value judgment is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article however even where a statement amount to a value judgment the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive a the court ha noted in previous case the difference lie in the degree of factual proof which ha to be established see jerusalem v austria no echr ii feldek v slovakia no echr viii and genner v austria no january in exercising it supervisory function it is not the court task to take the place of the national authority but rather to review under article in the light of the case a a whole the decision they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation particularly whether they based their decision on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see vogt v germany september series a no and jerusalem cited above with further reference and whether the interference corresponded to a pressing social need and wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued see i̇a cited above with further reference in order to determine it proportionality the court must consider the impugned interference not only in the light of the content of the statement at issue but also the context in which they were made furthermore the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are also factor to be taken into account see for example gündüz cited above where the balancing exercise ha been undertaken by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the court would require strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see von hannover v germany no gc no and february ii application of the above principle to the instant case the court note at the outset that the subject matter of the instant case is of a particularly sensitive nature and that the potential effect of the impugned statement depend to a certain degree on the situation in the country where the statement were made at the time and the context in which they were made accordingly and notwithstanding some of the domestic court consideration such a the duration of the marriage in question the court therefore considers that the domestic authority had a wide margin of appreciation in the instant case a they were in a better position to evaluate which statement were likely to disturb the religious peace in their country the court note that the domestic court considered the applicant statement a having been made in public see paragraph in fine above indeed the seminar were widely advertised to the public on the internet and via leaflet the latter were sent out by the head of the rightwing freedom party addressing them especially to young voter and praising them a top seminar in the framework of a free education package the applicant intervention wa entitled basic information on islam and wa meant to be a critical analysis of islamic doctrine allowing for a discussion with the participant of the seminar the title gave the in hindsight misleading impression that the seminar would include objective information on islam it appears that anyone interested wa able to enrol there wa no requirement to be a member of the freedom party the applicant therefore could not assume that there would only be likeminded people in the room who would share her very critical view of islam but had to expect that there could also be people among the audience who might be offended by her statement it is of little relevance that only thirty people attended on average the applicant statement were in fact recorded by a journalist who had participated in the seminar and whose employer subsequently reported them to the public prosecutor see paragraph above the court reiterates that a religious group must tolerate the denial by others of their religious belief and even the propagation by others of doctrine hostile to their faith a long a the statement at issue do not incite to hatred or religious intolerance article of the criminal code see paragraph above doe not in fact incriminate all behaviour that is likely to hurt religious feeling or amount to blasphemy but additionally requires that the circumstance of such behaviour were capable of arousing justified indignation and thus aim at the protection of religious peace and tolerance the court note that the domestic court explained extensively why they considered that the applicant statement had been capable of arousing justified indignation on the ground that they had not been made in an objective manner aimed at contributing to a debate of public interest but could only be understood a having been aimed at demonstrating that muhammad wa not a worthy subject of worship see paragraph above the court endorses this assessment when saying what do we call it if it is not paedophilia the applicant according to her own statement wa quoting a conversation she had had with her sister who wa of the opinion that one had to paraphrase the accusation that muhammad wa a paedophile say it in a more diplomatic way the court note that the applicant described herself a an expert in the field of islamic doctrine already having held seminar of that kind for a while her argument that the impugned statement had been made in the context of a lively discussion in which they could not be revoked see paragraph above is therefore not convincing contrast gündüz cited above the court therefore agrees with the domestic court that the applicant must have been aware that her statement were partly based on untrue fact and liable to arouse justified indignation in others in that context the court reiterates that the convention state are required in accordance with their positive obligation under article of the convention to ensure the peaceful coexistence of religious and nonreligious group and individual under their jurisdiction by ensuring an atmosphere of mutual tolerance see paragraph above the court endorses the regional court statement in it judgment of february that presenting object of religious worship in a provocative way capable of hurting the feeling of the follower of that religion could be conceived a a malicious violation of the spirit of tolerance which wa one of the base of a democratic society see paragraph in fine above the court note that the domestic court qualified the impugned statement a value judgment based on a detailed analysis of the wording of the statement made see in particular paragraph above they found that the applicant had subjectively labelled muhammad with a general sexual preference for paedophilia and had failed to neutrally inform her audience of the historical background which consequently had not allowed for a serious debate on that issue see paragraph and above the court therefore agrees with the domestic court that the impugned statement can be classified a value judgment not having a sufficient factual basis even if they were to be classified a factual statement a the applicant insisted she failed to adduce any evidence to that end both during the domestic proceeding and before the court a to the applicant argument that a few individual statement had to be tolerated during a lively discussion the court considers that it is not compatible with article of the convention to package incriminating statement in the wrapping of an otherwise acceptable expression of opinion and deduce that this render statement exceeding the permissible limit of freedom of expression passable moreover the applicant wa wrong to assume that improper attack on religious group had to be tolerated even if they were based on untrue fact see paragraph above on the contrary the court ha held that statement which are based on manifestly untrue fact do not enjoy the protection of article see mutatis mutandis giniewski cited above and medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no echr lastly the court reiterates that the applicant wa ordered to pay a moderate fine of only eur in total for the three statement made although the criminal code alternatively provided for up to six month imprisonment furthermore the fine imposed wa at the lower end of the statutory scale of punishment of up to dayfines namely only dayfines and the domestic court applied only the minimum daily amount of eur although the applicant had no previous criminal record and this wa taken into account a a mitigating factor her repeated infringement had to be considered a an aggravating factor under the circumstance the court doe not consider the criminal sanction to be disproportionate in conclusion the court find that in the instant case the domestic court comprehensively assessed the wider context of the applicant statement and carefully balanced her right to freedom of expression with the right of others to have their religious feeling protected and to have religious peace preserved in austrian society they discussed the permissible limit of criticism of religious doctrine versus their disparagement and found that the applicant statement had been likely to arouse justified indignation in muslim in addition the court considers that the impugned statement were not phrased in a neutral manner aimed at making an objective contribution to a public debate concerning child marriage contrast aydın tatlav and giniewski both cited above but amounted to a generalisation without a factual basis thus by considering them a going beyond the permissible limit of an objective debate and classifying them a an abusive attack on the prophet of islam which wa capable of stirring up prejudice and putting religious peace at risk the domestic court came to the conclusion that the fact at issue contained element of incitement to religious intolerance the court accepts that they thereby put forward relevant and sufficient reason and find that the interference with the applicant right under article did indeed correspond to a pressing social need and wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued therefore the court considers that the domestic court did not overstep their wide margin of appreciation in the instant case when convicting the applicant of disparaging religious doctrine accordingly there ha been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the application admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on october pursuant to rule and of the

violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the supreme court judgment of november had entailed an interference with his right to freedom of expression that wa not necessary in a democratic society and did not pursue a legitimate aim and thus violated article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty

of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the court note that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submissionsa the applicant the applicant maintained that article of the convention wa not at issue in the case because the statement had not affected a reputation to a sufficient degree the statement were not defamatory or innuendo against a there wa nothing presented in the news item to the effect that a had been guilty of a financial crime or other action punishable by law the applicant stated that the news item concerned report of loan facility and international financial transfer that had taken place before the financial crisis and it had contributed to an ongoing and pressing social debate on the circumstance in iceland leading up to the crisis in the medium had been covering these event and the individual involved including a who had been widely known a an important figure in the icelandic business sector prior to the financial crisis a had been in the spotlight a part of a public debate in iceland for a long time both in relation to his various business dealing and court proceeding and therefore he had to sustain closer scrutiny of his act than a private individual or an ordinary professional in the applicant view the interest of a could not outweigh his freedom of expression when imparting information on important matter of legitimate public concern the applicant claimed that he had acted in good faith when preparing the news item relying on sufficiently accurate evidence verbal and written information from more than one source which he considered highly reliable the supreme court had expected him to present document in the case which proved the legitimacy of the statement beyond doubt the burden of proof imposed on him by the supreme court had not been legitimate or possible to meet a he had the right to protect his source and to keep them and the documentation behind news item confidential in addition he had tried to contact a via telephone and email when preparing the news piece after the broadcast a had released a press statement which wa included in the corresponding news article online later the same day the applicant had therefore acted in good faith to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethic of journalism the broadcast had been put forth in an objective manner and the style had not been provocative or exaggeratedb the government in the government opinion the impugned restriction on the applicant exercise of freedom of expression had corresponded to a pressing social need and had been justified by relevant and sufficient reason namely a reputation and honour the measure taken had been proportionate to the legitimate aimed pursued furthermore the supreme court in it assessment had applied the standard that were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and of the convention a interpreted in the court caselaw the government maintained that the statement including the impugned word had been statement of fact which the applicant had failed to present in a balanced manner the statement had been untrue and insinuated criminal behaviour on the part of a the applicant had lacked evidence to support the statement and his attempt to contact a to verify the information before the broadcast had been vague at best he had failed to abide by the journalistic duty identified by the court to prepare the material in good faith in the government opinion the applicant should be required to verify statement made by his or her source and thus exercise care in the gathering use and presentation of material the government claimed that even though the aftermath of the financial crisis in iceland in wa an important social matter relevant to public debate the impugned statement had not contributed to public debate on social issue a regard the applicant claim about a press statement being published with the news article online the government maintained that this argument had not been a part of the applicant initial complaint and did not appear to have been raised before the domestic court that indicated that the applicant had not been responsible for publishing the statement or even aware of it the court assessmenta whether there wa an interference it is common ground between the party that the impugned judgment constituted an interference by a public authority with the applicant right to freedom of expression a guaranteed under the first paragraph of article b whether it wa prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim it is not in dispute that the impugned measure had a basis in article s and of the penal code section of the broadcasting act and section of the tort liability act the court is moreover satisfied that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or right of othersc whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic societyi general principle the principle concerning the question of whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the court caselaw see among other authority delfi a v estonia gc no to echr with further reference the court ha held that a person reputation even if that person is being criticised in the context of a public debate form part of his or her personal identity and psychological integrity and therefore fall within the scope of his or her private life in order for article to come into play the attack on personal honour and reputation must attain a certain level of gravity and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see inter alia a v norway no april having been required on numerous occasion to consider dispute requiring an examination of the fair balance to be struck between the right to respect for private life and the right to freedom of expression the court ha developed general principle emerging from abundant caselaw in this area see among other authority couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no to echr extract the criterion which are relevant when balancing the right to freedom of expression against the right to respect for private life are inter alia the contribution to a debate of general interest how well known the person concerned is and what the subject of the report is his or her prior conduct the method of obtaining the information and it veracity the content form and consequence of the publication and the severity of the sanction imposed see for example axel springer ag v germany gc no and to february and von hannover v germany no gc no and to echr finally the court recall that where the national authority have weighed up the interest at stake in compliance with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw strong reason are required if it is to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see bedat v switzerland gc no echr ii application of those principle to the present case in the present case the court find it appropriate to examine the abovementioned principle in the following order the content form and consequence of the publication how well known the person concerned is and the prior conduct of the person concerned the subject matter of the report and the contribution to the debate of general interest the method of obtaining the information and it veracity and the severity of the sanction imposedα content form and consequence of the impugned article the court note that the supreme court in it judgment of november conducted a thorough assessment of the news item concluding that when the content of the news item debated in this case is assessed a a whole and the disputed remark are evaluated in context with other statement in the news item and in consideration of the visual presentation the comment clearly implied that a had had committed an act which wa punishable in accordance with the penal code no under article of the penal code the supreme court declared the impugned word null and void thus in the assessment of the supreme court the news item for which the applicant wa responsible contained accusation of a factual nature concerning unlawful and criminal act the court see no reason to call into question the supreme court evaluation on this point it is also satisfied that the attack on a reputation reached the level of seriousness and that it manner caused prejudice to a enjoyment of the right to respect for private life so a to fall within the scope of article of the convention see inter alia a v norway no april in this respect it is recalled that the potential impact of the medium of expression concerned is an important factor in the consideration of the proportionality of an interference and that the audiovisual medium have a more immediate and powerful effect than the print medium see for example jersild v denmark judgment of september series a no β how well known the person concerned is and his conduct prior to the publication of the impugned article the district court in it judgment of november stated inter alia that a a well a the company he represented had been in the medium and public debate for many year a had also been very prominent in business in iceland and abroad both in a negative and positive light a company led by him had held an active share in one of the three major icelandic bank and news of a had therefore more often than not been about his role in the banking collapse the supreme court did not directly comment in it reasoning on a status within the context of the applicant reporting however examining the reasoning of the supreme court in it entirety the court deems it sufficiently demonstrated that the supreme court proceeded on the basis that a wa to be considered a public person for the purpose of it assessment therefore the limit of acceptable criticism were accordingly wider than in the case of a private individual see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no to echr extract with further reference however the court further note that while reporting on true fact about politician or other public person private life may be admissible in certain circumstance even person known to the public have a legitimate expectation of protection of and respect for their private life see standard verlags gmb h v austria no no june γ the subject matter of the report and contribution to a debate of general interest the supreme court in it judgment of december stated inter alia the following in assessing where the line should be drawn between freedom of expression a protected by article of the constitution and the right to privacy a protected by article of the constitution it is important to determine

him rather than a to secure such evidence the applicant had also not demonstrated that he had sought information from a on the content while preparing the news item he had therefore failed in his duty a outlined in article of the national broadcast service rule on news and related programming dated may to seek information from both or all party and attempt to show their point of view a equally a possible the court concluded that the applicant could not have been acting in good faith a pertains to the accuracy of the remark in the news item on this point the court likewise see no reason to call into question the supreme court conclusion it reiterates that the safeguard afforded by article to journalist in relation to reporting on issue of general interest is subject to the provision that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the ethic of journalism see for example bédat cited above furthermore the court find that there were no special ground in the present case to dispense the medium from their ordinary obligation to verify factual statement that are defamatory of private individual see inter alia björk eiðsdóttir v iceland no july the applicant referred to the right to protect his source and to keep his source and the documentation behind the news item confidential the court reiterates in this respect that protection of journalistic source is one of the basic condition for press freedom without which source may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matter of public concern see for example ruokanen and others v finland no april in the present case however the applicant wa at no stage required to disclose the identity of his source furthermore in the view of the court a mere reference to protection of source can not exempt a journalist from the obligation to prove the veracity of or have sufficient factual basis for serious accusation of a factual nature an obligation that can be met without necessarily having to reveal the source in question the court further note that the applicant requested and received confirmation from the public prosecutor about an ongoing investigation into the loan transaction but only after the defamation case at hand had been instigated moreover this letter only confirmed that the loan transaction had been reported and wa under investigation it did not state that a had been charged indicted or wa on trial or had been convicted of a crime see paragraph aboveε severity of the sanction imposed the court note that the defamation proceeding brought by a against the applicant ended in an order by the supreme court declaring the impugned word null and void and requiring the applicant to pay to a isk in compensation for nonpecuniary damage plus interest and isk for a cost before the domestic court the court doe not find the compensation excessive in the circumstance or to be of such a kind a to have a chilling effect on the exercise of medium freedom see inter alia pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi with further referencesζ conclusion in the light of all the abovementioned consideration the court considers that the supreme court balanced the right of freedom of expression with the right to respect for private life and took into account the criterion set out in the court caselaw the court recall that although opinion may differ on the outcome of a judgment where the balancing exercise ha been undertaken by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court case law the court would require strong reason to substitute it own view for that of the domestic court see paragraph above the supreme court acted within the margin of appreciation afforded to it and struck a reasonable balance between the measure imposed restricting the right to freedom of expression and the legitimate aim pursued the court therefore concludes

not have been deemed disseminated ml filed an objection in which he submitted in particular that a number of official of the district administration had read the disputed statement that some copy of the book had already been distributed to the school library and that the applicant himself had earlier claimed that he had distributed fifty copy of the book he also submitted letter from the head and deputy head of the district administration in which they expressed indignation with the fact that the applicant had published a gratuitous attack on ml reputation and suggested that he may have done so in revenge for ml refusal to allot a plot of land to the applicant mother on october the ivano frankivsk regional court the regional court dismissed the applicant cassation appeal and the judgment of october became final the district administration did not return it copy of the book to the publishing house according to the applicant it instead distributed a number of book to various recipient having cut out the page which contained the disputed text on may the presidium of the regional court quashed the judgment of and october following a request by the applicant for a supervisory review протест and remitted the case to the city court for fresh examination in summer the applicant lodged a counterclaim against ml within the framework of the initial defamation proceeding he referred to a number of purported shortcoming in ml official conduct a mayor and submitted that by complaining to the authority about the publication the mayor had simply sought to compromise the applicant reputation among his colleague and the general public the applicant further complained that ml had published a disparaging article about him in a local newspaper and sought compensation for nonpecuniary damage and the retraction of several purportedly defamatory statement made in the article at issue this counterclaim wa joined by the city court for examination together with the defamation claim brought against the applicant on september the city court transferred the case to the kosivskyy district court for examination the applicant appealed against that decision seeking a transfer of the case to his local court on october the ivano frankivsk regional court of appeal the former ivano frankivsk regional court ordered the case to be remitted to the city court having noted that that court had already started examining the case and that there were no ground for the case to be transferred to another court on several further occasion the city court rejected request by the applicant for the case to be transferred to his local court and for the presiding judge of the city court to be removed from the case between october and october some five hearing were adjourned on account of the applicant failure to appear on october the city court heard the case and delivered it judgment allowing ml claim in part and dismissing the applicant counterclaim the legal part of the judgment concerning ml claim stated a follows having heard the party and having examined the material in the case file the court considers that the claim should be allowed in part on the following ground statement that the mayor ml an omnipotent feudal prince had brutally breached the election legislation are rebutted by the decision of the kosivskyy district court of june and the civil division of the ivano frankivsk regional court of july from which it follows that the claimant had not breached the election law a the claim made by the group of deputy seeking an annulment of the list of the district election committee wa dismissed statement that ml had acted outrageously towards lv are rebutted by the decision of the kosmach village council of march to grant ownership of a plot of land to lv and also the statement concerning the settlement of the matter concerning restitution of the house are rebutted by the decision of the kosivskyy district court of october in respect of the claim by ol ml spouse against y concerning the annulment of the privatisation certificate issued in y name the court considers that the applicant arbitrarily used the aegis of the lviv institute of internal affair in publishing the work and inserted on page statement unsubstantiated by evidence regard being had to the liability of the applicant the gravity of the harm inflicted on the plaintiff a a public official the fact that the publication of the false statement negatively affected his image in the eye of the district administration his acquaintance and his fellow villager the fact that copy of the publication had been widely read by library school and the district administration and the fact that fifty copy had been taken by the applicant some of them already having been disseminated and regard also being had to the time invested by the plaintiff in the judicial examination of his case the direct liability of the applicant in inflicting harm the court considers that some compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage should be awarded the city court next awarded ml uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage to be paid by the applicant and ordered that the disputed statement be retracted the relevant passage of the operative part of the judgment read a followsthe publishing house l shall publish erratum sheet додатки to the book the kosiv area antiquity retracting the statement mentioned above that do not reflect reality to be paid for by the applicant the applicant appealed he challenged in particular the court finding that the impugned information in the book had been disseminated widely claiming that the court had not established who had disseminated his book and exactly who had read it on february the regional court upheld the finding of the city court with respect to ml claim endorsing it reasoning a relevant and sufficient at the same time the court found that no sufficient reason had been stated for rejecting the applicant counterclaim and remitted it to the city court for fresh examination the applicant lodged a cassation appeal in which he referred to article of the convention and the provision of national law guaranteeing freedom of speech alleging that the judgment against him were indicative of political repression and seeking to have the finding of the lower court with respect to ml claim overturned the applicant maintained in particular that the final three sentence challenged by the mayor had been his value judgment concerning unnamed public official and could not have been deemed defamatory to the mayor he further maintained that he could not afford to pay the damage moreover whether ml had actually suffered any damage had never been established in particular the district administration had received four hundred and fifty out of five hundred copy of the book which had been in it possession since the day the action had been lodged the district administration had later distributed some of those book to the public in breach of the court order of october requiring it to return them to the publishing house for reprinting nevertheless the disputed statement had not reached the public a employee of the district administration had cut out the controversial page in breach of the author copyright what had become of the other fifty copy of the book had never been established even if member of the public had obtained access to the disputed statement this could not have affected the mayor reputation in any significant way since the applicant had only recapitulated and reported information that had already been common public knowledge in support of this allegation the applicant submitted copy of numerous newspaper article criticising the mayor and statement by individual claiming that they had been offended by him in various way the applicant maintained that these document served a sufficient evidence that his statement had been true and that he could not understand how to draft a retraction of the true statement the district administration filed objection to the applicant cassation appeal it contended in particular that they had not cut out any page from the disputed book before distributing it ml also filed objection to the applicant cassation appeal he noted in particular that the applicant allegation that the nonpecuniary damage award wa disproportionate with respect to his income were speculative since he had never disclosed his income on march the city court stayed the examination of the applicant counterclaim against ml pending consideration of the cassation appeal on june the supreme court of ukraine rejected the applicant request for leave to appeal in cassation the bailiff service instituted enforcement proceeding against the applicant in the course of which he wa bound to pay the judgment debt in instalment of of his main income retirement pension it appears that the debt wa paid in full by june between july and april the city court adjourned some seven hearing in the case concerning the applicant counterclaim against ml either on account of the party absence or the unavailability of recording equipment on april the ivano frankivsk regional department of education and science informed the applicant that it had received fifty copy of the book from the district administration in thirtyfive of which had been distributed to local school others remaining in the department library none of the copy received had page missing the department also noted that ml acting a a private person had distributed erratum sheet to the book recepients notifying them that the statement criticising him had been deemed false and defamatory by the court on november the city court rejected the applicant defamation claim against ml a unsubstantiated and vexatious on january the regional court upheld that judgment and on january the rivne regional court of appeal acting a a court of cassation rejected a request by the applicant for leave to appeal in cassation on april the city court rejected a claim made by the applicant against the bailiff who had enforced the judgment of october it appears from the case file that he did not pursue that claim any further on april the city court rejected a claim made by the applicant against the publishing house for it alleged failure to comply with the judgment of october it appears from the case file that the applicant did not pursue that claim any further either in may the applicant instituted proceeding against ml in the city court he claimed in particular that he had unlawfully published a pseudoretraction of the applicant statement found defamatory which resulted in the breach of the applicant copyright and denigration of his dignity it appears that the proceeding are

lengthy and that his right to a fair hearing had been breached a the court had failed to respond to his argument and state adequate reason for their finding in the judgment given in ml defamation claim he referred to article of the convention which insofar a relevant read a follows in the determination of his civil right and obligation everyone is entitled to a fair hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law the government did not submit any objection concerning the admissibility of the above complaint in addition to the above complaint the applicant lodged numerous other complaint under article of the convention alleging that his right to a fair trial had not been respected a admissibility the court find that the applicant complaint concerning the length of the proceeding and alleged failure of the domestic court to state adequate reason for their decision taken in the defamation proceeding are not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that they are not inadmissible on any other ground they must therefore be declared admissible a regard the remainder of the complaint mentioned in paragraph above having considered them in the light of all the material in it possession the court find that in so far a the matter complained of are within it competence they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the right and freedom set out in the convention and must be declared inadmissible a being manifestly illfounded pursuant to article a and of the convention b merit alleged violation of article of the convention on account of the length of the proceedingsa the period to be taken into account the applicant viewed the proceeding at issue in the present case a one set which had started when ml had lodged a defamation claim against him and had ended when the final judgment had been taken in respect of his counterclaim the government viewed the proceeding at issue a two set whose length had to be assessed separately in the court view regard being had in particular to the manner in which the domestic court treated the proceeding at issue see paragraph and above it is feasible to ass the overall length of the proceeding concerning the determination of ml defamation claim and the applicant counterclaim against him in their entirety accordingly the court note that the proceeding lasted from april when ml claim wa lodged with the kosivskyy district court until january when the final decision wa taken in respect of the applicant counter claim it follows that the proceeding lasted nine year and nearly nine monthsb reasonableness of the length of the proceeding the applicant submitted that the proceeding in his case had been delayed on account of the improper approach of the judicial authority in performing their professional duty the government contested this view the court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceeding must be assessed in the light of the circumstance of the case and with reference to the following criterion the complexity of the case the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authority and what wa at stake for the applicant in the dispute see among many other authority frydlender v france gc no echr vii the court note that a can be seen from the material before it some delay in the proceeding in the present case were caused by the applicant conduct in particular his repeated failure to appear for the hearing at the same time a number of other delay were caused by other factor including adjournment of hearing on account of other party absence and various scheduling issue remittal of the case for reconsideration and extended period of judicial inactivity in addition the proceeding were also delayed on account of the nonenforcement and eventual quashing of the final judgment of october the court ha frequently found violation in case raising issue similar to those in the present case see for example pavlyulynets v ukraine no september golovko v ukraine no february and chukhas v ukraine no july having examined all the material submitted to it the court considers that the government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case having regard to it caselaw on the subject it considers that in the instant case the length of the proceeding wa excessive and failed to meet the reasonable time requirement there ha accordingly been a breach of article in this respect alleged violation of article of the convention on account of the purported inadequacy of the reasoning in the court decision the applicant submitted that the domestic court had failed to provide sufficient reasoning for their factual finding and had reached arbitrary conclusion in the defamation proceeding against him first of all they had failed to substantiate their finding that the statement found to be defamatory had actually been disseminated a it had never been established who had distributed the disputed text when and how it had been done or what the circle of it actual readership had been second the court had ignored that the district administration had been in control of most of the copy of the book before the defamation proceeding had been instituted and that the applicant role in the dissemination of the text if any had been negligible at most finally in assessing the damage purportedly caused to the plaintiff the domestic judicial authority had arbitrarily disregarded numerous material such a newspaper article criticizing ml and declaration signed by people who had purportedly suffered injustice because of him showing that the disputed statement did not emanate from the applicant and that he had merely compiled information which had already been circulated widely the government contested the applicant submission and maintained that he had benefitted from all the guarantee of a fair trial by independent and impartial court which had properly assessed the factual evidence before them and given sufficient reason for their decision in particular the applicant allegation that he could not be held liable for the dissemination of the disputed statement had been at odds with his own submission made to the city court on october according to which he had obtained and distributed fifty copy of the book his later allegation that he had destroyed one hundred copy of the book which contradicted his earlier statement and other evidence on file showed that he had been acting in bad faith and had tried to mislead the court the civil court not having an investigative function had based their conclusion on the evidence provided by the party which in the circumstance of the present case wa sufficient for making the relevant conclusion the court reiterates that article obliges the court to give reason for their judgment but can not be understood a requiring a detailed answer to every argument see van de hurk v the netherlands april series a no this obligation is an essential procedural safeguard under article of the convention a it demonstrates to the party that their argument have been heard affords them the possibility of objecting to or appealing against the decision and also serf to justify the reason for a judicial decision to the public see eg suominen v finland no july and boldea v romania no february the principle of fairness enshrined in article of the convention would be disturbed where domestic court ignore a specific pertinent and important point made by an applicant see eg pronina v ukraine no july and mala v ukraine no july otherwise it is in the first place for the national court to interpret domestic law and the court will not substitute it own interpretation for theirs in the absence of arbitrariness see eg mala cited above turning to the fact of the present case the court note the scarcity of the reasoning provided in the city court judgment of october in support of some of it conclusion most of the court reasoning is dedicated to substantiating a conclusion that the factual allegation against the plaintiff were false other conclusion such a that the book had been widely read or that the plaintiff reputation had suffered damage warranting the payment of compensation are couched in rather formulaic term without any further explanation a to why the court made such finding and on which evidence they were based the judgment taken by the appellate court and the court of cassation endorsed the above reasoning a sufficient without responding expressly to the applicant argument concerning the role of the district administration in the distribution of the book and a number of his other submission on the other hand the court doe not find any basis on which to conclude that the overall factual finding of the domestic court in the case at issue were manifestly arbitrary or that the scarcity of the reasoning provided extinguished the very essence of the applicant procedural right under article see thoma v luxembourg no dec may and contrast boldea cited above in particular it is clear from the case file that the applicant authored the disputed article with a direct purpose for it to reach the public and that his text wa printed in a book and became known to person other than the plaintiff it is also notable that the disputed text phrased a a recital of the applicant own conviction and without any reference to external source wa intended to leave the reader with a clear impression that the plaintiff had been involved in corrupt and unfair dealing incompatible with his public office the court find that this message wa a such inherently damaging to the plaintiff reputation and accepts that once the book in which it wa published entered public domain it wa a daunting task to establish the circle of it actual and potential readership or to quantify the real impact this message would have on them over the period of it circulation in this connection the court can also not accept the applicant assertion that the reader would have necessarily been aware of the factual background of the view he had sought to convey overall there is nothing in the case file to warrant a finding that a more detailed analysis of the actual scope of dissemination of the disputed passage or it actual impact on the diminishment of the plaintiff prestige could have materially affected the general conclusion reached by the domestic court a to whether or not the defamation offence had taken place in so far a the applicant complained that the domestic court had failed to address his argument concerning the important role of the district administration in distributing the book the court recall that the district administration wa not a respondent in the proceeding at issue and that the question of it liability wa therefore outside their scope in the court view an assessment of the district administration role could have been of importance in the applicant defamation proceeding had there been a question of excluding his own responsibility in view of this role however the applicant being the author of the disputed text published with his consent in a book intended for distribution to the public the court find no arbitrariness in the fact that his responsibility in it dissemination wa found to be engaged regardless of how many book he had personally distributed to the end reader based on the material at hand the court can not speculate either a to whether the role of the district administration wa accounted for in the determination of the amount of damage levied against the applicant particularly a the applicant himself failed to provide a clear and consistent information concerning his own role in the actual distribution of the book see paragraph and and above in view of the above consideration the court concludes that the applicant failed to show that the domestic judicial authority had ignored a specific pertinent and important point made by him in context of the proceeding at issue in these circumstance it is not for the court to take upon itself the role of a linguistic corrector or to secondguess the domestic court judgment involving the use of subjective and unquantifiable category such a that the publication had been widely read or negatively affected the plaintiff image accordingly the court doe not find that in the circumstance of the present case the very fact that the domestic court did not elaborate in more detail on the reasoning for their judgment and did not expressly respond to some of the applicant argument resulted in his right guaranteed by article being extinguished the court therefore find that there ha been no violation of article of the convention in this respect ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the state authority had arbitrarily and unfairly interfered with his freedom to criticise the conduct of a public official the applicant relied on article of the convention which in so far a relevant read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the government did not submit any comment concerning the admissibility of this complaint the court note that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention and that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submissionsa the applicant the applicant submitted that there wa no pressing social need for restricting his expression in the present case comparing his case to that of lingens v austria july series a no he submitted that his publication constituted a legitimate value judgment concerning misconduct of a public official based on information which had already been common public knowledge the judicial authority had failed to recognise his text a an expression of a value judgment and had disregarded the evidence presented by him in support of the truthfulness of the underlying factual allegation the applicant further submitted that the interference wa also disproportionate in particular he had been made to pay a sum which had no connection to the damage purportedly suffered by the plaintiff or to the applicant personal role in the dissemination of the disputed text and which had been onerous on his family budget furthermore the vagueness of the language used in the judgment ordering the statement to be retracted had prevented him from executing the order and had resulted in ml publishing an erratum sheet at his own instigation in which he had accused the applicant of lying and undermined his credibility a an academic researcher lastly the overall manner in which the state authority had approached the applicant case had been unlawful corrupt unfair and humiliating in particular the district administration had failed to execute the court judgment of october and had been distributing copy of the book a it saw fit with page cut out while the proceeding had been pending the conduct of the authority had a chilling effect on the applicant research a it kept him in a state of continuous uncertainty a to the fate of his publication and had resulted in a situation where the muchawaited research of which he wa a coauthor had not achieved the publicity and social acclaim it deservedb the government the government submitted that the finding against the applicant in the defamation proceeding constituted a legitimate restriction of his right guaranteed by article of the convention in particular it pursued a legitimate aim namely the protection of ml reputation and had been based on provision of the domestic law which were accessible and foreseeable they submitted that the interference wa also necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to the aim pursued in particular the domestic caselaw at the material time had been wellequipped to differentiate between value judgment and statement of fact the applicant in the present case had been held liable not for expressing a value judgment but for having made false factual allegation accusing ml of serious misconduct he himself had treated those allegation a factual in both the domestic and the convention proceeding in his case and had sought to have documentary and other evidence examined in support of his position the domestic court had thoroughly examined the evidence presented by both party and had dismissed the applicant argument a speculative and unsubstantiated in their reasoned judgment the applicant had enjoyed the benefit of a fair procedure his argument had been examined by independent and impartial court at three level of jurisdiction the judicial authority had enabled him to present evidence in support of his position and had stated relevant and sufficient reason for their finding lastly in so far a the applicant complained that the district administration had acted unlawfully in particular by failing to return the book to the publisher or distributing them contrary to his volition he had not duly raised these complaint before the domestic authority the court assessment the court note that the finding against the applicant in the defamation proceeding constituted an interference with his right guaranteed under article of the convention see myrskyy v ukraine no may it further agrees that this interference in the present case wa in accordance with the law see ukrainian medium group v ukraine no march and gazeta ukraina tsentr v ukraine no july and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting ml reputation it remains therefore to be determined whether this interference wa also necessary in a democratic society in this connection the court reiterates that the test of necessity requires it to determine whether the interference corresponded to a pressing social need whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason given by the national authority to justify it were relevant and sufficient see among many other authority cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no and echr xi the court task in exercising it supervisory function is not to take the place of the competent domestic court but rather to review whether the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and whether in this context they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see among other authority fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i and ringier axel springer slovakia a s v slovakia no and july the court must also ascertain whether the domestic authority struck a fair balance between on the one hand the protection of freedom of expression a enshrined in article and on the other the protection of the reputation of those against whom allegation have been made a right which a an aspect of private life is protected by article of the convention see among other authority chauvy and others v france no in fine echr vi and couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no november in addition the fairness of the proceeding the procedural guarantee afforded and the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are factor to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference see kwiecień v poland no january turning to the fact of the present case the court find that they are materially different from those examined in the lingens case cited by the applicant in support of his complaint that case concerned the freedom of a journalist to criticise a leading politician at the national level in a periodical featuring discussion on current affair whereas the present case concern an academic criticizing the performance of a contemporary local official in an otherwise uncontroversial book presenting archaeological and historical research the court agrees that the subject of the applicant communication a such related to a legitimate matter of public concern nevertheless it fails to see the pertinence of the forum chosen by the applicant for expressing his critical view and doe not consider that the context in which they were published warranted the application of the same high tolerance standard appropriate for medium case such a lingens cited above or for other case involving expression in the context of pluralistic debate and exchange of opinion on matter of serious public concern see andrushko v russia no and october and steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii the court next note that in the lingens case the applicant wa penalised for disseminating critical value judgment not susceptible of proof whereas in the present case the core of the defamation action against the applicant concerned the accuracy of three specific factual allegation that the mayor had breached election legislation to obtain favourable election result that he had arranged for a disabled citizen to be deprived of a plot of land in favour of his personal acquaintance and that his family had corruptly acquired a house the court note that these accusation phrased a direct allegation of potentially criminal misconduct were quite serious it further reiterates that where allegation are made about the conduct of a third party it may sometimes be difficult to distinguish between assertion of fact and value judgment see cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre cited above nevertheless even a value judgment may be excessive if it ha no factual basis to support it ibid accordingly the court find no issue with the fact that the domestic court required the applicant to substantiate the factual allegation underlying the view he expressed which in the absence of sufficient proof could be regarded a defamatory it is also notable that the applicant himself treated the above factual allegation a true in his submission to the domestic judicial authority and to the court and presented various document which in his view showed that his statement were accurate while some sentence of the disputed text namely the first sentence where ml conduct wa compared to that of a feudal prince and the final sentence where the applicant expressed a general opinion about corrupt official clearly constituted value judgment the court find that they were so deeply intertwined with the overall factual message that the very fact that the domestic court had not addressed them separately in their judgment doe not of itself raise an issue in the present case the court next observes that it ha not been argued in the present case that the applicant wa precluded from submitting any evidence he deemed necessary in support of the veracity of the challenged factual statement in the domestic proceeding compare and contrast with andrushko v russia no october or more generally that the court made their decision without analysing some material important for contextual assessment of the applicant publication compare and contrast with ringier axel springer slovakia a v slovakia no no and january on the contrary it appears that the city court honoured the applicant effort to provide complete information for instance by adjourning a hearing at his request with a view to ordering pertinent archive material see paragraph above the court next observes that in finding that the applicant had insufficient source to substantiate the sweeping and disparaging conclusion he had made concerning ml character the city court cited a number of source including official document among them a court judgment in which an allegation of election fraud by ml had already been dismissed see paragraph above from the material before it the court doe not consider that the domestic court took an arbitrary decision or overstepped their margin of appreciation in finding that the applicant had insufficiently substantiated his factual conclusion and that his statement concerning ml misconduct had accordingly been defamatory in so far a the applicant submitted that the interference with his right did not correspond to a pressing social need a the disputed statement had in fact not been disseminated at the time the defamation action had been lodged and that he should not have been held liable for any subsequent dissemination the court ha already dismissed similar argument when examining his complaint under article of the convention see paragraph above in view of all the above the court concludes that the domestic court provided relevant and sufficient reason justifying a conclusion that interference with the applicant right under article corresponded to a pressing social need a regard the proportionality of this interference the court recall that the applicant wa ordered to cover the cost of publishing an erratum sheet to the book containing a retraction of the statement found to be defamatory and to pay ml uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage in so far a the applicant complained that he had been obliged to cover the cost of publishing a retraction by a court order so vague and overbroad that it had been practically impossible to enforce it the court doe not find that regard being had to the margin of appreciation afforded to the national court the order to retract defamatory statement wa a such disproportionate in the present case particularly given the nature of the publication which did not afford ml any alternative forum for addressing it reader it further recall that it is not evident that the applicant did or is likely to suffer any adverse consequence for not having paid for the publication of the retraction to date while he complained that the district administration had failed to return the book to the publishing house and that ml had published at his own expense a humiliating pseudoretraction the court doe not see any direct causal connection between these event and the wording of the disputed court order in view of the above the court considers that the applicant complaint concerning the court order to pay for publishing of a retraction is not substantiated neither doe the court find that the amount of compensation levied against the applicant uah wa a such excessive despite complaining that the amount had a disproportionate impact on his family budget the applicant did not disclose detail of it either in the domestic or in the convention proceeding it is also noteworthy that he in fact paid his judgment debt in monthly instalment amounting to of his retirement pension over an extended period of time in the absence of any more detailed information a to how this payment affected the applicant everyday life the court can not conclude that he suffered an excessive and disproportionate financial burden the court is mindful that a noted above the domestic court omitted responding directly to the applicant argument concerning his allegedly unimportant personal role in distributing the book and lack of evidence that the plaintiff prestige had in fact diminished a a result of his publication moreover none of the judgment given by the domestic court in the applicant case included express language indicating that they had acknowledged the existence of the conflicting right to reputation and freedom of expression in the case at issue which required striking a fair balance between them see eg aksu v turkey gc no and echr in this connection the court would reiterate the importance of an obligation to provide reason for decision concerning a restriction of the right to freedom of expression which offer an important procedural safeguard against arbitrary interference with this right see mutatis mutandis boldea cited above nur radyo ve televizyon yayıncılığı aş v turkey no no october cumhuriyet vakfı and others v turkey no october and ringier axel springer slovakia a v slovakia no no january however in the particular circumstance of the present case having established that the substantive conclusion reached by the domestic court concerning the defamatory nature of the statement submitted by the applicant for publication had not been arbitrary and the penalty imposed on him had not been excessive the court find that the absence of a more detailed reasoning for the above conclusion alone can not justify a finding that the interference wa not necessary in view of the above the court considers that it is not necessary to examine other argument adduced by the applicant and find that there ha been no violation of article of the convention in the present case iii other alleged violation of the convention the applicant also complained under article of protocol to the convention that his right during the enforcement of the judgment against him had been breached and that the district administration had acted unlawfully in taking the book from the publishing house not returning them in accordance with the court order of october and distributing them a they saw fit having cut out the page containing the disputed statement in addition he complained under article of the convention that he had had no effective remedy to complain about various element of purported procedural unfairness in the proceeding to which he wa a party and the allegedly unlawful conduct of various authority and cited article of the convention with respect to the fact of the present case having considered these complaint in the light of all the material in it possession the court find that in so far a the matter complained of are within it competence they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the right and freedom set out in the convention it follows that this part of the application must be declared inadmissible a being manifestly illfounded pursuant to article a and of the convention iv application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court find that there ha been a violation of the convention or the protocol thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party the applicant did not submit a claim for just satisfaction within the timelimit allotted to him for that purpose accordingly the court considers that there is no call to award him any sum on that account for these reason the court unanimously declares the complaint concerning the excessive length of the proceeding inadequate reasoning of the court judgment and restriction of the applicant freedom of expression admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible hold that there ha been a violation of article of the convention in respect of the length of the proceeding hold that ha been no violation of article of the convention in respect of the

museum had received le funding from public source than in the previous year the applicant contested that finding in his appeal to the domestic court see paragraph below criminal proceeding against the applicant on september the museum filed a private bill of indictment against the applicant accusing him of disseminating between december and july untrue information about the activity of the museum

irregularity in accounting bullying or inappropriate activity on the part of other employee the court which heard pś and other witness in respect of the above allegation made by the applicant found that the museum director had not been biased against the applicant furthermore the warsaw district court found that the impugned libel did not concern pś a a private person but rather the museum a an institution and it management for the court denunciation of a wrongful conduct should rely on fact and not only on bare value judgment of the person making such denunciation defamation could take the form of the accusation of a specific factual conduct or of the voicing of a general opinion about the action or the feature of an injured party on the fact the warsaw district court found that the applicant statement contained untrue allegation which had shed a bad light on the museum and it director irrespective of whether the applicant statement had resulted in the audit or had had any other negative consequence for the museum they had clearly put the museum at risk of losing it good reputation the applicant had not acted in good faith that is to say in defence of the museum interest he had acted with direct intent to damage the reputation of the museum and it management by making allegation which had not been objectively confirmed having worked long year at the museum the applicant had been perfectly aware of the untrue nature of his statement a for the fine the warsaw district court observed that it wa proportionate on the one hand to the harm caused by the applicant action and on the other hand to the applicant income to that end the court established that the applicant made pln per month and had no dependent person the applicant appealed arguing that the firstinstance court had erred in finding him to be the author of the letter in question and that by convicting him it had violated his human right on january the warsaw regional court sąd okręgowy upheld that judgment the judgment wa served on the applicant lawyer on april on an unspecified date the prosecutor general declined to grant the applicant request and to lodge a cassation appeal a in his view there were no ground for it civil proceeding against the applicant according to the applicant in the museum had also brought a civil claim against him seeking compensation for defamation the applicant further submitted that a civil court which wa bound by the finding of the criminal court in the proceeding against him partly allowed that claim and ordered the applicant to pay approximately pln eur in compensation and court fee relevant legal framework article of the criminal code provides a follows anyone who imputes to another person a group of person an institution a legal person or an

imposing sentence for an offence specified in paragraph or a court may award a supplementary payment to the injured person or the polish red cross or for another social purpose designated by the injured person nawiązka the prosecution of an offence specified in paragraph or may occur upon a private charge being brought the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that his criminal conviction constituted a disproportionate and unjustified sanction because criticising the professional activity of someone such a the museum director who wa a public figure had to be tolerated in a democratic society article of the convention read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility submission by the partiesa the government the government raised the following preliminary objection they argued that the application wa incompatible with article of the convention because firstly the applicant denied being the author of the impugned statement and secondly the statement were false and had been aimed at damaging the reputation of the museum in the government view the applicant had wanted to deflect article from it real purpose by using freedom of expression for private end namely libelling and defaming person with whom he had been in personal conflict the applicant had therefore abused the protection afforded to freedom of expression contrary to article of the convention the application wa thus incompatible ratione materiae within the meaning of article a of the convention relying on the same two argument a those detailed above the government also argued that the application should be declared inadmissible for abuse of the right of individual application within the meaning of article a of the convention they stressed that by signing the letter a the staff of the museum the applicant had tried to mislead the domestic court and had put third party at risk by falsely implying that they had been responsible for the impugned contentb the applicant the applicant submitted that despite denying being the author of the letter in question he enjoyed the protection of article of the convention because a domestic court had convicted him of libel having considered him to be the author article wa therefore applicable in the present case moreover the application should not be declared inadmissible for abuse of the right of individual application the mere fact that the applicant disagreed with certain version of fact of the case a presented by the domestic court or by the government did not mean that he had tried to mislead the court the court assessmenta a to the objection alleging incompatibility with article on the basis of the fact that the applicant denies having voiced the expression for which he wa convicted the court ha already held in some specific situation that the applicant who deny imparting any idea or information within the meaning of article of the convention may nevertheless enjoy the protection of that provision to that end in the case of müdür duman v turkey in which the applicant wa convicted of a serious offence of praising and condoning an act punishable by law on the basis of material found in the office of his political party the court observed that not accepting that the applicant criminal conviction constituted an interference on the ground that he had denied any involvement in the action at issue would be tantamount to requiring the applicant to acknowledge the act of which he had stood accused and would lock him in a vicious circle that would deprive him of the protection of the convention see müdür duman v turkey no october in addition requiring that the applicant acknowledges the act for which he stood accused would run counter to the right not to incriminate oneself which is part of international fair trial standard although not expressly mentioned in article of the convention ibid in the similar vein in the case of stojanović v croatia in which the applicant while not denying having given an interview argued that he had never used the particular word giving rise to his civil defamation case the court observed that in attributing the impugned statement to the applicant and ordering him to pay damage in respect of those statement the domestic court had indirectly stifled the exercise of his freedom of expression the court held that article of the convention wa applicable because if the applicant argument proved to be correct the damage he had been ordered to pay would have been likely to discourage him from making criticism of that kind in future see stojanović v croatia no september the court observes that in the present case the applicant criminal conviction for defamation wa indisputably directed at activity falling within the scope of freedom of expression a noted above and that the applicant wa sanctioned for engaging in such activity despite his denial of the authorship of the letter in question the court considers that in such circumstance the applicant conviction must similarly to the abovementioned case of müdür duman and stojanović be regarded a constituting an interference with his exercise of his right to freedom of expressionb a to the objection that the applicant had abused the protection of freedom of expression contrary to article of the convention the court will now examine the government objection that the view expressed by the applicant ran counter to the text and spirit of the convention and that he therefore could not under article of the convention rely on article a regard his impugned statement the court ha found that any remark directed against the convention underlying value is removed from the protection of article by article see mbala mbala v france dec no echr extract article is only applicable on an exceptional basis and in extreme case and should in case concerning article of the convention only be resorted to if it is immediately clear that the impugned statement sought to deflect this article from it real purpose by employing the right to freedom of expression for end clearly contrary to the value of the convention see perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extract the decisive point when assessing whether statement are removed from the protection of article by article is whether those statement are directed against the convention underlying value for example by stirring up hatred or violence or whether by making the statement the author attempted to rely on the convention to engage in an activity or perform act aimed at the destruction of the right and freedom laid down in it pastörs v germany no october in the case at hand the applicant wa convicted of making allegation about the mismanagement of public fund labour law infringement and various flaw in the organisation of a public museum of which the applicant wa an employee and it director although the manner in which the applicant acted may be considered objectionable in light of the court caselaw a referred to above the content of the impugned remark doe not justify the application of article of the convention in view of the above the court find that the applicant can not be deprived of the protection of article of the convention by article of the conventionc a to the objection that the applicant had abused of the right of individual application within the meaning of article a of the convention it remains for the court to examine the government objection that the applicant had abused the right of individual application because by denying being the author of the letter and by making false statement about the museum he had tried to mislead the domestic court and this court the court reiterates that an application may be rejected a abusive if among other reason it wa knowingly based on untrue fact see gross v switzerland gc no echr with further reference and pytel v poland no august with further reference incomplete and therefore misleading information may also amount to abuse of the right of application especially if the information concern the very core of the case and no sufficient explanation is given for the failure to disclose that information see gross cited above bestry v poland dec no november and hüttner v germany dec no june in principle any conduct on the part of an applicant that is manifestly contrary to the purpose of the right of individual application a provided for in the convention and which impedes the proper functioning of the court or the proper conduct of the proceeding before it can be considered a an abuse of the right of application see chim and przywieczerski v poland no april and miroļubovs and others v latvia no september the applicant intention to mislead the court must always be established with sufficient certainty see gross cited above with further reference in the present case the applicant while making his article complaint denied that he wa the author of written statement for which he had been convicted by the domestic court that in fact wa his line of defence before the criminal court in the light of it consideration in the case of müdür duman cited above see paragraph above the court find that the fact that the domestic court ultimately found on the basis of evidence that the applicant wa in fact the author of the statement in question doe not preclude the applicant from reiterating his original position before this court in any event for reason which the court ha already stated in paragraph above the core issue in the present case is not whether the domestic court had erred in finding the applicant responsible for the impugned statement but rather whether assuming that he wa the author the imposition of a criminal sanction on him for the offence of defamation wa justified under paragraph of article of the convention the court concludes from the above that there is no basis for finding that the applicant submitted untrue information concerning the very core of the case with the intention of misleading the court and thereby abused his right of individual petition the court further note that the application is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merit submission by the partiesa the applicant the applicant argued that the interference in his case had been unlawful in that article of the criminal code which had been the basis of his conviction for libel had reversed the burden of proof placing it on the defendant it thus required the applicant to prove that the person who had written the impugned letter had done so legitimately because his or her accusation were true the applicant not being the author of the statement in question had had no knowledge about their alleged false character moreover the applicant submitted that his application ought to be examined within the context of a whistleblower freedom to impart information the interference in his case had thus been unjustified and disproportionate within the meaning of paragraph of article of the convention to that end the applicant made the following observation the author of the letter in question had not acted out of any personal motivation or gain but in the public interest namely in order to ensure the lawful and rational management of public fund a respectful work environment and the preservation of the national heritage in the case of the museum those interest had in the author view been threatened by corruption work harassment the embezzlement of public fund and the mishandling of exhibit the author of the letter had denounced the shortcoming that a to his or her best knowledge had taken place at the museum in the absence of legislation concerning whistleblower at the material time the person in question had not had any alternative channel of bringing his or her suspicion to the attention of the authority concerned in the applicant opinion it would have been pointless to bring the issue to the attention of the museum director a the allegation had been made against that very person furthermore the applicant claimed that the author of the letter had had reasonable ground for fearing that the evidence would have been concealed or destroyed if he or she had first reported the issue to the museum management in the present case therefore it had clearly been impracticable for the person making the impugned statement to inform his or her superior of the suspicion still the author had chosen not to inform the public but had rather reported the alleged wrongdoing to the appropriate body that had had authority to examine the case the applicant also submitted that it would have been unreasonable to expect that citizen who otherwise were under a statutory duty to denounce wrongful act to prosecutor under article of the code of criminal procedure should only report situation which they were absolutely sure of and for which they had evidence after all it wa up to the police or other public authority to investigate the matter brought to their attention one should therefore not be prosecuted for denouncing a wrongful act in good faith such approach would have a chilling effect on the colleague of such a whistleblower the applicant also argued that in any event in the light of the result of the audit that had been carried out at the museum the statement made in the impugned letter might well have been considered true the applicant furthermore submitted that the domestic court had committed an error of fact a the applicant had not been the author of the letter the domestic court had also failed to examine the applicant case from the perspective of the protection of a whistleblower they had also disregarded several important element of the case namely the fact that i the impugned statement had been made in sealed anonymous letter the content of which had never been made public and ii the statement concerned a public institution and it director thus a public official who did not enjoy the same degree of protection of his private life or of his reputation a would a private person on that latter point the applicant submitted that the museum a a legal person and a public entity could not rely on the consideration of the right to respect for private life guaranteed by article of the convention that right wa after all inherently attributable to victim who were private and physical person it followed that in the applicant opinion the present application wa not about the balancing of two right that were equally protected by the convention lastly the applicant argued that the sanction that had been imposed on him had been completely disproportionate bearing in mind the fact that he had also been dismissed from work and ordered to compensate the museum in civil proceeding see paragraph and above the applicant also stressed that his conviction had deprived him of the possibility to work in his chosen profession elsewhereb the government the government argued that the interference in question had been justified under paragraph of article of the convention in particular the applicant statement had been anonymous and untrue and a such they could therefore not have gained the protection guaranteed to a whistleblower moreover the applicant had not wished to protect any common good rather he had acted with the sole aim of hurting his employer reputation the allegation that he had made had attained the requisite level of seriousness and could well have infringed on pś article right the national authority had therefore struck a fair balance between two equally important convention right that of the applicant freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the convention and that of protecting the reputation of the museum and it director a recognised by article of the convention the domestic court in adjudicating the applicant case had thoroughly analysed the abovementioned conflict of interest against the fact of the case those fact had been established on the basis of reliable and exhaustive evidence the sanction imposed on the applicant at the conclusion of the impugned criminal proceeding had been proportionate to the nature and the severity of his prohibited conduct and it consequence on the other hand in determining the level of the fine the domestic court had well taken into consideration the applicant financial situation the court assessmenta general principle the general principle regarding an assessment of whether an interference with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression wa necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention are wellsettled in the court caselaw they were restated in pentikäinen v finland gc no echr bédat v switzerland gc no march and summarised in perinçek cited above in addition it is to be reiterated that the court must ascertain whether the domestic authority struck a fair balance between the protection of freedom of expression a enshrined in article and the protection of the reputation of those against whom allegation have been made a right which a an aspect of private life is protected by article of the convention the relevant criterion that the court relies on to balance the right to freedom of expression against the right to respect for private life were recapitulated in perinçek cited above in particular the court reiterates that reputation is protected by article of the convention a part of the right to respect for private life see von hannover v germany no gc no and echr axel springer ag v germany gc no february couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no echr extract and perinçek cited above in order to fulfil it positive obligation to safeguard one person right under article the state may have to restrict to some extent the right secured under article for another person when examining the necessity of that restriction in a democratic society in the interest of the protection of the reputation or right of others the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authority struck a fair balance when protecting two value guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain case namely on the one hand freedom of expression a protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life a enshrined in article see bédat cited above in case which require the right to respect for private life to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression the court ha held that the outcome of the application in question should not in principle vary according to whether it ha been lodged with the court under article of the convention by the person who wa the subject of the statement in question or under article by the statement author these right deserve equal respect accordingly the margin of appreciation should in principle be the same in both situation see satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june moreover in such case the court would require strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see von hannover cited above when it come to the protection of the reputation of others the court ha made a distinction between defamation of natural and legal person the court ha nevertheless left open the question of whether the private life aspect of article protects the reputation of a company see firma edv für sie ef s elektronische datenverarbeitung dienstleistungs gmb h v germany dec no september on the other hand within the context of article the court ha considered that the protection of a university authority wa a mere institutional interest which did not necessarily have the same strength a the protection of the reputation or right of others within the meaning of article of the convention see kharlamov v russia no october on another occasion the court ha acknowledged that a company ha a right to defend itself against defamatory allegation and that a general interest exists in protecting company commercial viability and the wider economic good by limiting the damage caused by allegation which risked harming a company reputation see uj v hungary no july in spite of that the court still see a difference between the commercial reputational interest of a company and the reputation of an individual concerning his or her social status whereas the latter might have repercussion visàvis a person dignity for the court interest in respect of commercial reputation are devoid of that moral dimension ibid a the court ha affirmed with regard to the need to perform a balancing exercise between the right to reputation of a public institution with executive power and freedom of expression limit of permissible criticism are wider with regard to a public authority than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician in a democratic system the action or omission of a body vested with executive power must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authority but also of public opinion see mutatis mutandis şener v turkey no july lombardo and others v malta no april and margulev v russia no october the court ha also distinguished between assertion of fact and value judgment while the existence of fact can be demonstrated the truth of value judgment is not susceptible of proof at the same time where allegation are made about the conduct of a third party it may sometimes be difficult to distinguish between assertion of fact and value judgment see mutatis mutandis pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi in case of assertion of fact relying on the presumption of falsity and thus asking the author to demonstrate the truth of his or her assertion a required under the applicable criminal provision doe not necessarily contravene the convention see mutatis mutandis kasabova v bulgaria no april rumyana ivanova v bulgaria no and february makarenko v russia no december and rukaj v greece dec no january however an applicant clearly involved in a public debate on an important issue is required to meet a no more demanding standard than that of due diligence a in such circumstance an obligation to prove the factual statement may deprive him or her of the protection afforded by article see mutatis mutandis monica macovei v romania no july with further reference at the same time where an utterance amount to a value judgment the proportionality of the interference may depend on whether or not there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement since even a value judgment may be excessive if it ha no factual basis to support it the more serious such an allegation is the more solid the factual basis ha to be see de haes and gijsels v belgium february report of judgment and decision i and lewandowska malec v poland no and september b application of these principle to the casei whether there wa an interference a the court ha already stated above the applicant criminal conviction for libel constituted an interference with his exercise of his right to freedom of expression see paragraph aboveii whether the interference wa justified the impugned interference wa prescribed by law a required by article of the convention namely by article of the criminal code see dorota kania v poland no no october the applicant submission concerning the reversed burden of proof under that provision will be addressed by the court further below a it is a matter pertaining to the test of necessity in a democratic society see kasabova cited above the court furthermore accepts that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or right of others namely the good name of the museum a well a it director and other member of the management within the meaning of article of the convention see dorota kania no cited above it note that the interference further pursued the aim of ensuring the proper functioning of public institution thus the only point at issue is whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve that aimiii necessary in a democratic society in assessing the necessity of the interference it is important to examine the way in which the relevant domestic authority dealt with the case and in particular whether they applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article of the conventionα a to the denial of authorship the court note at the outset that the applicant denied being the author of the written statement which were attributed to him by the domestic authority and which are at the core of the present application see paragraph and above in the light of the material at hand the court can not however consider that the domestic court ha made a flagrant error of judgment on that point the question of whether the applicant wa the author of the letter in question wa duly addressed by the trial court of two level of jurisdiction moreover ample evidence comprising i two report by an expert in the forensic examination of document and ii the testimony of several witness wa adduced see paragraph above the court will thus proceed on the fair assumption that the applicant wa indeed the author of the impugned statement signed staff of the museum of hunting and equestrianism see paragraph aboveβ a to the relevance of the court caselaw in respect of the protection of whistleblower the court should next consider whether the applicant reporting could be qualified a argued by him a whistleblowing within the meaning of it caselaw in this connection the court observes at the outset that the statement in question see paragraph above may be described a allegation about the embezzlement of public fund corruption labour law infringement shortcoming in the organisation of the workplace and the mishandling of exhibit with the caveat that the full text of the impugned letter ha not been communicated to the court by the party or reproduced by the domestic court in wording of the relevant judgment it appears that the allegation described above were of a general nature likewise it is unknown whether the letter contained any specific request for an investigation into or verification of the allegation in the court view the general character of the impugned statement and the fact that they were strongly charged with the applicant value judgment undermines any seriousness of the irregularity that were being denounced in relation to the management and work condition in the museum the use of public fund and the preservation of national heritage contrast mutatis mutandis medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i palomo sánchez and others v spain gc no and others echr and boldea v romania no february the applicant who wa a civil servant did not have any privileged or exclusive access to or direct knowledge of the information contained in the letter see by contrast aurelian oprea v romania no january in fact before the domestic court the applicant specifically stated that he had not had access to the financial document of the museum and he did not know of incident involving mismanagement irregularity in accounting bullying or inappropriate activity on the part of other employee see paragraph in fine above thus with regard to the circumstance of the case it doe not seem that the applicant had secrecy or discretion duty with respect of his service and therefore his case can not be equated to any case of public disclosure of inhouse information in the public interest unlike a in the case of whistleblowing the applicant wa not in the position of being the only person or part of a small category of person aware of what wa happening at work and thus best placed to act in the public interest by alerting the employer or the public at large a contrario guja v moldova no february it is also unclear whether the applicant ha suffered any repercussion at his workplace a a consequence of the reporting of the alleged wrongdoing attributed to him a it would appear the applicant employment contract wa terminated in circumstance which are not directly linked to the libel incident in question see paragraph above and contrast guja cited above in view of these abovementioned factor the court doe not find that the letter in question can be deemed to constitute whistleblowing a defined by the court caselaw see bucur and toma v romania no january γ a to the third party affected the court observes that the allegation in question were in part personally directed at pś the museum director the letter were not phrased in any insulting or obscene language see paragraph and above see by contrast skałka v poland no may but in the court view they clearly affected the director other member of the management a well a the institution which they ran on the basis of the contextual examination of the extract of the disputed letter see paragraph and above the court find that the thrust of the impugned statement wa in equal measure to i accuse pś in his capacity of the museum director of conduct that appeared irregular or unlawful to the letter author and to ii notify the competent state authority thereof see also for the general principle governing the court evaluation of statement nikowitz and verlagsgruppe news gmb h v austria no february in this latter context the court ha indeed dealt with case involving defamation that had a bearing on an individual professional activity a doctor in kanellopoulou v greece no october the director of a statesubsidised company in tănăsoaica v romania no june and judge in belpietro v italy no september the present case however differs from the abovementioned case in that no legal action had been taken against the applicant by pś in a private capacity see paragraph and above on the other hand the balancing of the article and article right that wa carried out by the domestic court wa between on the one hand the applicant a the author of the statement and on the other hand the museum a a public entity pś and other member of it management see paragraph and above having regard to it caselaw see paragraph above the court concludes that given the circumstance of the case the value conflicting with the applicant freedom of speech that the domestic court wa called to balance were not of equal weight the protection of the museum good name being an institutional interest a opposed to a private concern should not have been considered a having the same degree of importance a the protection of pś and other member of the museum management which fall under the category of the protection of the reputation or right of others within the meaning of article of the convention moreover the limit of acceptable criticism of that institution management were wider than they would have been in relation to criticism of a private individualδ a to the audience targeted by the impugned statement the court accepts the applicant argument that in view of the fact that the allegation had concerned the museum director it would have been impracticable to report the issue to that person see paragraph above the court also observes that the information in question wa not revealed to the public but reported in private letter to those body that had authority to verify and if necessary to remedy the situation complained of see paragraph and above see also mutatis mutandis abovecited case of guja and and medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others and in such case the court ha considered that the requirement of such protection have to be weighed not in relation to the interest of the freedom of the press or of open discussion of matter of public concern but rather against the applicant right to report irregularity in the conduct of state official to a body competent to deal with such complaint see mutatis mutandis zakharov v russia no october kazakov v russia no december siryk v ukraine no march and marinova and others v bulgaria no and others july the court caselaw confirms that it is one of the precept of the rule of law that citizen should be able to notify competent state official about the conduct of public servant which to them appears irregular or unlawful see mutatis mutandis zakharov cited above kazakov cited above and siryk cited above at the same time the court note that even a letter distributed within a small community such a a public institution can inevitably harm the reputation and professional image of the person concerned see peruzzi v italy no june it can not be said that civil servant knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent to which politician do and should therefore be treated on an equal footing with the latter when it come to criticism of their action civil servant must enjoy public confidence in condition free of undue perturbation if they are to be successful in performing their task it may therefore prove necessary to protect them from offensive and abusive verbal attack in the course of their duty see peruzzi cited above see also janowski v poland gc no echr i and nikula v finland no echr ii by the same token civil servant should also be protected against abusive denunciationsε a to the consequence of the statement the court doe not lose from sight the fact that calumnious denunciation to the competent authority may result in investigating measure and may have very serious detrimental effect for the person concerned causing unnecessary stress and anxiety moreover calumnious denunciation mean that the competent investigating or audit authority can use more limited resource for the purpose of investigating or auditing other irregularity in the functioning of public authority the court ha no doubt that the impugned statement caused damage to the good name of the museum and called into question the management capacity of it director see paragraph and above it also caused damage to the museum a such the court also note that the preliminary criminal inquiry which wa at some point initiated and ultimately discontinued see paragraph in fine above had certainly an impact upon the museum director in that it had caused him anxiety and stress a to the consequence of the abovementioned accusation being passed on to the authority the court note that in a series of management and tax audit of the museum were carried out by various public institution see paragraph and above on the basis of the material at hand the court note that at least some of these audit had in fact been triggered by the impugned letter moreover a stated by the government and not effectively rebutted by the applicant a a consequence of the action attributed to the applicant the museum had received le funding see paragraph aboveστ a to the nature of the statement another important factor relevant for the balancing exercise in the present case is the nature of the utterance in the instant case the domestic court did not expressly determine to which category the statement attributed to the applicant belonged they did consider however that they were untrue that they had not been objectively confirmed and that they had been in fact disseminated in full knowledge of their falsehood with intent to harm the museum and it director see paragraph in fine and above a similar argument wa put forward by the government see paragraph above the court note that the author did not refer throughout the text of the impugned letter to specific date person or incident see mutatis mutandis kwiecień v poland no january he described in a general way the managerial shortcoming and the larger context in which they had allegedly occurred see paragraph above in particular the applicant accused pś of theft bullying the staff and using public fund for organising exhibition in the interest of private person at the same time part of the statement wa strongly charged with the author subjective feeling and emotion it appears therefore that the impugned utterance are a mix of assertion of fact and value judgment compare kaperzyński v poland no april bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii gąsior v poland no february dybek v poland dec no september and zybertowicz v poland no january the court observes that the author of the impugned statement wa a private individual and not a journalist medium or nongovernmental organisation with a public watchdog function contrast bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above and medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above a such the author wa not bound by the article duty and responsibility for example the obligation to provide accurate and reliable information or to verify factual statement if such statement were being made to the same extent a would have been required by the ethic of journalism see bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above and błaja news sp z o o v poland no november at the same time instead of contacting the authority overtly under his own name the applicant decided to send anonymous poisonpen letter the applicant explains that the intention behind sending the letter wa to help fighting corruption and other offence the court note in this context that the applicant allegation not only proved false but the applicant failed to adduce a sufficient factual basis to support his assertion of fact and value judgmentsζ a to the nature and severity of the penalty lastly the court reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are also factor to be taken into consideration when assessing the proportionality of the interference see ceylan v turkey gc no echr iv and malisiewicz gąsior v poland no april while the use of criminallaw sanction in defamation case is not in itself disproportionate the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are factor to be taken into account because they must not be such a to dissuade the press or others who engage in public debate from taking part in a discussion of matter of legitimate public concern see lewandowska malec cited above with further reference in the instant case the applicant wa criminally convicted a fine wa imposed on him in an amount equivalent to eur he wa also ordered to pay various cost amounting to eur see paragraph above the court observes that the criminal conviction must obviously have had negative consequence for the applicant career especially given the fact that he wa a civil servant seeking reemployment see mutatis mutandis heinisch v germany no july nevertheless the court find that the cumulative effect of in the circumstance of the present case the criminal conviction or the aggregate amount of the financial penalty could not be considered a having had a chilling effect on the exercise by the applicant of his freedom of expression in contrast with lewandowska malec cited above consequently the sanction imposed on the applicant doe not appear disproportionatec the court overall conclusion in the light of the above consideration the court find that in the case at hand the domestic court adduced sufficient and relevant reason to justify the interference with the applicant freedom of expression there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the courtdeclares unanimously the application admissible hold by five vote to two that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on december pursuant to rule and of the rule of court signature_p_ liv tigerstedt ksenija turkovićdeputy registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the separate opinion of judge felici and ktistakis is annexed to this judgment ktult dissenting opinion of judge felici and ktistakiswe regret that we are unable to agree with the majority of the court that the applicant criminal conviction which resulted in the imposition of a fine wa compatible with article of the convention for the reason stated below the applicant denounced by mean of private letter see paragraph of the judgment sent exclusively to competent state authority the tax office the supreme audit office the regional prosecutor and the president office matter relating to financial and employment shortcoming on the part of his employer a state museum and the director of that museum thus the objective condition of the criminal offence of defamation are not fulfilled in that the impugned statement could not if only because of their private character lower the standing in the public opinion or undermine public confidence article of the polish criminal code see of the judgment it follows that the restriction on the applicant freedom of expression wa not provided for in the national criminal law further the restriction did not serve a legitimate aim first the aim of ensuring the proper functioning of public institution see paragraph of the judgment is not a such one of the legitimate aim exhaustively listed in article of the convention see catan and others v the republic of moldova and russia gc no and others echr extract furthermore the aim of preserving the good name of the museum of hunting and equestrianism see paragraph and of the judgment can not be considered a part of the protection of the reputation or right of others when issue of financial and employment transparency within the publiclaw legal entity in question were raised exclusively and privately before the competent state authority the present case differs from the court relevant caselaw about university where the issue of concern concerned exclusively academic professional standard and were raised in public see kharlamov v russia no october sorguç v turkey no june and kula v turkey no june finally the aim of protection of the right of others namely the good name of the director of the museum and of the other member of the management see paragraph and of the judgment is not fulfilled in the present case because the director and the other member of the management board were not a party to the impugned criminal proceeding and they never brought any civil action against the applicant see paragraph finally with regard to the proportionality of the restriction on the applicant freedom of expression the court caselaw attache considerable importance to the audience targeted by the impugned statement see for example grigoriades v greece november report of judgment and decision vii kazakov v russia no december and sofranschi v moldova no december a mentioned at the beginning of our opinion the applicant addressed his complaint by way of private correspondence only to the competent state official and did not make them known to the general public we consider that this element is crucial in assessing the proportionality of the interference in our view citizen should be able to notify at least privately competent state official about the conduct of civil servant which to them appears irregular or unlawful because this is one of the precept of the rule of law see zakharov v russia no october bezymyannyy v russia no april and lešník v slovakia no echr iv in consequence we conclude that the restriction on the applicant freedom of expression wa not necessary in a democratic society,,,
20,the applicant wa born in and life in vienna he is of bulgarian origin on july a letter signed by the applicant wa sent to the sofia municipality in that letter the applicant complained of construction work undertaken by his nephew ak which had significantly altered the house which had been owned by his parent and where he had been born the applicant had become aware of that during his stay in sofia in may he expressed his indignation about the work undertaken a well a doubt a to their legality and requested to be sent copy of all document concerning them stating that he intended to bring the matter to court he stated in addition that ak held for the property in question an illegal notarial deed acquired on the basis of a forged notarial deed these allegation concerned the notarial deed of and described in paragraph below ak had been the beneficiary under both of them the applicant indicated an intention to challenge these deed in court in december ak initiated a private criminal prosecution of the applicant in his complaint he stated that he had become aware of the applicant letter by chance and claimed that the applicant had defamed him in particular by stating that he had an illegal notarial deed acquired on the basis of a forged notarial deed this implied that ak had committed a criminal offence namely using a forged document in the same proceeding ak also brought a tort action against the applicant claiming bulgarian lev bgn the equivalent of euro eur in nonpecuniary damage the applicant objected to the complaint against him contending that what he had stated wa true and that he had never claimed that ak had actually used the forged document in a decision of the sofia district court of october the criminal prosecution of the applicant wa discontinued a timebarred and the examination of the case continued only a regard ak tort action that action wa allowed in a judgment of the sofia district court of january the domestic court stated expressly in that judgment that it did not have to establish the element of the criminal offence of defamation it had to establish in accordance with section of the obligation and contract act see paragraph below whether the applicant behaviour amounted to a tortious act and whether ak had suffered any damage a a result a to the fact of the case the sofia district court established that ak had become the owner of part of the property at issue after his mother had donated to him a share in and he had purchased another share from a coowner in both transaction had been attested in notarial deed in a further notarial deed of ak had been recognised a the owner of part of the property in he had obtained a permit to enlarge the existing house the construction work had been carried out in and a representative of the building control authority had visited the site on july and had established breach of the relevant rule but no administrative sanction had been ordered against ak an additional check had been carried out on november after one of the coowners of the property not the applicant had complained that check had showed that part of the construction work undertaken by ak did not correspond to the construction permit it appears however that ak had not been ordered to demolish the unlawfully constructed part further complaint by the coowners concerning the construction undertaken by ak had been sent to the municipality on may the sofia district court heard in addition witness who said that following the applicant allegation against him ak had become nervous and had had unspecified problem with the authority the sofia district court found that it had never been shown that the notarial deed in ak favour had been flawed meaning that they had to be considered valid the applicant allegation that one of these deed had been illegal and another one forged could have affected ak good name in society a they suggested that ak had profited from using unlawful mean those allegation had also damaged ak professional reputation since he wa working in construction this wa so even bearing in mind that the municipal authority had taken no particular action against ak and that check on the construction site had been incited by other coowners of the property the above consideration were valid regardless of whether the applicant had committed the criminal offence of defamation since this wa not the subject of the proceeding the applicant had had resort to his constitutional right to petition the authority but the exercise of that right did not have to involve causing damage to others the sofia district court ordered the applicant to pay ak bgn the equivalent of eur in nonpecuniary damage plus default interest it considered such an award to be just pointing out that ak had enjoyed a good name in society that the applicant allegation had also affected ak professional reputation and that the allegation had been made before a municipal body and not in private correspondence upon an appeal by the applicant in a final judgment of august the sofia city court upheld the district court judgment endorsing it reasoning the applicant ha not submitted document showing that he actually paid the amount awarded to ak nor ha he claimed to have made any such payment ii relevant domestic law and practice article of the constitution of provides that citizen have the right to make complaint proposal and petition to the authority article of the criminal code criminalises defamation the offence and the relevant domestic practice concerning it have been described in marinova and others v bulgaria no and others and july section of the obligation and contract act provides that everyone is obliged to make good the damage which they have through their fault caused to another by article of the code of criminal procedure the criminal court is obliged to rule on a civil claim that ha already been accepted for examination in the criminal proceeding even after the associated criminal prosecution ha become timebarred or the accused ha been acquitted according to the supreme court of cassation the criminal court ha to rule on a civil claim even where it can not rule on the criminal liability of the accused because civil liability stem from a tortious act and not from a criminal offence тълкувателно решение от г на вкс по тълк д г оснк решение от г на вкс по н д г i н о нкthe lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that after having complained to the authority he had been found liable to pay damage to ak for defamation article of the convention read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court note that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit argument of the party the government contended that the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression had been in compliance with the requirement of article in particular it had been lawful since the relevant provision of the criminal code were clear and accessible and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation of others moreover the interference had been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued for the following reason the applicant criminal prosecution had been discontinued and the criminal court had only examined ak civil claim against him the applicant had not been a journalist or a whistleblower nor had ak been a public official which meant that the authority had owed no special protection to the applicant and ak had not been obliged to tolerate criticism the applicant had made a statement of fact not a value judgment and had not proven the veracity of the fact alleged those fact were such that they could have affected ak reputation the damage ordered against the applicant had not been excessive the award of damage had been made in adversarial proceeding and the domestic court had given sufficient reason for their decision the applicant pointed out that his letter had aimed to trigger a check by the authority on possible irregularity and argued that being held liable on that ground had been contrary to the principle of democracy and could dissuade potential future complainant he contested in addition many of the domestic court finding a to the fact of the case the court assessment the general principle developed in the court caselaw concerning freedom of expression have recently been summarised in morice v france gc no echr and medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june turning to the case at hand the court observes that the court decision finding the applicant liable to pay damage to ak amounted to an interference with his right to freedom of expression under article of the convention in previous case against bulgaria under article of the convention concerning complaint addressed to the authority and where the applicant had been convicted of defamation in criminal proceeding the court expressed doubt a to the lawfulness of the interference with their right these were based on the fact that the applicant had not disseminated injurious statement while the dissemination wa an requisite element of the offence of defamation a interpreted by the former bulgarian supreme court and the current supreme court of cassation the applicant case had not reached the supreme court of cassation so that it could authoritatively rule on the matter however the court decided that it did not have to pronounce on the question of lawfulness since it considered that the interference with the applicant right were in any event disproportionate see marinova and others no and others july zdravko stanev v bulgaria no no july sapundzhiev v bulgaria committee no september in the present case similarly to the one cited in the previous paragraph the proceeding against the applicant were initially concerned with his criminal liability for defamation however his criminal prosecution subsequently became timebarred and the domestic court did not seek to establish whether the applicant had committed the criminal offence of defamation they only examined the civil claim brought by ak in the same proceeding see paragraph and above in view thereof the court see no reason to call into question the lawfulness of the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression a it did in the case cited in the previous paragraph on the ground of any failure of the domestic court to establish the element of the criminal offence of defamation the interference wa based on section of the obligation and contract act see paragraph and above the court find therefore that the interference with the applicant right wa prescribed by law a required under article of the convention the court considers furthermore that the interference pursued a legitimate aim namely the protection of the reputation and right of ak the salient question is whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society that is to say whether it corresponded to a pressing social need whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason given by the national authority were relevant and sufficient see among others janowski v poland gc no echr i the applicant wa found civilly liable for having stated that ak wa in possession of an illegal notarial deed acquired on the basis of a forged notarial deed see paragraph above the court see no reason to question the domestic court finding of fact in that regard namely that the applicant had made that statement and that it wa untrue moreover even if it acknowledges that the impugned statement wa not particularly aggressive denigrating or insulting and note that no adverse practical consequence for ak such a check or inspection on the part of the authority stemmed from the applicant letter the court is not to question the national court conclusion that ak nevertheless suffered some damage a a result that conclusion wa based in particular on witness testimony and appears to be adequately reasoned see paragraph above the applicant wa found civilly liable for one particular statement contained in his letter of july namely a mentioned above that ak wa in possession of an illegal notarial deed acquired on the basis of a forged notarial deed see paragraph above that statement wa addressed to the sofia municipality but that local authority wa not competent to verify such a matter or take any measure the applicant said in his letter that he intended to challenge ak notarial deed in court which wa indeed the authority competent to resolve the matter but ha not shown that he took any action in that regard accordingly it can not be said that the applicant wa found liable for having made before an authority a complaint the latter wa competent to deal with contrast marinova and others and sapundzhiev both cited above on the contrary it would appear that in making the impugned statement the applicant deliberately sought to harm his nephew the statement at issue wa not made impulsively or in the heat of a discussion but wa sent to the authority about two month after the applicant had visited sofia and had become aware of the construction undertaken by his nephew see paragraph above it is also significant that no sanction wa imposed to the applicant with regard to the remaining statement in his letter of july in particular that he wa indignant about the work undertaken by his nephew and that he had doubt a to their legality in addition the applicant did not make allegation of misconduct against a public official with regard to whom the limit of acceptable criticism would have been wider contrast marinova and others cited above for the reason above the court find that the interference with the applicant freedom of expression corresponded to a pressing social need a mentioned above it note furthermore that in finding the applicant civilly liable for having made the impugned statement the domestic court gave relevant and sufficient reason a to the sanction imposed on the applicant the court observes that the criminal prosecution against him became timebarred and he wa only found civilly liable the applicant wa ordered to pay to ak a sum equivalent to eur plus default interest see paragraph above the applicant ha not submitted detail on his personal financial situation and the court is unable to ass whether such an award against him wa excessive and imposed on him a disproportionate burden furthermore the applicant doe not appear to have actually paid any part of that sum see paragraph above nor ha it been claimed that ak ha attempted to obtain such a payment moreover seeing that a noted above the case did not concern a complaint by the applicant to an authority competent to deal with it it can not be said that the finding of the applicant civilly liable risked having the effect of stifling potential future complaint contrast sapundzhiev cited above having regard to the above the court concludes that the interference with the applicant freedom of expression wa necessary in a democratic society and thus met the requirement of article of the convention there ha accordingly been no violation of article for these reason the court unanimously declares the application admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on may pursuant to rule and of the rule of court claudia westerdiek angelika

russia granny on an unspecified date prior to november the applicant had uploaded an audio file containing a song called glory to russia performed by kolovrat a music band the video lasted for one minute and showed a young man approaching an elderly woman who wa played by a man they engaged in a dialogue in the russian language for a full description of the content see annex to the present judgment russia is a socalled mockumentary also in russian directed by pavel bardin about neo nazi skinhead in russia the plot of the film came from the imagination of the author but the imaginary story wa based on life in russia in the film member of a gang called russia are filming propaganda video to post on the internet after a while they become accustomed to the camera and stop paying attention to it the leader of the gang discovers that his sister is dating a southern caucasian man this family drama develops into a tragedy the film ha no closing credit but a list of people killed by skinhead in russia in at the end playing over silence the film wa screened at the berlin international film festival director pavel bardin won the discovery of the year nika award for the film according to the applicant the piece wa also shown on russian television channel the audio file contained a musical composition glory to russia with lyric in the russian language see annex to the present judgment criminal proceedi ng against the applicantinvestigation on an unspecified date and in unspecified circumstance the applicant or the relevant vk account came to the attention of the russian authority in november the authority created a vk account and sent a friend request to the roman kilin account after the request had been accepted the authority gained access to the content that included the impugned video see paragraph above fortyseven people who had also been added a the account friend had similar access see also paragraph and below later on the authority also examined through their vk account the impugned audio file see paragraph above in september the regional office of the federal security service initiated criminal proceeding against the applicant his home wa searched and his personal computer wa seized in september the investigator commissioned a linguistic and psychological assessment of the impugned material by official of the kemerovo state university the dean of the faculty of social and psychological study and the deputy chair of the unit of stylistics and rhetoric on november they issued their report see paragraph below concerning the video they made the following findingsa linguist the video wa a part of a wellknown feature film russia and wa a selfcontained clip in term of it content it showed a negative encounter between an elderly woman and azerbaijani soured because of a lack of honesty and decency implying that azerbaijani vendor fooled their client and thereby putting forward a negative image of people of azerbaijani ethnicity the video did not refer to any specific person the negative image wa not personified thus the video showed a negative image of the entire ethnic group the video contained two call put forward by the elderly woman look maybe it is better to beat the shit out of all those blackies and to throw them throw them out of moscow well the holy cause is not tricky she take a bat in her hand the first two indirect call were strengthened by the last one emphasising the positive assessment of the suggested action a well a by the ensuing actual conduct consisting in the beating up of non russian people presumably of azerbaijani origin in view of the context of the video the last call here is how russian must fight for their right is demonstrated by the use of the word must and fight the expert concluded that the video contained a call to violence aimed at inciting discord between russian and azerbaijani a call to beat them with a bat a well a a call to violence aimed at violating their right a call to throw them out of moscowb psychologist the overall context of the russia film meant that it author aimed in the impugned part to show the tool and method of manipulative impact on the part of nationalist organisation and by implication to strengthen the protection of the individual and mass consciousness against such manipulation however when taken out of context that part acquired a different meaning by posting it a separate material that is to say without regard to and in isolation from the author intended message the person concerned pursued his or her own message the video created a negative image of people of azerbaijani origin by attributing to them deceitful and indecent action while omitting to make any disclaimer or reservation thus this image wa intended to relate to the entire ethnic group in opposition to a russian woman who could not be deceptive and thus had to stay away from the market taken over by azerbaijani the video then demonstrated the action to be taken namely physical assault against them and their removal from moscow such action were presented a positive and were approved of a a holy cause and the way russian had to fight for their right a to the audio they concluded a followsa linguist the content of the song opposed russian and non russian who were called blackies черные in modern russian this word wa used a a pejorative in respect of the people of certain race or ethnic origin asian black or from the caucasus they were presented in the song a enemy that russian had to fight against the nationalist tone of the song followed from the use of patriotic trope the fact that it wa directed toward russian the solicitation of the support of other slavic people the use of the notion of our kind the non russian were depicted a dangerous the song contained several call the blackie shit must be thrown out of russia the use of the word must come on guy let put on our bomber jacket and boot a call to get military clothing on let shout loud glory to russia and we will fight the expert concluded that the song contained a call to violence aimed at inciting discord between russian and non russian a call to fight against them a well a a call to violence aimed at violating their right a call to throw them out of russiab psychologist the message of the song author and the person who had posted it in the internet coincided the song contained a very negative depiction of non russian together with insulting and emotional adjective while omitting to make any disclaimer or reservation thus the content concerned all non russian ethnic group they were attributed a dominant position in russia thus the content wa aimed at inciting ethnic discord between ethnic russian and those of another ethnicity the content also contained expression calling for a fight to not give up and to win meaning violence against non russian with the aim of throwing them out of russia trial the applicant stood trial before a justice of the peace the justice of the peace held a public hearing the applicant denied that he had been the user of the vk account roman kilin according to him at the time of the criminal proceeding against

quashed the justice of the peace judgment considering that it did not properly describe the fact held against the applicant having reexamined the case the appellate court considered that by posting the impugned video and audio in his vk account the applicant had realised that it had been possible for them to be accessed by an unlimited number of people and had acted with the intent to incite ethnic discord национальная рознь and to incite others to commit violation of the right and freedom of people of non russian ethnicity нерусские национальности between june and november he had made public call to carry out extremist activity in the appellate court view the video and the audio contained call to violent action aimed at inciting ethnic discord between russian and people of other ethnicity and aimed at violating their right and freedom specifically the impugned video contained call to violent action with the aim of inducing ethnic discord between russian and people of

hobby which helped in acquiring new friend among the website user the court concluded that in view of those consideration the information contained in a vk account wa widely accessible to an unlimited number of people in reaching those conclusion the appellate court referred to the witness statement made before the justice of the peace and some other witness statement made before the justice of the peace which had not been however assessed in the firstinstance judgment mr p a deputy dean at the kemerovo state medical university stated that he had examined the impugned video and audio which had been available at the applicant account he had asked the applicant why he had posted that content the latter replied that he had posted it some six month before when he had been interested in national idea another witness mr b stated that he had asked a similar question and that the applicant replied that he had posted it just like that that is for no particular reason mr t the applicant secondaryschool classmate stated that until late the applicant webpage had been open and that he had examined the impugned material mr s apparently a lawenforcement officer stated that in november the authority had created a vk account and sent a friend request without any further explanation to the roman kilin account after the request had been accepted the authority had gained access to the content that had included the impugned video fortyseven people had had similar access a they had also been added a the account friend the appellate court stated that in addition to those statement the applicant guilt wa confirmed by some other evidencea it followed from the report issued by linguist and psychologist see paragraph above that the communicative intention of the author of the russia film had been to uncover the mean and method used by nationalist organisation to psychologically manipulate others and thereby to reinforce individual and societal protection against such harmful influence when disseminating the video the person concerned the applicant had aimed at inciting ethnic discord and at violent and other action aiming at violating the right and freedom of people of

between the applicant and a woman in which the applicant had stated well shoot them down and russia for russian in the context referring to people of non russian ethnicityc a to article of the criminal code call to extremist activity could be expressed orally in writing or through another form for instance in audio or video work the fact that the person who disseminated publicly such material wa not it author did not mean that the call to extremist activity did not emanate from that person by intentionally disseminating such material that person expressed his or her endorsement or approval and intended that others would be receptive to the call contained in the impugned material thus that person had to be held a personally wanting to incite others to carry out an extremist activityd by adding information to a personal vk account the applicant had to realise that such information became accessible to other registered vk user and wanted that outcome psychologically with the aim of acquiring new friend among user by way of sharing his personal data hobby and interestse unlike disseminating extremist material which wa an offence under the code of administrative offence

required to regularly report to the authority supervising the execution of sentence and wa not allowed to change the place of residence or his educational institutional without notifying that

classified a extremist material under the suppression of extremism act a quotation from that work of art could not be perceived or classified in a criminal case a calling for extremist activitiesc the appellate court had not established any call to extremist activity on the part of the applicant a required under article of the criminal code instead he had in substance been convicted of disseminating extremist material which wa an offence under article of the code of administrative offencesd there had been no valid reason under article of the code of criminal procedure to hold the appeal hearing in camera on november the regional court upheld the appeal decision of august the regional court decision did not specify whether a public hearing had been held however it stated a follows having examined at the hearing on november the cassation appeal statement submitted by the applicant lawyer and having heard the opinion expressed by the applicant and his lawyer and the prosecutor the court ha decided a follows indeed the appeal court decided under article of the code of criminal procedure to hold the hearing in camera and issued a related decision providing the reason in it it follows from the material in the case file that the justice of the peace held a public hearing at which the evidence submitted by the party wa examined the defence did not appeal against the decision to hold the appeal hearing in camera and in their cassation appeal ha not submitted convincing argument to the effect that the appeal hearing in camera significantly impinged upon

give the exact factual circumstance on which that decision had been based such a decision could concern the entire proceeding or a part thereof it follows from ruling no of december by the plenary supreme court that a violation of the rule relating to a public hearing in a criminal case may justify the quashing of the relevant judgment where such a violation entailed or could entail taking an unlawful nonreasoned or unfair judgment paragraph other material on december the council of europe european commission against racism and intolerance ecri adopted general policy recommendation no on combating hate speech for relevant summary see among others atamanchuk v russia no february and karastelev and others v russia no october the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that his criminal conviction had violated article of the convention which in the relevant part read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others admissibility the government argued that the complaint had to be declared incompatible ratione materiae with reference to article of the convention the applicant had posted material that incited ethnic hatred and discrimination the applicant made no comment article of the convention read a follows nothing in the convention may be interpreted a implying for any state group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the right and freedom set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the convention the court reiterates that the effect of article of the convention is to negate the exercise of the convention right that the applicant seek to vindicate in the proceeding before the court see perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extract article is only applicable on an exceptional basis and in extreme case and should in case concerning article of the convention only be resorted to if it is immediately clear that the impugned statement sought to deflect this article from it real purpose by employing the right to freedom of expression for end clearly contrary to the value of the convention see perinçek cited above and pastörs v germany no october the decisive point when assessing whether the statement are removed from the protection of article by article is whether those statement were directed against the convention underlying value or whether by making the statement the author attempted to rely on the convention to engage in an activity or perform act aimed at the destruction of the right and freedom laid down in it this point however is not immediately clear in the present case and overlap with the question whether there wa an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression and whether this interference wa necessary in a democratic society thus the court find that the question whether article is to be applied must be joined to the merit of the complaint under article of the convention see perinçek cited above the court also note that this complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merit the party submission the applicant argued that article of the convention did not allow criminal prosecution on account of one expression of sympathy toward certain information or idea expressed in an excerpt of a cinematographic work in particular where such information or idea had not been banned on the national level subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb one could not be held criminally liable for posting a part of a work of art which had not been banned in the respondent state in any event the applicant had not posted the impugned material in convicting him the russian court exceeded their discretion and thus the interference wa not necessary in a democratic society the government stated that the criminal conviction amounted to an interference with the applicant freedom of expression however it wa prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity and public safety a well a for preventing disorder and crime and protecting the right of others the applicant conviction wa a proportionate reaction on the part of the state with the aim of limiting access of other people to aggressive discriminatory or provocative statement the court assessmenta interference the applicant wa convicted for making thirdparty content available for access to others using an account on a socialnetworking website both at the national level and before the court the applicant denied that he had been the user of the relevant vk account and alleged that the impugned video and audio had been published on it by others firstly the court considers that the applicant criminal conviction for the offence of public call to extremist activity punishable under article of the criminal code wa directed at activity falling within the scope of freedom of expression a protected by article of the convention the court reiterates in this connection that owing to it accessibility and capacity to store and communicate vast amount of information the internet ha now become one of the principal mean by which individual exercise their right to freedom of expression and information the internet provides essential tool for participation in activity and discussion concerning political issue and issue of general interest it enhances the public access to news and facilitates the dissemination of information in general article of the convention guarantee everyone the freedom to receive and impart information and idea it applies not only to the content of information but also to the mean of it dissemination for any restriction imposed on the latter necessarily interferes with that freedom see ahmet yıldırım v turkey no echr for instance the court ha previously stated that the prosecution for posting a hyperlink to defamatory material online amounted to an interference under article of the convention see magyar jeti zrt v hungary no december second the court reiterates that where an applicant argues that by attributing to him statement he had never made and convicting him in relation to those statement the domestic court indirectly stifled the exercise of his freedom of expression he may rely on the protection of article of the convention see stojanović v croatia no september to hold otherwise would be tantamount to requiring him to acknowledge the act of which he stood accused it should be borne in mind in this connection that the right not to incriminate oneself although not specifically mentioned in article of the convention is a generally recognised international standard which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under that provision see müdür duman v turkey no october and zülküf murat kahraman v turkey no july in the present case the applicant chose to remain silent during the domestic proceeding he maintained the same position before the court at the same time both at national level and before the court he put forward an alternative line of argument consisting in substance in challenging the compliance of his prosecution with article of the convention having said this the court find no reason to disagree with the domestic court finding that the applicant used the vk account retained exclusive access to it and made accessible the impugned material using it the court will therefore proceed on the assumption that there ha been an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression under article of the conventionb justification of the interference to the extent that the applicant may rely on article of the convention see paragraph and above such interference infringes article of the convention unless it satisfies the requirement of paragraph of that provision it ha to be determined whether the interference wa prescribed by law pursued one or more legitimate aim a defined in that paragraph and wa necessary in a democratic society to achieve those aimsi prescribed by law the court note that the applicant prosecution had a basis in article of the criminal code read together with section of the suppression of extremism act see paragraph and above in his observation the applicant raised no specific argument suggesting that those provision of russian law had not been complied with including that their application to him had not been foreseeable thus the court considers that the interference wa prescribed by lawii legitimate aim it is with reference to the government submission and foremost on account of the related domestic finding on the necessity of the interference in pursuance of a legitimate aim or at least of the rationale for the underlying legislative framework that the court would take a stance on the relevant legitimate aim see pt v the republic of moldova no may when referring to a legitimate aim the government must demonstrate that in acting to penalise an applicant the domestic authority had that legitimate aim in mind compare perinçek cited above in relation to the government assertion in that case on the legitimate aim of preventing disorder the government argued that the applicant conviction had been in the interest of national security territorial integrity and public safety a well a for preventing disorder and crime and protecting the right of others see paragraph above the court note that the applicant conviction concerned call for violent action aimed at i inciting discord between russian and people of other ethnicity in particular azerbaijani and ii violating the latter right and freedom because of their ethnicity the court is not satisfied that the interest of national security territorial integrity and public safety were shown to be pertinent in the present case the court considers however that the applicant criminal prosecution can be regarded a having been intended for the prevention of disorder and crime and for the protection of the right of others within the meaning of article of the convention specifically the dignity of people of non russian ethnicity in particular azerbaijani ethnicity in aksu v turkey gc no and and echr the court observed that discrimination on account of inter alia a person ethnicity is a form of racial discrimination racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and in view of it perilous consequence requires from the authority special vigilance and a vigorous reaction the court also held inter alia that negative stereotyping of an ethnic group wa capable when reaching a certain level of having an impact on the group sense of identity and on it member feeling of selfworth and selfconfidence ibid see also lewit v austria no and october and atamanchuk v russia no and february in the court view incitement of discord between ethnic group through call to violence may be prejudicial to all the group involved and other sector of the populationiii necessary in a democratic society it remains to be determined whether the criminal conviction wa necessary in a democratic society in the pursuance of those legitimate aimsα general principle the court reiterates that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article of the convention it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society a enshrined in article freedom of expression is subject to exception which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly see satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation what the court ha to do is inter alia to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether the national authority adduced relevant and sufficient reason to justify it including whether they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see bédat v switzerland gc no march β application of the principle in the present case the applicant wa given a suspended sentence of eighteen month imprisonment for making thirdparty content one video recording and one audio recording available for access through an account on a socialnetworking website a the criminal court adjudged in his case by doing so the applicant made public call to i ethnic discord through recourse to violence against member of non russian ethnic group in russia in particular people of the azerbaijani ethnic origin a regard the video and ii violating their right and freedom on account of their ethnicity also through recourse to violence against them in the assessment of the interference with freedom of expression in case of this type alongside the general principle formulated in the court caselaw under article of the convention see perinçek cited above various factor may prove to be pertinent and have to be taken into account including the social and political background against which the statement were made whether the statement fairly construed and seen in their immediate or wider context can be seen a a direct or indirect call to violence or a a justification of violence hatred or intolerance the manner in which the statement were made and their capacity direct or indirect to lead to harmful consequence ibid it is the interplay between the various factor rather than any of them taken in isolation that determines the outcome of a particular case ibid including where the balance had to be struck between freedom of expression and the right of others ibid and the court ha previously taken into account the intention of or the purpose being pursued by the applicant in particular where that consideration had formed part of the criminal court reasoning see jersild v denmark september and series a no féret v belgium no july perinçek cited above stomakhin v russia no and may pastörs v germany no october and atamanchuk cited above and for example the fact that the author of controversial statement acted without a racist motive see perinçek or intention to incite hatred or violence or a fortiori that the purpose of disseminating such statement wa to denounce or expose racist or intolerant view see jersild ha been treated by the court a a relevant factor for assessing whether the applicant criminal conviction were convincingly shown to have been necessary in a democratic society under article of the convention that consideration is particularly relevant for applying article of the convention in case where conversely by making the statement the applicant attempted to rely on the convention to engage in an activity or perform act aimed at the destruction of the right and freedom laid down in it see pavel ivanov v russia dec no february and belkacem v belgium dec no june rather than for instance at contributing to a debate on a matter of public interest in this connection the court ha also taken note of ecris position that in some instance a particular feature of the use of hate speech is that it may be intended to incite or can reasonably be expected to have the effect of inciting others to commit act of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those targeted by it the element of incitement entail there being either a clear intention to bring about the commission of act of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination or an imminent risk of such act occurring a a consequence of the particular hate speech used intent to incite might be established where there is an unambiguous call by the person using hate speech for others to commit the relevant act or it might be inferred from the strength of the language used and other relevant circumstance such a the previous conduct of the speaker however the existence of intent may not always be easy to demonstrate particularly where remark are ostensibly concerned with supposed fact or coded language is being used see paragraph above in the court view the applicant wa prosecuted in relation to the type of incitement mentioned above and his conviction wa based on the consideration that his action had been intended to incite violence article of the criminal code did not appear to require any assessment of a risk of harmful consequence it being sufficient to establish a defendant direct intent and his or her actual aim to incite to call others to carry out extremist activity that is in the present case to induce ethnic discord and to violate the right of people of non russian ethnicity both by way of violent action against them see paragraph above the finding of guilt wa based on two considerationsa the finding that the thirdparty content contained call to violence aiming at inciting ethnic discord and at violating right and freedom of non russian ethnic group because of their ethnicity andb a number of indication relating to the applicant attitude toward that content the applicant choosing to remain silent during the criminal proceeding to ass the weight of one interest in the exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression the court must first examine the nature of his or her statement see perinçek cited above the relevant question is whether the statement belonged to a type of expression entitled to heightened or reduced protection under article of the convention which is ultimately for the court to decide while having regard to the finding of the domestic court in this regard see for instance satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above bédat cited above and herbai v hungary no november under the court caselaw expression on matter of public interest is in principle entitled to stronger protection whereas expression that promotes or justifies violence hatred xenophobia or another form of intolerance can not normally claim protection see perinçek the risk of harm posed by content and communication on the internet to the exercise and enjoyment of human right and freedom may be higher than that posed by the press a unlawful speech including hate speech and call to violence can be disseminated a never before worldwide in a matter of second and sometimes remain persistently available online see delfi a v estonia gc no and echr at the same time the reach and thus potential impact of a statement released online with a small readership or a the case may be online followership on socialmedia platform and a statement published on mainstream or highly visited web page may differ it may be pertinent for the assessment of a potential influence of an online publication to determine the scope of it reach to the public see savva terentyev v russia no august the court also considers that the sharing of thirdparty content online through socialmedia platform is a frequent way of communication and social interaction and that it doe not always pursue any specific communicative aim or aim especially where a person doe not accompany it with any comment or otherwise signify his or her attitude toward the content the court doe not exclude that such act of sharing certain content still can contribute to an informed citizenry in the domestic proceeding the applicant chose to remain silent before the court he took no stance relating to his involvement in and motivation for making the impugned material available through the vk account however he insisted that prosecution for a quotation from a work of art which wa not banned could not be compatible with article of the convention the domestic court established that the applicant had expressed interest in what could be described a nationalist idea the applicant did not challenge this finding at the national level or before the court the conduct held against the applicant consisted in his having made available to others video and audio file that had been uploaded onto his personal vk account there is no indication that those act were accompanied by any statement for instance uncovering the applicant attitude toward the impugned material relying on the expert report the appellate court considered that the applicant communicative intent consisted in calling to violence aiming at ethnic discord and at violating non russian right and freedom the appellate court also relied on the fact that the uploading of the video had been followed by the uploading of similar content in the form of an audio recording witness statement suggesting that the applicant had had some interest in nationalist idea and a wiretapped telephone conversation between the applicant and another person see paragraph above it ha not been argued and the court ha no reason to consider that by uploading the impugned material to his vk account and making it accessible to other user the applicant contributed or at least intended to contribute to any debate on a matter of public interest compare atamanchuk cited above the court note that the video showed a man dressed a an elderly woman expressing xenophobic and racist view and acting upon them being incited by another person acting a a supporter of socalled nationalist or neo nazi idea the only evident element concern the fact that the video had the title russia granny this title corresponded to the title of a cinematographic work entitled russia a acknowledged by both the expert in the criminal case and the applicant that film wa wellknown in russia see paragraph and above and the annex to this judgment below it is also uncontested that the film could be classified a a mockumentary the expert considered that the impugned oneminute excerpt wa a semantically complete scene filmed in this genre and represented within the film plot the process of filming a propaganda video the court reiterates that satire is a form of artistic expression and social commentary which by it inherent feature of exaggeration and distortion of reality naturally aim to provoke and agitate accordingly any interference with the right of an artist or anyone else to use this mean of expression should be examined with particular care see eon v france no march and case cited therein it ha not been claimed and the court ha no reason to consider that the applicant act of sharing the impugned video wa intended a a mean of his own artistic expression or satirical social commentary at the same time the court note that the film message wa no longer apparent in any manner or form the video being presented in isolation from the overall context of the film and without any context or commentary in the court view an ordinary viewer could be mistaken a to the message of the video that it wa to mock propaganda technique with a racist agenda rather than to put forward that racist agenda and to demonstrate a way to pursue it the court accepts the national court finding that the video could be reasonably perceived a stirring up ethnic discord by calling for violence against people of azerbaijani origin and a calling for violating their right by violent action a regard the audio it ha not been contested and the court accepts that it could be reasonably perceived a stirring up ethnic discord by calling for violence against people of non russian ethnicity and a calling for violating their right by violent action the manner and the immediate context in which the applicant disseminated that thirdparty content do not prompt the court to reach a different conclusion in the present case in view of the foregoing consideration and given the racist nature of the material and the absence of any commentary on such content the court doubt that the applicant exercise of his freedom to impart information and idea had any appreciable socially redeeming value in the specific circumstance of the case when finding the applicant guilty of the criminal offence of intentional call to ethnic discord by violent action and violation of the right of others by violent action the domestic court convincingly established the applicant criminal intent visàvis that content compare mbala mbala v france dec no echr extract and nikowitz and verlagsgruppe news gmb h v austria no february specifically the court considers that the domestic court convincingly demonstrated that the impugned material incited ethnic discord between russian people and people of non russian ethnic origin azerbaijani a for the video and foremost the applicant clear intention to bring about the commission of related act of hatred or intolerance the material wa uploaded to a socialnetworking website that wa accessible at the time through the internet the appellate court stated that a large audience could watch the video and listen to the audio it transpires from the witness statement made at the national level that access to that material depended on the account user acceptance of those witness a friend of the account thereby granting them access to it content see paragraph and above some fifty people could have accessed that material at the time of the event under examination the applicant doe not appear to have been a wellknown or popular user of social medium see magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no echr or a public or influential figure contrast osmani and others v the former yugoslav republic of macedonia dec no october and féret cited above which could have attracted public attention to the material and thus have enhanced it potential harmful impact having said this the court doe not exclude that the sharing of such content in such a manner within an online group even a relatively small one of likeminded person may have the effect of reinforcing and radicalising their idea without being exposed to any critical discussion or different view the court also note that there is no indication in the decision of the domestic court that the material wa published against a sensitive social or political background or that at the relevant time the general security situation in russia wa tense or that there were any clash disturbance or interethnic riot or that there existed an atmosphere of hostility and hatred towards the non russian ethnic group in particular those of the azerbaijani ethnic origin or any other particular circumstance in which that material wa liable to produce imminent unlawful action in respect of azerbaijani or other ethnic group and to expose them to a real threat of physical violence the domestic court did not refer to any factor or context which would show that the applicant action could have actually encouraged violence and thus put those group or any of it member at risk however the court considers that the abovementioned element are not decisive in the present case the court ha found that the domestic court reasoning based on the applicant criminal intent can be regarded a both relevant and sufficient in the present case to justify his prosecution for a criminal offence for a call for ethnic discord through violence lastly the court reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are factor to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no echr xi the court considers that the suspended eighteenmonth term of imprisonment with a similar period of probation and some other requirement see paragraph above wa proportionate in the specific circumstance of the case compare pastörs cited above stomakhin cited above and sinkova v ukraine no february there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention having reached this conclusion the court find it unnecessary to delve into whether article should be applied in the present case see in the same vein atamanchuk cited above alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that the appeal hearing in his criminal case had been held in camera article in the relevant part read a follows in the determination of any criminal charge against him everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interest of moral public order or national security in a democratic society where the interest of juvenile or the protection of the private life of the party so require or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstance where publicity would prejudice the interest of justice admissibility the government stated that the present application which included the complaint under article of the convention had to be dismissed with reference to article of the convention however they made no related argument a regard article in relation to the applicant right to a public hearing the applicant made no specific comment in that regard having regard to it caselaw see varela geis v spain no and march the court doe not find it appropriate to declare the complaint incompatible ratione materiae the court also note that this complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merit the applicant made no observation on the present complaint the government stated that the appellate court had provided reason for disallowing the public presence and that the cassationinstance court had confirmed that the decision to hold the appeal hearing in camera had been justified see paragraph and above the court note at the outset that the applicant did not allege that the appeal decision had not been pronounced publicly the complaint before the court is limited to holding the appeal hearing in camera that is to the exclusion of the press and public from it the court also note that the applicant ha not substantiated in which manner that decision adversely affected the equality of arm and adversarial procedure in the criminal case it is noted that the appeal court held an oral hearing at which the party were present and made submission the court reiterates that the public character of proceeding before the judicial body referred to in article protects litigant against the administration of justice in secret with no public scrutiny it is also one of the mean whereby confidence in the court superior and inferior can be maintained by rendering the administration of justice visible publicity contributes to the achievement of the aim of article namely a fair trial the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principle of any democratic society within the meaning of the convention see martinie v france gc no echr vi the exclusion of the press and public from all or part of the trial may be compatible with article in the light of the special feature of the case and in the interest of moral public order or national security in a democratic society where the interest of juvenile or the protection of the private life of the party so require or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstance where publicity would prejudice the interest of justice holding proceeding whether wholly or partly in camera must be strictly necessary in that last situation mentioned above and in any event must be strictly required by the circumstance of the case in respect of the other situation listed above ibid olujić v croatia no february welke and białek v poland no march and chaushev and others v russia no and others october it ha not been contested and the court doe not rule out that safety consideration relating to a threat to one physical integrity could fall within the scope of at least one of the legitimate interest mentioned above nor wa it in dispute that such type of measure a the exclusion of the press and public from a court hearing could be tailored to deal with that kind of consideration it appears that under russian law the exclusion of the press and public from a court hearing wa also considered a one of the protective measure in that context where there wa sufficient information confirming the existence of threat to inter alia the physical integrity of a crime victim a witness or another person participating in the criminal proceeding or their next of kin see paragraph above having said this the court is not satisfied that the decision to hold the appeal hearing in camera wa shown to have been strictly required on account of the mere fact that the type of offence for which the applicant stood trial wa prescribed in the chapter of the code of criminal procedure concerning offence against the foundation of the constitutional regime and national security nor wa this fact per se sufficient for deducing that the safety of unspecified person that participated or were going to participate in the appeal hearing wa at stake the factual and legal element of the specific charge against the applicant concerned dissemination of material that allegedly incited or could incite social racial or ethnic discord the procedural decision issued by the appeal court contained no further factual element or legal argument for justifying the hearing in camera in this connection the court also note that the justice of the peace held a public hearing without any safety consideration being raised the appeal court decision did not point out any circumstance namely relating to the physical safety of any witness or the like that justified the hearing in camera at the appellate stage of the proceeding the court also note that the cassationinstance court considered that the applicant procedural right had not been violated on account of the appeal hearing in camera indicating that the justice of the peace had held a public hearing at which the evidence submitted by the party had been examined the defence had not appealed against the decision to hold the appeal hearing in camera and in their cassation appeal did not submit convincing argument to the effect that the appeal hearing in camera had significantly impinged upon the defence right in so far a the presentation of evidence had been concerned see paragraph above the court reiterates however that while the overall fairness of the proceeding is the overarching principle under article of the convention see jussila v finland gc no echr xiv the nonviolation of the defendant right to a public hearing visàvis the exclusion of the public and the press doe not necessarily correlate with the existence of any actual damage to the defendant exercise of his other procedural right including those protected under paragraph of article thus even assuming the applicant wa otherwise afforded an adequate opportunity to put forward a defence in the appeal proceeding with due regard to his right to an oral hearing and the principle of equality of arm and adversarial procedure it remains the fact that it wa not shown that the decision to hold the appeal hearing in camera had been strictly required in the circumstance of the present case namely for ensuring the safety of any person participating in that hearing nor doe the court consider that the examination of the case by the justice of the peace at a public hearing could entail the conclusion that article of the convention wa complied with in the present case in so far a the applicant right to a public hearing on appeal wa concerned the government have not argued and the court doe not consider that it wa appropriate to dispense with an oral and thus public hearing on appeal because the applicant had already had one at first instance the court note in this connection that after an oral hearing the appeal court set aside the trial judgment and issued a new one convicting the applicant the court concludes that the exclusion of the press and public from the appeal hearing wa not justified lastly the court previously held that a complete reexamination of the criminal case by a higherinstance court in compliance with the requirement of article of the convention could have the effect of redressing the procedural shortcoming before the lower court see idalov v russia gc no may and did not rule out that a similar approach could apply to the right to a public hearing on account of the exclusion of the press and public from a court hearing see izmestyev v russia no august and case cited therein neither the cassationinstance court nor the government before the court argued that the alleged violation of the applicant right to a public hearing on appeal had been redressed in the cassationinstance proceeding before the regional court in any event while it appears that there wa an oral hearing before the regional court there is no indication that it wa a public one see paragraph above or that the regional court proceeded with the complete reexamination of the criminal case there ha therefore been a violation of article of the convention application of article of the

decision on the case of virginia v black can be found in the court judgment in the case of fáber v hungary no july the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that her initial arrest and subsequent detention had been in breach of article and of the convention the provision relied on read a follows in the relevant part everyone ha the right to liberty and security of person no one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following case and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by lawc the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provision of paragraph c of this article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial release may be conditioned by guarantee to appear for trial everyone who ha been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provision of this article shall have an enforceable right to compensation a admissibility the court note that these complaint are not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that they are not inadmissible on any other ground they must therefore be declared admissible b merit alleged violation of article of the conventiona the party submission the applicant argued that there had been neither any legal basis nor practical need for her arrest given the vague wording of article of the criminal code it wa far from obvious that her action amounted to desecration of a tomb accordingly her arrest could not be regarded a based on a reasonable suspicion that she had committed a crime the applicant next contended that she had never absconded a she had been nineteen year old she had been free not to live with her parent or grandparent she considered that there had been no genuine attempt by the investigation to contact her before declaring her wanted by the police thus according to her it had been open for the investigator to contact her a the author of the video in question via the indicated site in the alternative he could have asked the applicant relative or friend for her email address furthermore a she had been a university student she could have easily been reached through her university contact lastly the investigator could have summonsed her through her mother or grandmother however none of those action had been undertaken furthermore the applicant complained that her detention from may to june had not been covered by any judicial decision the government maintained that the applicant arrest had been in compliance with national legislation and accompanied by all the requisite safeguard they argued that the authority had had good reason to believe that she had been absconding given the fact that she had not been living at her registered address and her whereabouts had not been known the government further submitted that the arrest order with a view to bringing the applicant to court had been aimed at ensuring compliance with the equalityofarms principle and enabling her to respond to the investigator argument lastly a regard the particular period of the applicant pretrial detention from may to june the government observed that it had been based on the applicable legal provision and could not be regarded arbitraryb the court assessmenti general caselaw principle the court reiterates that in order to comply with article the detention in issue must first of all be lawful including the observance of a procedure prescribed by law in this respect the convention refers back essentially to national law and lay down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rule thereof it requires in addition however that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of article namely to protect individual from arbitrariness furthermore the detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is only justified where other le severe measure have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained that mean that it doe not suffice that the deprivation of liberty is in conformity with national law it must also be necessary in the circumstance see hadžimejlić and others v bosnia and herzegovina no and others november with further referencesii application of the above principle to the present caseα lawfulness of the applicant arrest in assessing the lawfulness of the applicant arrest the court attache weight firstly to the fact it wa based on a judicial order and secondly to the limited scope of that order which wa aimed at ensuring her presence at the hearing with a view to examination of the investigator application for her detention a regard the necessity of that measure in the circumstance the court note that one of the main reason for the applicant arrest wa the fact that she had been declared wanted by the police the court ha held in it caselaw that the mere fact of being on a wanted list doe not mean that the person ha gone into hiding the important factor in measuring the risk of absconding is the actual behaviour of the suspect and not his formal status a a person on a wanted list see yevgeniy gusev v russia no december the court is not convinced by the applicant argument that the decision to put her on a wanted list wa hasty and unnecessary and that the police had not made sufficient effort to contact her it is not in dispute that her actual whereabouts were unknown to the police her family member living at the address of her registered residence denied having that information when questioned on february it is unclear how the police could have been more efficient in their attempt to reach her by email or through her university contact even le convincing is the applicant suggestion that she could have been directly contacted a the author of the video on the internet given that her identity had first to be established through investigation see for example paragraph above the court also ha doubt a regard the applicant submission that she had not been aware of the criminal proceeding against her until her arrest on march a confirmed by the casefile material she wa in touch with her family member who had been questioned by the police on february in respect of her involvement in the incident under investigation accordingly having regard to all the circumstance of the present case the court doe not see any indication of unlawfulness or arbitrariness a regard the applicant arrest there ha therefore been no violation of article of the convention in this regardβ lawfulness of the applicant detention from may to june the court observes that the applicant detention which had been ordered by the judicial decision of april expired on may meanwhile on may the case had been referred to the firstinstance court for trial on june the pecherskyy court held it preparatory hearing at which it ordered the applicant further detention a a preventive measure it follows that her detention between may and june wa not covered by any judicial decision the court ha already found a violation of article of the convention in a number of case concerning the practice of holding defendant in custody solely on the basis of the fact that a bill of indictment ha been submitted to the trial court it ha held that the practice of keeping defendant in detention without a specific legal basis or clear rule governing their situation with the result that they may be deprived of their liberty for an unlimited period without judicial authorisation is incompatible with the principle of legal certainty and the protection from arbitrariness which are common thread throughout the convention and the rule of law see for example yeloyev v ukraine no november the court ha also concluded that this issue seemed to stem from a legislative lacuna in ukraine see kharchenko v ukraine no and february having regard to it wellestablished caselaw the court find that there ha been a violation of article of the convention in respect of the applicant detention from may to june alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that her continued pretrial detention had been unjustified the government contended that it had been based on relevant and sufficient reason they observed that once that preventive measure had no longer been required the applicant had been released under an undertaking not to abscond the court note that the applicant pretrial detention in the present case lasted from march to june that is to say for three month the court reiterates that the issue of whether a period of detention is reasonable can not be assessed in abstracto this must be assessed in each case according to it special feature the reason given in the domestic decision and the welldocumented matter referred to by the applicant in his application for release continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indication of a genuine requirement of public interest which notwithstanding the presumption of innocence outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty see among others labita v italy gc no echr iv turning to the present case the court observes that in extending the applicant detention and rejecting her application for release the domestic court mainly referred to the reasoning for her initial placement in detention without any updated detail furthermore no consideration seemed to be given to the numerous letter of personal guarantee in support of her release at no stage in the period under consideration did the domestic court consider applying any alternative preventive measure and by relying essentially on the seriousness of the charge and the hypothetical risk of the applicant absconding the authority maintained her detention on ground which can not be regarded a sufficient the court note that eventually on june the applicant wa released under an undertaking not to leave the town in the court opinion this or a le intrusive preventive measure could have been applied to her earlier at least the reason given by the domestic court in justifying her continued detention did not suggest any indication to the contrary the foregoing consideration are sufficient to enable the court to conclude that there ha been a violation of article of the convention alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that under the existing legislation she could not claim compensation in respect of the breach of her right under article and of the convention the government submitted that the ukrainian legislation provided for the possibility to claim compensation for unlawful detention subject to a judicial decision acknowledging such unlawfulness it wa not however applicable to the circumstance of the present case because the applicant detention had been lawful the court reiterates that article guarantee an enforceable right to compensation to those who have been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the other provision of article see stanev v bulgaria gc no january with further reference and lelyuk v ukraine no november in the present case the court ha found a violation of article and in conjunction with which the present complaint is to be examined it follows that article of the convention is applicable the court must therefore establish whether ukrainian law afforded or now affords the applicant an enforceable right to compensation for that violation in her case the court observes that the issue of compensation for unlawful detention is regulated in ukraine by the compensation act the right to compensation arises in particular where the unlawfulness of the detention ha been established by a judicial decision see paragraph above the court note that a long a the applicant detention is in formal compliance with the domestic legislation it is impossible for her to claim compensation in that regard at the national level furthermore there is no legally envisaged procedure in ukraine for bringing proceeding to seek compensation for the deprivation of liberty found to be in breach of one of the other paragraph by the strasbourg court see nechiporuk and yonkalo v ukraine no april this mean that one of the principle of article namely that the effective enjoyment of the right to compensation guaranteed by it must be ensured with a sufficient degree of certainty see stanev cited above doe not appear to have been met in the present case there ha therefore been a violation of article of the convention ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained of a violation of her right to freedom of expression although she relied on article and of the convention the court considers it appropriate to examine her complaint only under article which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court note that this complaint is neither manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention nor inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submissionsa the applicant the applicant submitted that she had protested against wasteful use of natural gas and had tried to attract public attention to that issue in her opinion the fund used for maintaining eternal flame throughout the country would better serve their purpose if used to improve the living standard of war veteran she emphasised that in no case she had meant to insult the memory of the dead or demonstrate a disrespectful attitude towards the tomb the applicant observed that she had neither damaged the memorial nor breached public order she also drew the court attention to the fact that she had not tried to conceal her action to the contrary she had immediately posted the video on the internet the applicant lawyer further stated her position a follows the applicant belief that any impartial individual who would watch the abovementioned video and who would familiarise himself with the statement of the st luke brotherhood would understand that the applicant performed an act that wa intended to protest against the wasteful upkeep of the eternal flame and wa not an expression of contempt to the gravesite the applicant next argued that there wa no conclusive evidence that the tomb of the unknown soldier wa located exactly beneath the eternal flame on which she had fried egg overall the applicant considered that she had wrongly been convicted of a criminal offence which she had not committed she argued that the interference with her right to freedom of expression could not be regarded a lawful given the lack of clarity in the definition of that offence in the criminal code a regard the definition of desecration of a tomb under the law on burial and funeral business the applicant contended that it did attribute weight to the existence of respective criminal intention such a to defile the family or public memory of the deceased or to manifest contempt towards the burial place the social and religious principle and tradition in this area see paragraph above however she maintained no such intention from her side had ever been established the applicant also submitted in broad term that the judicial decision taken in her case ran contrary to the established jurisprudence on the subject she cited in that regard several domestic judgment on tomb desecration case see paragraph above furthermore the applicant maintained that her criminal conviction had not pursued any legitimate aim according to her it sole purpose wa to punish her for the expression of her view the applicant also argued that the impugned interference had not been necessary in a democratic society given that the performance had already taken place and had not led to any negative consequence for anybodyb the government the government accepted that there had been an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression but argued that it had been in compliance with paragraph of article of the convention they contended that article of the criminal code under which the applicant had been convicted wa worded with sufficient precision a stated therein desecration of a tomb could consist of different action and the motif behind were not essential in the government opinion there were no reason to doubt that the applicant action amounted to desecration of the tomb of the unknown soldier they noted that the eternal flame on which the applicant had fried egg wa a part of the memorial comprising thirtytwo tomb of soldier who had lost their life during the second world war it wa a sacred and symbolic place where every year war veteran gathered to commemorate their fallen comrade accordingly the government maintained that regardless of her stated motif the applicant action had demonstrated disrespect and mockery and had been insulting for veteran and for those whose relative had perished during the war the government therefore argued that the applicant conviction had pursued a legitimate aim namely protection of moral and others right a to whether it wa necessary in a democratic society the government drew the court attention to the fact that the applicant prison sentence had been suspended accordingly the interference with her right under article could not be regarded a disproportionate to the aim pursued the court assessment it is not in dispute that there ha been an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression in the present case it remains to be seen whether that interference wa prescribed by law pursued a legitimate aim and wa necessary in a democratic societya prescribed by law according to the court caselaw the expression prescribed by law entail in particular a requirement of foreseeability a norm can not be regarded a a law unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the person concerned to regulate his or her conduct he or she needed to be able if need be with appropriate advice to foresee to a degree that wa reasonable in the circumstance the consequence that a given action could entail however the court ha held that these consequence do not need to be foreseeable with absolute certainty a experience showed that to be unattainable even in case in which the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression had taken the form of a criminal penalty the court ha recognised the impossibility of attaining absolute precision in the framing of law especially in field in which the situation change according to the prevailing view of society and ha accepted that the need to avoid rigidity and keep pace with changing circumstance mean that many law are couched in term which are to some extent vague and whose interpretation and application are question of practice see for example perinçek v switzerland gc no and echr extract with further reference in the present case the applicant wa criminally prosecuted for desecrating the tomb of the unknown soldier under article of the criminal code see paragraph above the court is not convinced by her argument that that legal provision wa worded so vaguely that she could not foresee it applicability to her case indeed it is neither possible nor reasonable to specify the behaviour that might be considered a amounting to desecration of a tomb in different circumstance the court therefore considers that the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression complied with the requirement of lawfulnessb legitimate aim the court also subscribes to the government view that the measure applied to the applicant pursued a legitimate aim of protecting moral and the right of othersc necessary in a democratic societyi general principle freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society see handyside v the united kingdom december series a no and for a more recent reference bédat v switzerland gc no march those who create perform distribute or exhibit work of art contribute to the exchange of idea and opinion which is essential for a democratic society hence the obligation on the state not to encroach unduly on their freedom of expression artist and those who promote their work are certainly not immune from the possibility of limitation a provided for in paragraph of article whoever exercise his or her freedom of expression undertakes in accordance with the express term of that paragraph duty and responsibility their scope will depend on his or her situation and the mean he or she us see for example vereinigung bildender künstler v austria no january the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered in the exercise of their discretion this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see bédat cited above lastly the fairness of the proceeding the procedural guarantee afforded and the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are factor to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see among many other authority bestry v poland no november and medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june ii application of the above principle to the present case turning to the fact of the present case the court note that the applicant carried out what she considered to be an artistic performance aimed at protesting against wasteful use of natural gas by the state while turning a blind eye to poor living standard of veteran see paragraph above more specifically she fried egg on the eternal glory memorial had her action filmed prepared a statement explaining her position and posted the video with that statement on the internet however the applicant wa criminally prosecuted and convicted only on account of frying egg over the eternal flame which the domestic court considered to have amounted to desecration of the tomb of the unknown soldier an offence under the ukrainian criminal code the charge against her concerned neither the subsequent distribution by her of the respective video nor the content of the rather sarcastic and provocative text accompanying that video see in particular paragraph above in other word the applicant wa not convicted for expressing the view that she did or even for expressing them in strong language her conviction wa a narrow one in respect of particular conduct in a particular place compare maguire v the united kingdom dec no march moreover it wa based on a general prohibition of contempt for the tomb of the unknown soldier forming part of ordinary criminal law a regard the fairness of the proceeding and the procedural guarantee afforded the court note that there is nothing in the case file which would suggest that the domestic court erred in their assessment of the relevant fact or incorrectly applied domestic law moreover while the domestic court paid little attention to the applicant stated motif given their irrelevance for the legal classification of her action the court note that they did take into account the applicant individual circumstance in deciding on her sentence a regard the applicant reference to domestic case concerning factually different incident of desecration see paragraph above the court doe not see how her conviction wa in contradiction with that caselaw the court can not agree with the applicant submission that her conduct at the memorial could not be reasonably interpreted a contemptuous towards those in whose honour that memorial had been erected according to her logic the only thing that mattered about the eternal flame wa the natural gas required to keep it burning however eternal flame are a longstanding tradition in many culture and religion most often aimed at commemorating a person or event of national significance or serving a a symbol of an enduring nature the one on which the applicant fried egg is part of a monument commemorating soldier who gave their life defending their and the applicant country during the second world war there were many suitable opportunity for the applicant to express her view or participate in genuine protest in respect of the state policy on the use of natural gas or responding to the need of war veteran without breaking the criminal law and without insulting the memory of soldier who perished and the feeling of veteran whose right she had ostensibly meant to defend in assessing the nature and severity of the penalty the court note it conclusion in the case concerning imprisonment for pouring paint over statue of atatürk that peaceful and nonviolent form of expression in principle should not be made subject to the threat of a custodial sentence see murat vural v turkey no october the court observes however that in contrast to that case where the applicant wa imprisoned for over thirteen year the applicant in the present case wa given a suspended sentence and did not serve a single day of it see paragraph above having regard to all the circumstance of the case the court considers that the restriction complained of is reconcilable with the applicant freedom of expression the court therefore concludes that there ha been no violation of article of the convention iii application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court find that there ha been a violation of the convention or the protocol thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party a damage the applicant claimed euro eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage the government contested that claim a unsubstantiated and exorbitant having regard to all the circumstance of the present case and the nature of the violation found the court considers it appropriate to award the applicant eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage b cost and expense the applicant did not submit any claim under this heading apart from her request for legal aid the court therefore make no award c default interest the court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the european central bank to which should be added three percentage point for these reason the court declares unanimously the application admissible hold unanimously that there ha been no violation of article of the convention in respect of the applicant arrest hold unanimously that there ha been a violation of article of the convention in respect of the applicant detention from may to june hold unanimously that there ha been a violation of article of the convention hold unanimously that there ha been a violation of article of the convention hold by four vote to three that there ha been no violation of article of the convention hold unanimouslya that the respondent state is to pay the applicant within three month from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with article of the convention eur four thousand euro plus any tax that may be chargeable in respect of nonpecuniary damage to be converted in the currency of the respondent state at the rate applicable at the date of settlementb that from the expiry of the abovementioned three month until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage point dismisses unanimously the remainder of the applicant claim for just satisfaction done in english and notified in writing on february pursuant to rule and of the rule of court marialena tsirli vincent a de gaetano registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the joint partly dissenting opinion of judge yudkivska motoc and paczolay is annexed to this judgment vdgmtjoint partly dissenting opinion of judge yudkivska motoc and paczolay we fully share the reasoning and conclusion in the judgment on all point related to article of the convention we respectfully dissent however from the majority finding that article of the convention wa not violated in the present case undoubtedly the applicant performance wa extremely provocative given the sensitive nature of war memorial however it is a firm stance of this court expressed more than forty year ago in handyside v the united kingdom december series a no that freedom of expression is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb the state or any sector of the population although we acknowledge that decision concerning attack on a longstanding tradition in many culture and religion aimed at commemorating a person or event of national significance paragraph are hard for all court the reason adduced by the national authority to justify the restriction imposed on the applicant were not in our view relevant and sufficient in particular we can not agree that the national judicial authority applied the principle embodied in article and that they based their decision on a satisfactory assessment of the relevant fact first of all we find that the analysis by the domestic court wa deficient for it failure to address the purpose of the applicant performance and it satirical nature the majority believe that since the applicant wa convicted only on account of frying egg over the eternal flame and not for the subsequent distribution of the respective video and accompanying text it can not be said that she wa convicted for expressing her view see paragraph of the judgment we can not share this view she wa convicted precisely for the performance a a whole two police officer who commented to her and her associate that their behaviour wa inappropriate did not pursue the matter until after the subsequent posting of the video online and the relevant complaint the applicant belonged to an artistic group called the st luke brotherhood which wa known for it provocative public performance paragraph their performance a she explained wa aimed at drawing public attention to the incompatibility of the official pathos when it came to remembrance of the second world war with the miserable situation of surviving war veteran together with other participant she sought to highlight what they perceived a the superfluous nature of an eternal flame which whilst honouring the sacrifice of those who fell in the service of their country did little to support war veteran who desperately needed the state limited resource satura quidem tota nostra est is the famous saying of quilitian describing the composite nature of this literary genre satire extended rapidly to all form of artistic expression mainly in the social and political arena a stanisław jerzy lec wittily mentioned in his unkempt thought there are time when satire ha to restore what pathos ha destroyed this satirical performance necessarily included filming the process of frying egg to be later put on the internet with the relevant commentary by filming and subsequently disseminating the video supplemented by the song and text the applicant and other participant chose to express their criticism through a rude and irreverent satire this court approach to freedom of artistic protest is clearly established in it caselaw in vereinigung bildender künstler v austria no january the court stated thatsatire is a form of artistic expression and social commentary and by it inherent feature of exaggeration and distortion of reality naturally aim to provoke and agitate accordingly any interference with an artist right or anyone el right to such expression should be examined with particular caresee also eon v france no march and alves da silva v portugal no october such careful examination ha not been afforded to the applicant whose claim before the domestic court that the criminal proceeding against her were contrary to article wa not adequately considered the majority dismissed the applicant protest stating in a surprisingly edificatory manner that there were many suitable opportunity for the applicant to express her view on the use of natural gas or responding to the need of war veteran at paragraph thus ignoring it intended message and purpose the applicant satire had done exactly what this art frequently doe it transferred the viewer attention from an object to it social context an artistic gesture might demonstrate the conditionality of established value boundary but it doe not reject them in the context of freedom of speech the u supreme court noted in the famous case of texas v johnson when holding that the desecration of the american flag wa protected speech under the first amendment that symbolism is a primitive but effective way of communicating idea in a fastmoving world it is not surprising that those who wish to highlight a particular cause or voice an opinion would have recourse to those symbolic act and demonstration which are likely to gather a greater degree of attention and trigger a wider debate than might have been achievable with more conventional and established form of protest the relationship between art and the conveyance of opinion is a complicated one and whilst art should not be reduced to an opinion art quite often relates to the expression of an opinion in the present case the soviet song with a repeated refrain the battle is going on again and again a a soundtrack to the video also underline the satirical nature of the protest and is selfexplanatory the protester were criticising in their view the hypocritical behaviour of authority who do not want to accept that the battle is already over and that it is time to propose real and not illusory care of those who handed the victory the applicant action and those of her associate undoubtedly generated significant controversy and offence among many of those who became aware of it due perhaps to it perceived bad taste but their aim wa the opposite in the word of george orwell the aim of the joke is not to degrade the human being but to remind him that he is already degraded the matter received extensive coverage in the medium and online yet it must be emphasised that it is not the applicant opinion which have shocked and angered others but rather the manner in which she chose to communicate them to our regret neither domestic court nor this court commented on the satirical nature of the performance moreover the domestic court paid little attention to the applicant stated motif given their irrelevance for the legal classification of her action although a little scope under article for restriction on freedom of expression in the area of political speech or debate required them to give consideration to the structure of the performance a a whole and to conduct a sufficiently careful balancing exercise on the basis of the criterion laid down in the court caselaw in murat vural v turkey cited in the judgment the court statedin deciding whether a certain act or conduct fall within the ambit of article of the convention an assessment must be made of the nature of the act or conduct in question in particular of it expressive character seen from an objective point of view a well a of the purpose or the intention of the person performing the act or carrying out the conduct in question this approach must surely be relevant not simply in determining the applicability of article but also in assessing whether there ha been a violation of that provision finally this court ha already mentioned that criminal penalty for conduct such a that of the applicant in the present case are likely to have a chilling effect on satirical form of expression relating to topical issue such form of expression can themselves play a very important role in open discussion of matter of public concern an indispensable feature of a democratic society see eon v france cited above a the court stated in murat vural peaceful and nonviolent form of expression should not be made subject to the threat of imposition of a custodial sentence in that case even the infliction of criminal damage specifically the pouring of paint onto a statue were not viewed a being of a gravity justifying a custodial sentence in dmitriyevskiy v russia no october the court considered that the conviction of a journalist for incitement to hatred or enmity and his twoyear suspended sentence and four month probation had violated article a both the applicant conviction and the severe sanction imposed were capable of producing a chilling effect on the exercise of journalistic freedom of expression we find some inconsistency in the court concern over the severe sanction of a suspended sentence in dmitriyevskiy and the position of the majority a to the same sanction in the present case where the applicant committed no criminal damage nor any breach of the peace in sum given the lack of adequate assessment by the national authority of the applicant performance from the standpoint of article of the convention and the complete disregard of it satirical nature in addition to the disproportionate sentence we believe that article wa violated in the present case a a general remark the present judgment inevitably give rise to the question of how far a contracting state may criminalise insult to memory and designate certain space and structure a offlimits for individual to exercise their right to protest and express their opinion in a manner consistent with article there is a real risk of eroding the right of individual to voice their opinion and protest through peaceful albeit controversial mean u citing west virginia state board of education v barnette u in johnson the petitioner had been convicted for desecration of a venerated object under texas state law tex penal code ann a under the law desecrate mean to deface damage or otherwise physically mistreat in a way that the actor know will seriously offend one or more person likely to observe or discover his action for a discussion on this topic see the concurring opinion of judge sajo in the case of murat vural v turkey and judge pinto de albuquerque in the case of faber v hungary,,,

during the election campaign during the hearing the applicant argued that the newsletter could not be considered a campaign material and that gg should not be allowed to use the procedure under article of the election code he stated that he had been critical of gg in earlier edition of his newsletter but that the court considered that the previous edition had not been relevant according to the official minute of the hearing the applicant stated that the newsletter had been based on available document together with his own conclusion on october the płock regional court gave a decision in which it allowed the claim on almost all the point the court ordered thata a requested by gg the applicant and the trade union refrain from disseminating the informationb edition and of the newsletter

approximately eur in cost the regional court did not examine the part of the claim which related to the charity in which ggs wife had been treasurer ruling that the charity itself should have lodged a complaint the court considered that both the applicant and gg had participated in the election campaign the two edition of the newsletter had been almost entirely dedicated to issue pertaining to the election and to mayor gg a a person whose activity had been analysed in detail and criticised therefore the two edition of the newsletter had to be considered a campaign material and the case had to be examined under the procedure provided for by the election code the court emphasised that this summary procedure wa intended to ensure fairness in the election and to limit any adverse consequence of the dissemination of false information during that period the press had a duty to disseminate information in a responsible manner and based on fact otherwise the author and the publisher could be held liable a provided for by law the court considered that the applicant newsletter were example of a negative campaign against gg consisting of gossip insinuation and allegation of a sensationalist and speculative nature that played on the emotion of reader for instance the applicant had intimidated reader with the allegedly negative impact of the wind farm on human health and had suggested that gg had devised an uncertain future for local inhabitant in connection with the charity finance the applicant had used expression such a the case reek a new scandal wa unfolding and the prosecutor should get involved in connection with the false information about the increase in tax the applicant stated that gg would reach into people pocket according to the court such statement were aimed at manipulating the emotion of reader and the information provided had lacked detail or reference to it source such statement violated the principle of good journalism and breached the personal right of the claimant they unjustly placed him in a bad light and tarnished his good name the court further noted that gg had produced conclusive evidence that the applicant statement of fact had been untrue he had quoted inaccurate figure concerning the municipal debt the size of ggs landholding and the percentage of the planned increase in tax the point made about the mayor being solely responsible for commissioning the wind farm and for setting the amount of the allowance of local councillor and mayor and the assertion that contrary to the law he had been involved in additional paid activity had all been untrue the court concluded a follows taking into account the number and gravity of the allegation the applicant and the trade union should cease disseminating such information apologise publicly and privately to gg and receive a financial punishment for the unjustified breach of the personal right of the claimant in respect of his good name honesty competency responsibility for the financial standing of the municipality and integrity on october the applicant represented by a lawyer lodged an appeal against the decision the applicant argued that the newsletter could not be

published prior to the date on which gg had officially become a candidate in the election moreover the newsletter could not be campaign material a they had not supported any candidate running for election on october the płock regional court allowed an application by gg to supplement the decision of october by adding a requirement that the correction of the false statement and the apology be published by october on october the łódź court of appeal dismissed the appeal in the first sentence of it written reason the court stated a follows it should above all be emphasised that in his appeal the applicant doe not question the assessment by the firstinstance court that the statement made in the publication in question were untrue the court examined the argument raised in the appeal and dismissed them taking the view that article of the election code covered all form of speech linked to election campaign for speech to be covered by this provision it did not have to originate from the campaign committee of a candidate it included all statement made during the campaign and in connection with the election the court emphasised that in election campaigning the use of all available medium wa a common and legal practice provided that the information wa true and that the value judgment were based on sufficient fact the newsletter in question although apparently not supporting any particular candidate had openly agitated against the incumbent mayor gg they were representative of a negative campaign aimed at discouraging the electorate from voting for a candidate the election campaign began in august so the date on which both newsletter had been published fell within the period of campaigning the date on which gg had formally been declared a candidate for the post of mayor of the municipality wa irrelevant lastly the court observed that the applicant engagement in the campaign had been in clear breach of the law since member of electoral commission of which he wa one were banned from active participation in the campaign on october the płock electoral commissioner warned the applicant that if he continued campaigning his membership of the electoral commission for the municipality of bulkowo would be revoked the local government election took place on november gg wa reelected a mayor of the municipality of bulkowo in the płock regional court agreed to the applicant paying the remaining pln of the sum awarded in favour of the charity in monthly instalment relevant legal framework and practicerelevant constitutional provision article of the constitution

immediately article member of electoral commission shall not campaign for specific candidate or list of candidate the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article and of the convention that his right to freedom of expression a provided for in article had been violated in the summary proceeding under the election code the court considers that the applicant complaint should be examined solely from the standpoint of article bearing in mind that since the court is master of the characterisation to be given in law to the fact of the case it is not bound by the characterisation given by an applicant or a government see radomilja and others v croatia gc no and march article read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from

crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the court note that this complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merit the party submission the applicant emphasised the privileged role that the press occupied in a democratic society particularly in the context of free election the applicant wa a journalist and enjoyed protection a a public watchdog gg on the other hand wa a politician who should have displayed a greater degree of tolerance towards criticism the applicant considered that the interference by the authority had not had a legitimate aim he submitted that the publication in question had not affected ggs reputation and had not influenced the outcome of the election moreover ultimately the applicant had not been removed a a member of the electoral commission which would have been the case had his action constituted election campaigning in the newsletter the applicant had not commented on the private life of gg he had concentrated on matter important for the municipality the article had dealt with financial matter and other crucial issue such a the construction of the wind farm they had been aimed at raising awareness among local inhabitant of the action of the local government moreover the applicant had scrutinised the measure undertaken by gg over his entire fouryear term of office not solely prior to the election it wa not clear why gg had waited until the period of the election campaign to raise complaint about the applicant conduct the applicant considered that the only explanation wa that gg had intended to take advantage of the special procedure provided for by article of the election code according to the applicant this procedure offered protection to politician against any insult or defamation and should be regarded a incompatible with article of the convention the applicant emphasised that he had obtained most of the information directly from the municipal office and from other publicly available document the applicant claimed that during the hearing at first instance he had been deprived of the opportunity to adduce evidence proving the veracity of his statement moreover owing to time constraint he had been unable to appoint a lawyer or to apply for legal assistance finally the applicant emphasised that the penalty imposed on him had been unduly harsh and not proportionate to the offence the government considered that the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression had been prescribed by law namely article of the election code it pursued a legitimate aim a it had been intended to protect the reputation and right of others in addition the government emphasised the particular context of safeguarding the proper process of election a it had been necessary to protect a candidate during an election campaign from the dissemination of untrue information the government emphasised that the domestic court had carried out an analysis of two conflicting interest in conformity with the principle enshrined in article of the convention the interference had therefore been proportionate and necessary to protect the candidate during the election campaign the government accepted that there wa little scope under article for restriction on political speech and on debate on question of public interest they acknowledged that the applicant had been involved in journalistic activity and that gg a a politician had been a public figure however journalist had duty and responsibility and had to comply with journalistic ethic the case in hand showed that the applicant had failed in those duty a the newsletter had contained statement of fact that had been untrue in the domestic proceeding the applicant had not presented any evidence proving the veracity of the statement in question nor had he contested the firstinstance court assessment that they were untrue the applicant had not demonstrated that he had collected the material for the article with due diligence consequently it could not be considered that he had acted in good faith the government emphasised that in the context of the forthcoming election the dissemination by the applicant of untrue information about a candidate had necessitated a firm and quick response by the authority that reaction had been justified and the sanction imposed had not been disproportionate in that connection the government submitted that the financial penalty that the court had imposed namely pln payable to a charity wa modest considering that it could legally have been a high a pln the court assessment it is common ground between the party that the decision given by the court in the case against the applicant and the sanction imposed constituted interference by a public authority with the applicant right to freedom of expression the interference wa undoubtedly prescribed by law namely article of the election code see paragraph and above the court further accepts that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or right of others in this case gg a a candidate in local election within the meaning of article of the convention it also served to protect the integrity of the electoral process and thus the right of the voter it remains to be established whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society in this regard the following general principle emerge from the court caselaw see for instance pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no and in limine echr xi with further referencesa the test of necessity in a democratic society requires the court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article of the conventionb the court task in exercising it supervisory function is not to take the place of the competent domestic court but rather to review under article the decision they have taken in accordance with their margin of appreciation this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully or in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole including the content of the comment held against the applicant and the context in which they made themc in particular the court must determine whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify the interference were relevant and sufficient and whether the measure taken wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority basing themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article d the court ha held that the requirement to prove to a reasonable standard that a factual statement wa substantially true doe not contravene article of the convention see rumyana ivanova v bulgaria no and february makarenko v russia no december and rukaj v greece dec no january and ha held that a lack of effort to make out that defence against applicant see mahmudov and agazade v azerbaijan no december however it ha also held that if an applicant is clearly involved in a public debate on an important issue he should not be required to fulfil a more demanding standard than that of due diligence in such circumstance the obligation to prove the factual statement may deprive the applicant of the protection afforded by article see kurski v poland no july braun v poland no november and makraduli v the former yugoslav republic of macedonia no and july in the present case the applicant wa sanctioned in summary proceeding under the election code for statement made in two edition of his newsletter published during the local election campaign in the domestic court found against him and in particular ordered him to pay a sum to a charity and to apologise to gg who wa a politician and a candidate for the post of mayor of the municipality of bulkowo see paragraph above the court reiterates that free election and freedom of expression particularly freedom of political debate together form the bedrock of any democratic system see mathieu mohin and clerfayt v belgium march series a no the two right are interrelated and operate to reinforce each other for this reason it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinion and information of all kind are permitted to circulate freely see bowman v the united kingdom february report i this principle applies equally to national and local election see kwiecień v poland no january at the same time the court recognises the importance of protecting the integrity of the electoral process from false information that affect voting result and the need to put in place the procedure to effectively protect the reputation of candidate mutatis mutandis brzeziński v poland no july it should further be observed that a a politician holding public office and a candidate in election gg had inevitably and knowingly laid himself open to public scrutiny see lingens v austria july series a no and oberschlick v austria no may series a no article of the convention doe not however guarantee wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matter of serious public concern and of political figure under the term of paragraph of that article the exercise of this freedom carry with it duty and responsibility which also apply to the press these duty and responsibility are liable to assume significance when a in the present case there is a question of attacking the reputation of named individual and undermining the right of others by reason of the duty and responsibility inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression the safeguard afforded by article to journalist in relation to reporting on issue of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethic of journalism see mutatis mutandis bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii having examined the statement in question the court agrees with the domestic court that they were to a large extent statement of fact the regional court considered that the claimant had proved having produced material evidence that each of the applicant statement wa untrue see paragraph above it is clear from the minute of the hearing at first instance that the applicant did not rely on any particular evidence in support of the veracity of his statement or request the court to admit new evidence see paragraph above he limited himself to stating that the information wa in the public domain or came from official source without naming them the applicant can not therefore claim that his statement of fact have been supported by the material he had gathered moreover in his appeal against the decision at first instance lodged by a lawyer of his choice the applicant did not contest the conclusion of the firstinstance court that his statement of fact had not been true see paragraph above consequently he did not submit any evidence at the appellate level relating to his source of information or otherwise pointing to the veracity of his statement this fact wa noted by the łódź court of appeal in the opening remark of it judgment of october see paragraph above the applicant failed to give any plausible explanation for his failure to supplement the evidence at the appellate level furthermore in the domestic proceeding the applicant failed to indicate the source of his information and why they had not been accurate likewise in the proceeding before the court the applicant failed to specify his source and to demonstrate that he had acted with due diligence the applicant also failed to demonstrate that the research done by him before the publication of the untrue statement of fact wa in good faith and complied with the ordinary journalistic obligation to verify a factual allegation see rumyana ivanova v bulgaria no february the domestic court balanced two conflicting interest namely the interest of all participant in election campaign in being able to use every mean possible to influence voter and the right of a candidate to be protected from untrue allegation the płock regional court emphasised the duty of the press to report in a diligent manner and on the basis of fact see paragraph above the appellate court noted that even value judgment had to be based on sufficient fact see paragraph above the court reiterates that where the balancing exercise ha been undertaken by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the court would require strong reason to substitute it own view for that of the domestic court see von hannover v germany no gc no and echr having regard to the foregoing the court is satisfied that the reason adduced by the national court for sanctioning the applicant were relevant and sufficient within the meaning of it caselaw in this connection the court observes that it is unable to subscribe to the applicant argument that the very use of summary proceeding provided for in article of the election code wa in violation of article of the convention the court note that the proceeding of this type are conducted within very short time frame and they are aimed at ensuring the proper conduct of the election campaign by preventing infringement of the candidate personal right which are capable of affecting the outcome of the election the court reiterates that the provision of such a summary remedy during period of election campaign be they at local or national level serf the legitimate goal of ensuring the fairness of the electoral process and a such should not be questioned from the convention standpoint see kwiecień cited above at the same time a desirable a the expeditious examination of electionrelated dispute may be it should not result in the undue curtailment of the procedural guarantee afforded to the party to such proceeding in particular the defendant in this regard the court note that the applicant wa informed of the case on the morning of october and that the hearing had been scheduled for the following day see paragraph above although that clearly constituted short notice it would still have been possible for the applicant to instruct a lawyer on that day there is nothing to indicate that the applicant made such an attempt the proceeding concerned the two most recent edition of the newsletter which had been edited exclusively by the applicant the applicant did not adduce any evidence before the trial court compare and contrast kwiecień cited above it is therefore not apparent that the case wa of any particular complexity such that it would have been difficult for the applicant to present it effectively before the court the applicant instructed a lawyer after the hearing on october and wa represented in the subsequent appellate proceeding the court is therefore not persuaded that the circumstance of the instant case amounted to a lack of procedural fairness and equality that could give rise to an issue under article of the convention compare and contrast steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are factor to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no echr xi in this connection the court note that the applicant wa found liable for defamation in summary proceeding instituted by the aggrieved party the applicant and the trade union were jointly ordered to publish an apology and to pay the equivalent of eur to a charity the applicant ha not submitted detail of his personal financial situation and the court is unable to ass whether such an award against him wa excessive and imposed a disproportionate burden on him moreover it is not clear what amount wa actually paid by the applicant given the fact that he wa found jointly liable with the trade union in the light of the preceding consideration and given the state margin of appreciation in applying the summary procedure under the election code the court is of the view that the interference complained of may be regarded a necessary in a democratic society and wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued within the meaning of paragraph of article of the convention there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimouslydeclares the application admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on october pursuant to rule and of the rule of court

24,represented by m t abazadze and then by m n jomarjidze lawyer practising in tbilisi the government were represented by their agent mr b dzamashvili of the ministry of justice the fact of the case a submitted by the party may be summarised a follows the first and second applicant are journalist who at the material time worked a respectively the managing director of the third applicant and the editorinchief of a weekly newspaper published by the latter in the third applicant office in batumi started receiving report from local people of arbitrary custom clearance practice being conducted by georgian border police officer at the checkpoint in sarpi on the state border between turkey and georgia the sarpi checkpoint the first and second applicant decided to respond to the call by conducting a journalistic investigation on august the first and second applicant crossed the state border in the direction of turkey and headed back after passing passport control they without anything to declare entered the restricted custom control zone of the sarpi checkpoint where newly arrived passenger were filling in custom declaration and duty were being levied on imported good the restricted zone wa enclosed by a fence which had multiple warning sign on it saying custom control zone the second applicant started interviewing people who were in the process of declaring imported good to custom officer while the first applicant took photograph of the scene they had already recorded interview with all the traveller present when a custom officer warned them that they were hindering the smooth running of the custom operation and that since they did not have anything to declare they had to vacate the restricted custom control zone the applicant refused referring to the freedom to exercise their profession a journalist a they saw fit they refused to leave the restricted zone even after the chief custom officer repeatedly told them to vacate the premise a a result the two applicant were fined georgian lari gel approximately euro eur each for disobeying the custom officer lawful order an administrative offence under article of the custom code of georgia the custom code they were then escorted out of the restricted zone neither their recording equipment nor recorded interview were confiscated in the week following the incident of august at the sarpi checkpoint the batumelebi newspaper featured a comprehensive article about the custom procedure presenting all the finding of the first and second applicant journalistic investigation including the interview recorded in the custom control zone on the above date on november the first and second applicant acting in their individual capacity filed a court action requesting annulment of the administrative sanction imposed on them on august they claimed that it had had no legal basis that their conduct in the custom control zone of the sarpi checkpoint had been in no way disruptive and that they had merely been exercising their profession a journalist they further argued that their journalistic freedom had been undermined a a result of being sanctioned for interviewing people in the custom control zone the interview had according to them been a necessary step in the process of preparing their journalistic investigation see paragraph above by a judgment of february the tbilisi city court dismissed the first and second applicant action a illfounded after hearing the party submission and examining witness statement and other evidence available in the case file the court found that their conduct on august in the custom control zone of the sarpi checkpoint had disrupted the custom procedure more specifically it wa established that the question put by the second applicant to the people declaring imported good had prompted the importer to start arguing with the custom officer over the accuracy of the amount of custom duty being levied it had been because of that disturbance that the custom officer had ordered the two applicant to vacate the restricted zone the city court emphasised that the order had been lawful since the applicant had entered the zone without prior authorisation in flagrant breach of article of the custom code and article and of order no of the minister of finance of december since the applicant had not obeyed the repeated order of the custom officer the imposition of the fine had been both lawful that is to say based on article of the same code and proportionate a regard the first and second applicant reference to their journalistic freedom the city court reiterated that they had been fined not for exercising their profession a journalist but for breach of the relevant custom rule namely unauthorised entry into the custom control zone and failure to comply with the custom officer lawful order the court stated that journalist could not be immune from the rule that applied to the general public if the applicant had wished in their capacity a journalist to monitor the unfolding of the custom procedure in the restricted zone of the sarpi checkpoint all they had had to do wa obtain prior authorisation to access the premise and act appropriately once inside without stirring up trouble it had also been open to the applicant to gather the desired information about the custom procedure by alternative and le intrusive mean for instance by interviewing people already at the exit of the checkpoint after they had declared the imported good and paid the relevant duty on march the first and second applicant filed an appeal against the judgment of february they contested the lower court establishment of the fact claiming that they had not caused any real disturbance in the custom control zone of the sarpi checkpoint and that all they had been doing had been interviewing and taking picture of the importer of good and the custom officer the two applicant also called into question the interpretation of the relevant provision of the custom code by the lower court arguing that the provision were not sufficiently foreseeable a regard their effect lastly they reiterated their complaint about the fine representing a disproportionate interference with journalistic freedom by a decision of june the tbilisi court of appeal after reexamining the case on both issue of fact and law fully upheld the lower court judgment of february the appellate court clarified that since the first and second applicant had entered the sarpi checkpoint from the turkish side a ordinary passenger they had been obliged to abide by the custom rule applicable to all in other word they had had no right to enter the restricted custom control zone without anything to declare and without permission from the custom office after being given lawful order to vacate the unlawfully accessed premise the first and second applicant had had to obey them being journalist did not absolve them from the obligation to respect the law the appellate court emphasised that the relevant provision of the custom code supplemented by article and of order no were sufficiently clear and precise in their wording and that the two applicant could thus easily have foreseen the consequence of their wrongful conduct especially in view of the fact that they had been duly warned by the custom officer before being fined the appellate court further reiterated that it had been open to the two applicant to conduct the interview with the newly arrived passenger not inside the custom control zone but already at the exit of the checkpoint alternatively if they had wished to record the custom clearance procedure they should have sought authorisation from the custom office in accordance with article of the custom code on december an appeal on point of law lodged by the first and second applicant calling into question the foreseeability of the legal provision that had served a the basis for the sanction wa rejected by the supreme court of georgia a inadmissible which brought the proceeding to an end relevant legal framework article of the custom code of georgia a in force at the material time provided a follows the circulation of good transport vehicle and people in the custom control zone shall only be allowed with official authorisation and under the supervision of the custom office article of the same code read a follows resisting a custom officer failure to comply with the officer lawful order or request shall be sanctioned by a fine of gel according to article and of order no of the minister of finance of december which wa in force at the material time area building and mean of transportation including aircraft ship and railway unit that contain declarable good obtained the status of restricted custom control zone by default the lawalleged violation of article of the convention all three applicant complained that the imposition of a fine for engaging in newsgathering activity had constituted a breach of article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the government argued that the application wa inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remedy since the three applicant had never attempted to sue the custom authority under the general rule of tort law contained in the civil code they also briefly stated without providing any additional argument that the application should be dismissed for lack of any significant disadvantage under article b of the convention in view of the applicant abovementioned failure to sue the custom office lastly the government submitted that the third applicant had not exhausted domestic remedy a it had never been a party to the proceeding at domestic level the applicant disagreed in so far a the third applicant is concerned the court observes that this legal entity wa not a party to the domestic proceeding unlike the first two applicant it can be inferred from the party submission that this applicant did intend to complain to the court on behalf of it employee the first and second applicant however a legal entity is not allowed to claim under article of the convention to be a victim of act or omission which have affected the right and freedom of associated individual who are themselves adult person with full legal capacity to act and can thus lodge complaint with the court in their own name compare identoba and others v georgia no may with further reference it follows that the third applicant can not validly claim on the fact of the present case to be either a direct or indirect victim within the meaning of article of the convention of an alleged breach of the first and second applicant right under article this part of the application is thus incompatible ratione persona with the provision of the convention within the meaning of article a and must be rejected in accordance with article a regard the government argument that it wa open to the first and second applicant company to sue the custom authority under the general rule of tort law the court reiterates that where there is a choice of remedy the exhaustion requirement must be applied to reflect the practical reality of the applicant position so a to ensure the effective protection of the right and freedom guaranteed by the convention an applicant who ha used a remedy which is apparently effective and sufficient can not be required also to have tried others that were also available but probably no more likely to be successful see amongst many authority adamski v poland dec no january given that the first and second applicant choice to seek annulment of their fine the administrative sanction that lay at the core of their complaint under article wa a relevant and appropriate course of action they can not be reproached for not having had recourse to the other remedy referred to by the government compare lawyer partner a v slovakia no and others echr and the government objection in this regard should therefore be rejected a to the government objection under article b of the convention the court observes that it is unsubstantiated thus besides a mere reference to the amount of fine against the applicant the government have not explained why they consider that the applicant have suffered no significant disadvantage compare for instance berladir and others v russia no july and giuran v romania no echr extract furthermore no submission have been made on two safeguard clause contained in the relevant provision noting the nature of the issue raised in the present case which also arguably concern an important matter of principle a well a the scope of the limitation the court doe not find it appropriate to dismiss the present application with reference to article b of the convention the court note that the first and second applicant complaint under article are neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other ground listed in article of the convention this part of the application must therefore be declared admissible merit the party submissionsa the applicant the first and second applicant stated that the interference with their journalistic freedom could not be said to have been prescribed by law a the wording of the relevant domestic provision namely article and of the custom code did not meet the foreseeability requirement in particular the two legal provision did not allow with a sufficient level of precision for a conclusion that their entry and stay in the custom control zone of the border checkpoint had been unlawful they also argued that there had been no discernible legitimate aim for the interference with their newsgathering activity the two applicant also submitted that their action had never caused any disturbance in the zone that they had been unobtrusively interviewing the passenger and that the custom officer had therefore had no valid reason to sanction them also the only way of obtaining reliable information about the custom clearance practice had been to observe the process in the custom zone in person the applicant asserted that they had not been obliged by law to obtain prior authorisation to engage in journalistic activity recording and interviewing people in the statecontrolled zone a regard the fine imposed on them the applicant stated that the amount had been high enough to have a chilling effect on investigative journalismb the government the government firstly submitted that there had been no interference given that the applicant had been able to interview the people of their choice in the custom control zone of the sarpi checkpoint and publish a comprehensive newspaper article based on those interview furthermore they had been fined not for their journalistic activity but for their failure to comply with the custom officer lawful order even assuming that there had been such an interference the government submitted that it had been prescribed by law and proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued prevention of disorder and protection of the right of others present in the custom control zone a regard the lawfulness aspect they referred to article and of the custom code and article and of order no see paragraph above stating that first and second applicant conduct in the clearly identifiable restricted custom zone had been in breach of custom legislation warranting an administrative sanction the government further submitted that the domestic court had given wellreasoned decision being journalist could not give the applicant immunity from the law and it had been open to the first and second applicant to conduct the relevant newsgathering activity in a le intrusive manner by either interviewing the people at the exit of the custom control zone or if the applicant had wished to observe the custom clearance procedure by requesting prior authorisation from the custom office to enter the otherwise restricted statecontrolled zone the third party submission the medium legal defence initiative submitted that border area could be a valuable source of newsworthy story that could inform the public and contribute to debate of general interest it listed example of journalist travelling to such area to report on story involving corruption the cable undercover investigation nigeria custom of corruption bribery and forgery december trafficking san antonio express news border journalist in reynosa mexico navigate danger to report on continued gunbattles in the street may military conflict bbc kashmir conflict tension on the india pakistan border october and immigration borderzine experienced border journalist share tip for tough immigration story october the third party then continued by submitting extensive legal argument a to why newsgathering by journalist ought to be treated a an activity meriting a high level of protection under article of the convention those argument were mostly based on an overview of the court caselaw relating to freedom of expression but also by reference to international legal material on the matter the court assessmenta whether there wa an interference the court considers that even if the administrative sanction wa not necessarily aimed at the applicant a journalist it still interfered with their right to freedom of expression because they were held responsible for act that formed part of an investigation for an article to be published compare pentikäinen v finland gc no echr salihu and others v sweden dec no may and erdtmann v germany dec no january b whether the interference wa prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim the court reiterates it settled caselaw according to which the expression prescribed by law not only requires that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law but also refers to the quality of the law in question which should be accessible to the person concerned and foreseeable a to it effect however it is primarily for the national authority notably the court to interpret and apply domestic law see pentikäinen cited above and in the present case the applicant argument that the domestic provision were not foreseeable a to their effect wa duly examined by the domestic court which all ruled that article and of the custom code and article and of order no clearly proscribed the type of act in question see paragraph and above that being so the applicant argument contesting the interpretation of the relevant domestic provision and their application to the circumstance of the case is beyond the court competence given that the domestic decision do not contain any arbitrary reasoning compare for instance satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june pentikäinen cited above and haldimann and others v switzerland no echr the court thus concludes that the impugned interference wa prescribed by law within the meaning of the second paragraph of article of the convention furthermore the court accepts that the interference complained of pursued the legitimate aim of preventing disorder in the statecontrolled custom zonec whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society the court considers that in order to answer this question it need to ass the circumstance of the case against the following two consideration inherent in it caselaw under article of the convention the value of the newsgathering activity and the concept of responsible journalismi relevant general principle the court reiterates that the gathering of information is an essential preparatory step in journalism and a protected part of press freedom a restriction on a journalist research and investigative activity always call for the closest scrutiny by the court on account of the great danger inherent in attempt to restrict preparatory journalistic step see dammann v switzerland no april indeed obstacle created in order to hinder access to information which is of public interest may discourage those working in the medium or related field from pursuing such matter a a result they may no longer be able to play their vital role a public watchdog and their ability to provide accurate and reliable information may be adversely affected see shapovalov v ukraine no july the concept of responsible journalism a a professional activity which enjoys the protection of article of the convention is not confined to the content of information which is collected andor disseminated by journalistic mean this concept also encompasses amongst other thing the lawfulness of the conduct of a journalist including his or her public interaction with the authority when exercising journalistic function the fact that a journalist ha breached the law in that connection is a most relevant albeit not decisive consideration when determining whether he or she ha acted responsibly the court reiterates in this connection that paragraph of article doe not guarantee wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to medium coverage of matter of serious public concern in particular and notwithstanding the vital role played by the medium in a democratic society journalist can not in principle be released from their duty to obey the ordinary criminal law on the basis that a journalist article affords them a castiron defence in other word a journalist can not claim exclusive immunity from criminal liability for the sole reason that unlike other individual exercising the right to freedom of expression the offence in question wa committed during the performance of his or her journalistic function see pentikäinen cited above and with further reference thereinii application of these principle to the circumstance of the case the court observes at the outset that the domestic court themselves conducted a fullyfledged balancing exercise in relation to the applicant right to freedom of expression duly acknowledging their status a journalist and giving solid reason for their decision see paragraph and above and contrast szurovecz v hungary no and october the adequacy of the domestic judicial review significantly increase the respondent state margin of appreciation in this case a the court would require strong reason to substitute it own view for that of the domestic court compare amongst many others palomo sánchez and others v spain gc no and others echr rungainis v latvia no june and mgn limited v the united kingdom no and january a regard the existence of such strong reason the court to start with ha little doubt that the newsgathering activity conducted by the first and second applicant at the sarpi checkpoint were capable of meaningfully contributing to public debate on a matter of public interest compare haldimann and others cited above namely the allegedly arbitrary custom clearance practice however it is le persuaded on the fact of the case that the applicant used their best endeavour to interact with the relevant public authority in good faith and in a responsible manner ibid more specifically if the applicant wished to hear about the practical experience of traveller and merchant who had recently had dealing with the local custom office then a indicated by the domestic court instead of trespassing onto the restricted statecontrolled zone they could have waited for and interviewed the passenger at the exit of the zone furthermore the applicant did not suggest and prove in the proceeding before the domestic court that had authorisation to access the statecontrolled zone been requested it would have been refused alternatively if they deemed it important to witness incognito without soliciting prior authorisation the custom clearance procedure they still remained under a legal obligation to vacate the restricted zone a soon a they received lawful order to do so from the officer in charge of the zone it is also important in this connection that at no point in the domestic proceeding did the applicant show that only firsthand and direct knowledge of the custom procedure based on their personal experience and presence in the restricted zone could have the value and reliability to the extent necessary for their journalistic activity contrast selmani and others v the former yugoslav republic of macedonia no february and szurovecz cited above assuming that the first and second applicant had no other option but to make in their capacity a journalist a choice between the general duty to abide by ordinary administrative law from which they were obviously not absolved and their professional duty and that they made this choice to the detriment of the duty of a lawabiding citizen then the very least that wa expected of them under the concept of responsible journalism wa to be aware of and accept the legal consequence of the unlawful conduct including the risk of being subject to legal sanction compare pentikäinen cited above the court reiterates that journalist can not in principle be released from their duty to obey the ordinary law solely on the basis that article affords them protection see the general principle cited in fine of paragraph above and also stoll v switzerland gc no echr v two other important factor tip the balance in favour of finding that the interference with the first and second applicant right under article of the convention wa necessary in a democratic society firstly it is significant that the domestic authority did not object to the applicant making full use of the interview recorded during their time in the custom control zone which allowed them to publish the article on their journalistic investigation see paragraph and above and compare zarubin and others v lithuania dec no november and mikkelsen and christensen v denmark dec no may secondly a regard the nature and severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant the court observes that the amount of their administrative fine can not be considered excessive see mikkelsen and christensen the decision cited above and brambilla and others v italy no june in the light of the foregoing consideration the court concludes that the domestic court examined the question at issue with care and in line with the court caselaw and that the reason given to justify their decision were adequate the court doe not therefore see any strong reason to substitute it own assessment for that of the domestic court see mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no echr extract and palomo sanchez cited above there ha thus been no violation of article of the convention in the present case for these reason the court unanimouslydeclares the complaint introduced by the first and second applicant admissible and the remainder of the application

defence of his doctoral thesis on the same date the same information wa published in the other evening newspaper iltalehti in the form of an interview given by ku on april the public prosecutor preferred charge against the applicant and h the newspaper editorinchief at the time in his indictment the prosecutor maintained that by writing and allowing publication of the above article the applicant and h had given false information about ku in a manner that had been conducive to causing him suffering and damage and to subjecting him to contempt and that they had also disparaged him in other way the prosecutor did not allege that the information imparted in the article had been false a such but contended inter alia that the combination of large heading with question mark the text of the article the photograph of ku and his personal profile had aimed to insinuate to the readership that ku might have had a motive to commission the killing ku for his part requested that the applicant and h be punished and claimed compensation for suffering and legal cost in the same proceeding he contended that the defendant had unlawfully connected him with murder in finland largest evening newspaper the use of his photograph taken at the public defence of his doctoral thesis had added to his suffering a he wa thus defamed a an academic which wa to be his future career according to ku the worst part of the criminal act had been the combination of the heading and his photograph and the image thus created in the mind of those people who had not read the article itself the defendant had sought to profit by their act in addition to the permanent stigma ku maintained that the offence had brought shame and distress to his family the applicant and h contested the charge and the civil claim their main argument were the following the article did not contain any false information nor could it have disparaged ku or caused him suffering the latter point wa highlighted by the fact that ku had himself given an interview concerning the same matter to another evening newspaper published on the same date the article concerned a criminal investigation of general interest and wa based on information given by the authority ku wa a public figure and his connection with po had been an issue of general interest and significance in itself by pressing charge the prosecutor had unnecessarily interfered with the defendant freedom of expression protected by the constitution and article of the convention when heard in person at the district court oral hearing h submitted inter alia that ku had contacted him after the article had been published he had been very hurt and upset h had then offered him the possibility of rectification according to the document ku had turned down that offer on august the helsinki district court käräjäoikeus tingsrätten issued it judgment it convicted the applicant and h of defamation pursuant to chapter article paragraph point of the penal code the applicant wa sentenced to dayfines amounting to a total of euro eur she wa also ordered to pay ku jointly and severally with h eur for suffering and eur in legal cost in it reason the court noted that it had to examine the conflicting interest of freedom of expression and the right to privacy referring to section and of the constitution and article of the convention it also made reference to the supreme court precedent no kko where that court found that the freedom of expression did not justify violation of a person honour or private life in assessing the article written by the applicant the court found a follows it is undisputed that in the summer of ku wa a public figure it is also undisputed that the article did not contain factual error thus each piece of information contained therein wa accurate the district court ha to ass whether the article included such insinuation that have been conducive to causing suffering or contempt or if it wa disparaging in other aspect the article covered the pretrial investigation of a homicide which had taken place a few day earlier a well a another largescale case concerning economic crime already pending before the prosecutor the same person had been the victim of the homicide and one of the suspect in the economic offence ku had known the victim of the homicide and wa also one of the suspect in the case concerning economic offence the defendant have pleaded inter alia that the newspaper had been obliged to report on crime the article had emphasised the connection between ku and the victim of the homicide in the district court view no such circumstance have emerged in these proceeding which would have linked the fact that ku had known the victim of the homicide to his public activity nor ha it been established that the fact that ku knew the victim had been of general interest or that this piece of news had had such significance to society that it had been important to publish it the district court concluded the most central topic of the article had been the connection with the victim of the homicide and ku suspicion of economic offence organised crime and a possible contract killing the use of the heading the victim of the vantaa homicide had connection with ku along with the background information on ku under a title who illustrated with his photograph had personified the whole article to ku although the heading of the article carried a question mark and the first paragraph in the text mentioned that the victim might italic added here have had connection with ku the text doe not provide an immediate answer to that question nor doe it state clearly that the victim and ku had known each other only from other circumstance the article had left the answer open a the text dealt with the connection between the victim of the homicide and ku and at the end a possible contract killing ku had also been connected with a contract killing connecting a person groundlessly with a contract killing violates his honour by combining information received and statement given by the head of the investigation and by mixing two different criminal investigation the article ha given an ambiguous picture of the connection between those case the heading and the information concentrating on kus personal profile had made ku the main common feature of the crime the district court find that in the article ku had been linked with a homicide in a manner that insinuated a connection between ku and the commission of the homicide and a contract killing such an insinuation violates kus honour and ha caused him suffering the district court wa composed of one professional judge and three lay judge one of the lay judge wa in favour of an acquittal in his dissenting opinion he stressed the fact that all the information presented in the article had been accurate in his view the mere fact that a party to the case his family or friend were shocked about the news coverage or that the reader of a newspaper were not fully able to comprehend the text could not constitute defamation the applicant and h appealed against the judgment to the helsinki court of appeal hovioikeus hovrätten relying mainly on their previous argument they also contested the lower court interpretation of the law on november the court of appeal upheld the district court judgment in it reasoning the appellate court reiterated that giving false information or making false insinuation about another person in a manner conducive to causing damage or suffering to that person or subjecting that person to contempt constituted defamation a set out in chapter article paragraph point of the penal code it referred to the relevant government bill for the amendment of that provision he vp in stating that it wa characteristic of that offence to concern false factual information or a false insinuation bearing a close resemblance to factual information in principle the veracity of an argument may be reviewed afterwards if an argument is accurate or if the insinuation concern a fact the act may nevertheless be punishable a defamation under point of the provision if the information is given or insinuation made with a view to disparaging another person deliberately the court then found that it is undisputed that the information in the article published in ilta sanomat on july concerning two different criminal matter wa accurate a such the common feature of those matter ha been the fact that ku and the victim of the homicide had been suspect in one of the criminal case mentioned in the article the heading of the article the text and the photograph of ku on the cover and on the article have however created a connection falsely implying that ku wa somehow involved in the homicide the heading of the article and it tone were such that the fact that ku wa not strictly speaking an accomplice to the homicide only became clear on reading through the article more closely it followed that chapter article paragraph point of the penal code wa to be applied in this case a indicated by the district court the court of appeal went on to ass in detail whether the defendant conduct could be regarded a intentional the court found that the applicant wa a professional journalist and that she must have considered it probable that her article contained a false insinuation and that this false insinuation wa capable of causing suffering reaching thus an affirmative conclusion the court found no reason to deviate from the outcome of the lower court

applicant complained about a violation of her right to freedom of expression a provided in article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the court note that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submissionsa the applicant the applicant stressed that the guideline for journalist could not be used a a basis for criminal liability or liability for damage a they had only been drafted for the purpose of selfregulation within the profession the applicant maintained that the government and ku had never alleged at any stage of the proceeding that the information presented by the applicant in the article in question might have been incorrect the clear wording of the penal code showed that the judgment of the court of appeal had been incorrect in this respect the applicant had not written that ku had had a connection to the killer instead she had written that a connection had existed to the victim of the homicide which had been true the conclusion could not therefore be that ku had a connection to the homicide a the court of appeal had incorrectly stated the applicant pointed out that the court of appeal had not referred to the court caselaw nor balanced the applicant right to freedom of expression against kus right to reputation no reason had been given a to why there had been a compelling social need to limit the applicant freedom of expression nor had any reason been given a to why such limitation had been considered proportionate visàvis the legitimate aim relied on the applicant claimed that the government seemed to expect that there needed to be a ground for publishing information while the court caselaw showed the opposite namely that there needed to be a special ground for not publishing certain information the present article could not insult kus honour solely on the ground that the same information had been published in another evening newspaper in kus own word on the same dateb the government the government agreed that the applicant conviction and the obligation to pay damage and cost had amounted to an interference with her right to freedom of expression a to the requirement that measure be prescribed by law the government pointed out that the impugned measure had had a basis in finnish law namely in chapter section of the penal code moreover the guideline for journalist journalistin ohjeet journalistreglerna also regulated the correctness of information the possibility of publishing a crime suspect name had gradually been clarified through the practice of the supreme court but the applicant had not sought legal advice on publishing kus name and photograph consequently in the government view the relevant domestic law had been precise enough for the applicant to be able to foresee to a degree that wa reasonable in the circumstance of the present case the consequence which her action would entail moreover the legitimate aim had been to protect kus reputation the government maintained that the interference had also been necessary in a democratic society the title and the text of the article in question had indirectly connected ku with a homicide and his name and photograph had been published nationwide in that context thus a large number of person had become aware of the article even though ku had offered an interview about the same matter to another evening newspaper published on the same date he had not consented to the publication of his name and photograph in the article in question both the district court and the court of appeal had found that the article had given an erroneous impression that ku wa linked to the homicide in question even taking into account that he wa a public figure there had been no justification for giving the impression that ku had been connected to the homicide a to the fine and the amount of compensation imposed the government argued that they had been significantly lower than in some other previous finnish article case bearing in mind the margin of appreciation the government argued that the interference in the present case had been necessary in a democratic society the court assessment whether there wa an interference the court agrees that the applicant conviction and the award of damage and cost constituted an interference with her right to freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the convention whether it wa prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim the court note that according to the government the impugned measure had a basis in finnish law namely in chapter section of the penal code moreover the interference complained of had a legitimate aim namely the protection of the reputation or right of others the applicant did not dispute this the court note that freedom of expression is subject to the exception set out in article of the convention the court accepts that the interference wa based on chapter section of the penal code a in force at the relevant time it wa thus prescribed by law see nikula v finland no echr ii selistö v finland no november karhuvaara and iltalehti v finland no echr x and eerikäinen and others v finland no february and it pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or right of others within the meaning of article whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society according to the court wellestablished caselaw freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article of the convention it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society this freedom is subject to the exception set out in article which must however be strictly construed the need for any restriction must be established convincingly see for example lingens v austria july series a no and nilsen and johnsen v norway gc no echr viii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with a european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article see janowski v poland gc no echr i the court task in exercising it supervision is not to take the place of national authority but rather to review under article in the light of the case a a whole the decision they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation see among many other authority fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction the court must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case a a whole including the content of the remark made by the applicant and the context in which she made them in particular it must determine whether the interference in issue wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it were relevant and sufficient see sunday time v the united kingdom no april series a no lingens v austria cited above barfod v denmark february series a no janowski v poland cited above and news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see jersild v denmark september series a no the court further emphasis the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society although the press must not overstep certain bound particularly a regard the reputation and right of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information it duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with it obligation and responsibility information and idea on all matter of public interest see jersild v denmark cited above de haes and gijsels v belgium february report of judgment and decision i and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii not only do the medium have the task of imparting such information and idea the public also ha a right to receive them see sunday time v the united kingdom no cited above the safeguard afforded by article to journalist in relation to reporting on issue of general interest is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethic of journalism see bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway cited above in addition the court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also cover possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no and bladet tromsø and stensaas loc cit the limit of permissible criticism are wider a regard a politician than a regard a private individual unlike the latter the former inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their word and deed by journalist and the public at large and they must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance see for example lingens v austria cited above incal v turkey june report of judgment and decision iv and castells v spain april series a no similar consideration apply also to person in the public eye see fayed v the united kingdom september series a no b steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii and contrast with von hannover v germany no echr vi and mgn limited v the united kingdom no january in certain circumstance even where a person is known to the general public he or she may rely on a legitimate expectation of protection of and respect for his or her private life see von hannover v germany no gc no and echr moreover the court ha recently set out the relevant principle to be applied when examining the necessity of an instance of interference with the right to freedom of expression in the interest of the protection of the reputation or right of others it noted that in such case the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authority struck a fair balance when protecting two value guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain case namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see axel springer ag v germany gc no february and mgn limited v the united kingdom cited above in von hannover v germany no gc cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above the court defined the contracting state margin of appreciation and it own role in balancing these two conflicting interest the court went on to identify a number of criterion a being relevant where the right of freedom of expression is being balanced against the right to respect for private life see von hannover v germany no gc cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above namelyi contribution to a debate of general interestii how wellknown is the person concerned and what is the subject of the reportiii prior conduct of the person concernediv method of obtaining the information and it veracitycircumstances in which the photograph were takenv content form and consequence of the publication andvi severity of the sanction imposed turning to the fact of the present case the court note that the applicant wa charged prosecuted and convicted of defamation in her capacity a a journalist and that she wa ordered to pay damage and cost to ku the court observes at the outset that the article of july stated that po who wa brutally killed in vantaa may have had connection with the businessman ku in po wa captured trying to smuggle bag containing money from estonia into finland and the police suspected that those bag and their content belonged to ku in that matter which wa pending before the prosecutor for the consideration of charge po wa suspected of an aggravated receiving offence and ku of aggravated debtor fraud a part of the homicide investigation wa to investigate kus connection with the victim of the homicide kus full name and photograph were included in the article in order to ass whether the necessity of the restriction of the exercise of the freedom of expression ha been established convincingly the court must examine whether the balancing exercise between the freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life ha been undertaken by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the court considers that the general subject matter which wa at the heart of the article in question namely the criminal investigation into a homicide wa clearly a matter of legitimate public interest having regard in particular to the serious nature of the crime from the point of view of the general public right to receive information about matter of public interest and thus from the standpoint of the press there were justified ground for reporting the matter to the public the court note that according to the domestic court it wa equally clear that ku at the time the article wa published had already been in the limelight there is no suggestion that detail of the article or the photograph of ku were obtained by subterfuge or other illicit mean compare von hannover v germany cited above on the contrary the article wa based on information given by the authority and kus photograph had been taken at a public event moreover the court observes that the fact set out in the article in issue were not in dispute even before the domestic court there is no evidence or indeed any allegation of factual error misrepresentation or bad faith on the part of the applicant see in this connection flinkkilä and others v finland no april however the court note that the impugned article wa entitled the victim of the vantaa homicide had connection with ku although it wa phrased a a question according to the domestic court the title created a connection between ku and the homicide implying that he wa involved in it in the text of the article this allegation wa alleviated by stating that the victim of the homicide might have had such connection the domestic court noted that for the reader however this information only appeared in the text of the article moreover it wa also of importance for the domestic court that in the title ku wa alleged to have connection with the victim of the crime even though it wa specifically stated in the text of the article that the homicide suspect had no connection with ku this information only appeared towards the end of the article the court note that the court of appeal found in it judgment that the applicant must have considered it probable that her article contained a false insinuation and that this false insinuation wa capable of causing suffering to ku the court would in this context refer to the principle of presumption of innocence under article of the convention and to emphasise that this principle may be relevant also in article context in situation in which nothing is clearly stated but only insinuated compare and contrast ruokanen and others v finland no april in sum the juxtaposition of two unrelated criminal investigation with headline which clearly suggested to the ordinary reader that there wa more to po murder than what wa actually being stated in the text of the article wa defamatory implying that ku wa somehow responsible for po murder it amounted to stating by innuendo a fact which wa highly damaging to the reputation of ku at no time did the applicant attempt to prove the truth of the insinuated fact nor did she plead that the insinuation wa a fair comment based on relevant fact the court further note that in it judgment the district court examined the conflicting interest of freedom of expression and the right to privacy referring to the constitution a well a to article of the convention the court also made reference to a supreme court precedent in which that court referring to the relevant caselaw of the court had found that freedom of expression did not justify violation of a person honour or private life by upholding the district court judgment the court of appeal also accepted this reasoning the court therefore considers that the domestic court in their analysis attached sufficient importance to the applicant right to freedom of expression and balanced it in an adequate way against kus right to reputation finally the court ha taken into account the severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant the applicant wa convicted under criminal law and wa ordered to pay dayfines amounting to eur she wa also ordered to pay ku jointly and severally with her codefendant eur for suffering and eur in legal cost no other sanction or financial consequence were imposed moreover the court note that according to the domestic law no entry of the conviction wa made on the applicant criminal record a the sanction imposed only concerned a fine the court find the sanction imposed reasonable compare and contrast flinkkilä and others v finland cited above and lahtonen v finland no january therefore in conclusion in the court opinion the reason relied on by the domestic court were relevant and sufficient to show that the interference complained of wa necessary in a democratic society having regard to all the foregoing factor including the margin of appreciation afforded to the state in this area the court considers that the domestic court struck a fair balance between the competing interest at stake there ha therefore been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the application admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on april pursuant to rule and of the rule of court fatoş aracıineta ziemele deputy registrar president,,,

that minister were known to be honest and competent moreover the book described a situation in which two different reality of present day finnish society met a wealthy party leader and prime minister on the one hand and a single mother with everyday money problem on the other hand the court found that the fact that the girlfriend wa writing about her life and her relationship with one of the highest authority in the country did not restrict but in fact widened her freedom of expression when weighing the freedom of expression against the protection of private life the court found that the need to resort to criminal liability decreased when the disclosed information became more widely known criminal liability wa the last resort in guiding human behaviour and it use had to be proportionate the court could therefore not hold that the publication of the applicant book wa a criminal act moreover a the first applicant had obtained an opinion from a lawyer before publishing the book he could not be regarded a having acted with intent and could not therefore be considered a a perpetrator by letter dated april the public prosecutor appealed to the helsinki appeal court

disclosed these detail of his private life in the medium the fact that he had disclosed some part of his private life the protection of which wa due to his status much narrower than a private person

information concerning detail of his private life even though the girlfriend had the right to write about her private life disclosure of intimate detail of another person private life always required his or her consent the aim of the applicant book had been to discus matter of private life and it had no relevance to the prime minister political function or his hierarchical position in the state

that some detail of his private life had been disclosed before did not mean that they could not fall within the scope of criminal liability under chapter section of the penal code the prime minister had not waived his right to protection of private life in these respect nor had he given his consent to their publication by consenting to the use of his photograph on the cover of the book the court considered contrary to the appeal court that the information about how and when the prime minister had met the girlfriend and how quickly their relationship had developed had had relevance to general public discussion a these issue had raised the question of whether in this respect he had been dishonest and lacked judgment also the information concerning the great difference in the standard of living between the girlfriend and the prime minister his lifestyle the data protection concern and the protection of the highest political authority in general had had relevance to general public discussion the court found also that disclosure of information about the prime minister child wa not conducive to causing him damage suffering and contempt a the girlfriend had only given her own interpretation of the childrens attitude however the only reference which according to the court had illegally disclosed information about the prime minister private life were the information and hint about the sex life and intimate event between the girlfriend and the prime minister the court enumerated in particular seven part of the book which contained information about the start of the sex life in the beginning of their relationship description of their brief and passionate intimate moment a well a giving massage to each other and account of their sexual intercourse the court found that

penalty equivalent to one mentioned in paragraph the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that their right to freedom of expression had been violated when the first applicant had been convicted of disclosing information about somebody el private life article of the convention read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the government argued that the applicant company could not be considered a victim within the meaning of article of the convention the district court had rejected the public prosecutor request that the court declare the criminal proceeds forfeit to the state this decision had been upheld by the appeal court and the supreme court moreover the applicant company had received compensation of euro for it legal expense the domestic court had never ordered the applicant company to withdraw the book from sale nor had any attempt been made to prevent it sale accordingly the applicant company had not been able to show that it had been a victim of the alleged violation therefore this part of the application should be declared incompatible ratione persona with the provision of the convention in any event the government argued that the applicant had not suffered significant disadvantage and that the complaint should therefore be declared inadmissible the applicant argued that the applicant company had suffered a significant loss of income since when the present case commenced at the national level it commercial activity had practically come to an end it could thus be considered a victim the court note that the forfeiture request directed against the applicant company wa rejected by the district court upheld by the higher instance no forfeiture thus ever took place in respect of the applicant company the applicant company also received reasonable compensation for it cost and expense before the domestic court moreover the applicant company wa never ordered by the domestic court to withdraw the book from the market but wa able to keep it on sale the possible financial loss suffered by the applicant company can not therefore be attributed to the state but appear to be caused by the action taken by the applicant company itself in these circumstance the court considers that the applicant company can not be considered a victim a it is not directly affected by the alleged violation of article of the convention the court therefore accepts the government preliminary objection and declares this complaint a far a the applicant company is concerned inadmissible pursuant to article a and of the convention for being incompatible ratione persona with the provision of the convention a concern the government second preliminary objection alleging insignificant disadvantage the court considers that this objection is closely related to the merit of the first applicant complaint it will therefore examine this preliminary objection together with the merit of the case the court therefore concludes that this complaint a far a the first applicant is concerned is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission the first applicant noted that there had clearly been an interference with his right to freedom of expression he contended that the domestic legal framework did not offer justification or basis for denying him his freedom of expression the legal framework should have also taken into account the court caselaw which took primacy over the domestic law a the balancing exercise had not been carried out in accordance with the court caselaw the interference had not been prescribed by law the first applicant maintained that a prime minister wa an even more public figure than normal politician and that all aspect of his or her life related to his or her function for example the fact that the former prime minister had not publicly admitted that he had been using internet dating service had raised question about his suitability for office and about the soundness of his judgment it had been generally recognised by the domestic court and the government that the impugned book had not criticised the former prime minister but wa rather a tender account of a relationship the veracity of the detail disclosed in the book had never been questioned nor had this information been obtained by inappropriate mean nothing suggested that the interference wa justified on the ground of the application of the margin of appreciation of the member state a to the balancing exercise the first applicant noted that the supreme court had concluded that the book taken a a whole did not shock or offend even though some part of it did those part only referred to rather normal human behaviour between couple the former prime minister had consented to the publishing of a photograph on the cover of the book this photograph already indicated tenderness and sexuality the behaviour which the supreme court had found offensive including reference to taking sauna bath related to normal behaviour in the finnish cultural context in addition no detail were ever given such conduct a part of two finnish person life together did not subject the former prime minister or anybody else to negative publicity or personal suffering a such conduct wa inherent in finnish culture moreover the first applicant also maintained that the sanction imposed were not necessary or legitimate in the term of the convention and that these sanction were criminal in nature the government agreed that the first applicant conviction the fine imposed on him and the obligation to pay compensation and legal expense to the former prime minister constituted an interference with his right to freedom of expression however the interference had a basis in finnish law in particular in chapter section of the penal code which fulfilled the criterion of precision clarity and foreseeability the first applicant had consulted a lawyer before publishing the book and he had thus been aware of the legal risk connected with the publishing the interference wa thus prescribed by law and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the private life and reputation of others a to the necessity the government noted that the present case did not concern political debate but concerned the ninemonth relationship of the then prime minister and his former girlfriend told from the latter point of view the first applicant had written substantial part of the book at least the epilogue a the expected public interest in the book had been based mainly on the publishing of private information about the former prime minister the publication rather constituted a memoirsstyle exposé than an autobiography although dating fell within the scope of private life it could in the context of a prime minister involve public interest of a kind that justified the right of the public at large to be informed about the dating that information could influence the opinion of the public at large of a prime minister and of his or her ability to perform his or her official duty the government noted that the supreme court had held in the present case that the information about how and where the relationship between the former prime minister and his former girlfriend had begun had not been insignificant from the public point of view the court had further noted that a politician family life dating and other activity a a private person could be the object of justified public interest this wa the case especially when knowledge about a politician private life had a relevant connection with question raised by him or her in societal activity behaviour that wa not directly connected with the politician performance in public office or duty or other societal activity could be relevant for assessing the person quality required for these activity the supreme court had pointed out that a prime minister enjoyed a narrower protection of his or her private life than a private individual the government maintained that although a politician had to tolerate more criticism judgment and public interest in him or her than a private individual a politician also enjoyed a sphere of privacy and wa entitled to demand that it be respected the government noted that although the public at large could be considered to have the right to receive information about a prime minister private life no particular ground warranted expanding this right to encompass information about his or her intimate life the supreme court had defined in the present case that sex life and detail of intimate event fell within the core area of private life not even a leading politician private life and especially it core area could be excluded from the protection of private life in this respect the protection of privacy had superseded the freedom of expression the supreme court had not considered the book when assessed a a whole to violate the privacy of the former prime minister on the contrary the court had noted that the former prime minister himself had disclosed many of the fact discussed in the book the supreme court held that only the reference to the sex life and intimate event between the former prime minister and his girlfriend had violated the privacy of the former the first applicant should have had his consent to describe them although the former prime minister consent to use his photograph on the cover of the book wa requested and received this consent and the fact that he had not tried to prevent the publication of the book had not meant that he had given tacit consent to publish the information presented in the book the government further noted that it had been public knowledge that the former prime minister had tried to protect his privacy and had been particular about what kind of information to disclose although he had in some context permitted for instance his child to be photographed and had described his home life and relationship he had not disclosed information about his sex life or any other intimate detail to the public thus this information had not previously appeared in the public sphere the fact that the content and the tone of the description of his private life had not been insulting wa without significance disclosing the information discussed above could not be considered to have contributed to a societally important or relevant debate but had instead served to satisfy the curiosity of a particular readership the book had sold several thousand copy and might still be available in some bookstore accordingly a large number of people nationally had become aware of the detail of his intimate life finally the government maintained that the dayfines imposed on the first applicant had been lower than the fine imposed in previous finnish case even though he wa a publishing professional the impugned measure taken had thus not been disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued the government further noted that imprisonment had not even been requested by the prosecutor or the former prime minister moreover the supreme court had in it judgment fully recognized that the present case had involved a conflict between the right to impart idea and information on one hand and the reputation and right of others on the other hand it had thus undertaken a balancing exercise in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw accordingly the supreme court had not failed to balance properly the various interest in the case and it had not transgressed it margin of appreciation the court assessmenta whether there wa an interference the court agrees that the first applicant conviction the fine imposed on him and the obligation to pay compensation a well a cost and expense to the former prime minister constituted an interference with his right to freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the conventionb whether it wa prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim the court note that according to the government the impugned measure had a basis in finnish law namely in chapter section of the penal code moreover the interference complained of had a legitimate aim namely the protection of the private life and reputation of others on the contrary the first applicant appears to argue that chapter section of the penal code fails to meet the standard of the court caselaw a concern the provision in question chapter section of the penal code the court ha already found in the eerikäinen case see eerikäinen and others v finland no february in which the earlier provision of the penal code wa at stake and in the reinboth case see reinboth and others v finland no january that it did not discern any ambiguity a to it content the spreading of information an insinuation or an image depicting the private life of another person which wa conducive to causing suffering qualified a an invasion of privacy furthermore the court note that the exception in the second sentence of the provision concerning person holding a public office or function or involved in professional life a political activity or in another comparable activity is equally clearly worded see flinkkilä and others v finland no april in respect of the earlier provision reinboth and others v finland cited above and saaristo and others v finland no october the court accepts therefore that the interference wa prescribed by law see nikula v finland no echr ii selistö v finland no november karhuvaara and iltalehti v finland no echr x and eerikäinen and others v finland cited above in addition it ha not been disputed that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or right of others within the meaning of article c whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society according to the court wellestablished caselaw freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article of the convention it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society this freedom is subject to the exception set out in article which must however be strictly construed the need for any restriction must be established convincingly see for example lingens v austria july series a no and nilsen and johnsen v norway gc no echr viii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with a european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article see janowski v poland gc no echr i the court task in exercising it supervision is not to take the place of national authority but rather to review under article in the light of the case a a whole the decision they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation see among many other authority fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction the court must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case a a whole including the content of the remark made by the applicant and the context in which she made them in particular it must determine whether the interference in issue wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it were relevant and sufficient see sunday time v the united kingdom no april series a no lingens v austria cited above barfod v denmark february series a no janowski v poland cited above and news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see jersild v denmark september series a no the court further emphasis the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society although the press must not overstep certain bound particularly a regard the reputation and right of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information it duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with it obligation and responsibility information and idea on all matter of public interest see jersild v denmark cited above de haes and gijsels v belgium february report of judgment and decision i and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii not only do the medium have the task of imparting such information and idea the public also ha a right to receive them see sunday time v the united kingdom no cited above the safeguard afforded by article to journalist in relation to reporting on issue of general interest is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethic of journalism see bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway cited above in addition the court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also cover possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no and bladet tromsø and stensaas loc cit the limit of permissible criticism are wider a regard a politician than a regard a private individual unlike the latter the former inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their word and deed by journalist and the public at large and they must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance see for example lingens v austria cited above incal v turkey june report iv and castells v spain april series a no similar consideration apply also to person in the public eye see fayed v the united kingdom september series a no b steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii and contrast with von hannover v germany no echr vi and mgn limited v the united kingdom no january in certain circumstance even where a person is known to the general public he or she may rely on a legitimate expectation of protection of and respect for his or her private life see von hannover v germany no gc no and echr moreover the court ha recently set out the relevant principle to be applied when examining the necessity of an instance of interference with the right to freedom of expression in the interest of the protection of the reputation or right of others it noted that in such case the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authority struck a fair balance when protecting two value guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain case namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see axel springer ag v germany gc no february and mgn limited v the united kingdom cited above in von hannover v germany no gc cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above the court defined the contracting state margin of appreciation and it own role in balancing these two conflicting interest the court went on to identify a number of criterion a being relevant where the right of freedom of expression is being balanced against the right to respect for private life see von hannover v germany no gc cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above namelyi contribution to a debate of general interestii how wellknown is the person concerned and what is the subject of the reportiii prior conduct of the person concernediv method of obtaining the information and it veracitycircumstances in which the photograph were takenv content form and consequence of the publication andvi severity of the sanction imposed turning to the fact of the present case the court note that the first applicant wa convicted for disseminating information violating personal privacy and sentenced to dayfines totalling euro moreover he wa ordered to pay compensation a well a cost and expense to the former prime minister the court observes at the outset that the impugned book described a period of nine month in the life of the girlfriend of the prime minister at the time when she a a single mother dated the prime minister who had divorced his wife the book described the dating couple life and made reference to their intimate interaction even if the emphasis in the book wa on describing the girlfriend private life the book also described a noted by the district court a situation in which two different reality of present day finnish society met a wealthy party leader and prime minister on the one hand and a single mother with everyday money problem on the other hand the court note that the fact set out in the book in issue were not in dispute even before the domestic court in fact the district court observed that it wa never even suggested that the fact disclosed were not true the court note that the fact in the book were presented in a compassionate manner and the style wa not provocative or exaggerated there is no evidence or indeed any allegation of factual misrepresentation or bad faith on the part of the girlfriend or the first applicant see in this connection flinkkilä and others v finland cited above moreover the court note that it wa equally clear that the former prime minister had been at the time when the book wa published a public figure he wa thus expected to tolerate a greater degree of public scrutiny which may have a negative impact on his honour and reputation than a completely private person see paragraph above there is no suggestion that detail of the book or the photograph of the former prime minister were obtained by subterfuge or other illicit mean compare von hannover v germany cited above on the contrary the former prime minister consent to the use of his photograph on the cover of the book had been requested and received in order to ass whether the necessity of the restriction of the exercise of the freedom of expression ha been established convincingly the court must examine the issue essentially from the standpoint of the relevance and sufficiency of the reason given by the domestic court for convicting the first applicant and imposing a fine the court must determine whether his conviction and the criminal sanction imposed on him struck a fair balance between the public and the former prime minister interest and whether the standard applied were in conformity with the principle embodied in article see von hannover v germany no gc cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above the court considers that even though the emphasis in the book wa on the girlfriend private life it nevertheless contained element of public interest the supreme court considered contrary to the appeal court that the information about how and when the former prime minister had met the girlfriend and how quickly their relationship had developed had relevance to general public discussion a these issue raised the question of whether in this respect he had been dishonest and lacked judgment the supreme court also found that the information concerning the great difference in the standard of living between the girlfriend and the former prime minister his lifestyle the data protection concern and the protection of the highest political authority in general had relevance to general public discussion the court agrees with this from the point of view of the general public right to receive information about matter of public interest there were thus justified ground for publishing the book the court note that the domestic court also took into account that a majority of the information concerning the former prime minister private life which wa disclosed in the book had already been widely disclosed the former prime minister had disclosed information about his family and habit a well a about his relationship with the girlfriend and he had even published an autobiography in the supreme court also found that information about the former prime minister sex life and intimate event and his childrens feeling and behaviour had not been disclosed to the public before however the supreme court found only the reference to the sex life and intimate event between the girlfriend and the former prime minister illegal moreover the court observes that in their analysis the domestic court attached importance both to the girlfriend and the first applicant right to freedom of expression a well a to the former prime minister right to respect for his private life the domestic court examined the case in conformity with principle embodied in article and the criterion laid down in the court recent caselaw all domestic court and especially the supreme court balanced in their reasoning the first applicant right to freedom of expression against the former prime minister right to reputation by considering them from the point of view of pressing social need and proportionality the supreme court also narrowed down the scope of the problematic passage in the book it enumerated only certain part of the book which it considered to contain information falling within the core area of the private life of the former prime minister see paragraph above the supreme court found that such information and hint and their unauthorised publication wa conducive of causing the former prime minister suffering and contempt according to the supreme court it wa thus necessary to restrict the applicant freedom of expression in this respect in order to protect the former prime minister private life the court find this reasoning acceptable the restriction of the exercise of the applicant freedom of expression were established convincingly by the supreme court taking into account the court caselaw the court recall it recent caselaw according to which the court would require in such circumstance strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see von hannover v germany no gc cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc cited above finally the court ha taken into account the severity of the sanction imposed on the first applicant the first applicant wa convicted under criminal law and wa ordered to pay dayfines amounting to euro moreover he wa ordered to pay euro plus interest for nonpecuniary damage and euro plus interest a cost and expense to the former prime minister moreover the court note that according to the domestic law no entry of the conviction wa made on the first applicant criminal record a the sanction imposed only concerned a fine see paragraph above the court find the sanction imposed reasonable compare and contrast flinkkilä and others v finland cited above and lahtonen v finland no january except the obligation to pay the cost and expense of the former prime minister however this ground alone is not sufficient for the court to reach another conclusion in conclusion in the court opinion the reason relied on by the domestic court were both relevant and sufficient to show that the interference complained of wa necessary in a democratic society having regard to all the foregoing factor and taking into account the margin of appreciation afforded to the state in this area the court considers that the domestic court struck a fair balance between the competing interest at stake there ha therefore been no violation of article of the convention for the above reason the court considers that there is no longer any need to take a stand on the government preliminary objection based on insignificant disadvantage ii remainder of the application the applicant also complained under article of the convention that they had not been allowed to question a witness during the appeal court proceeding a that court had not held an oral hearing moreover the charge had been unspecified a no passage of the book had been identified in the light of all the material in it possession and in so far a the matter complained of are within it competence the court find that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the right and freedom set out in the convention or it protocol accordingly this part of the application must be rejected a manifestly illfounded and declared inadmissible pursuant to article a and of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the first applicant complaint concerning article of the convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on january pursuant to rule and of the rule of court françoise elens passos ineta ziemele registrar president,,,

article she had refused to answer the applicant company question regarding her membership of the nd see paragraph above furthermore the text of her reply wa dated october whereas the latest version

purpose of the rectification on january the court of appeal again ordered the applicant company to publish k reply the court ordered that the reply be printed on page of the newspaper and rejected k demand for a frontpage announcement of the rectification it considered that although the article had not explicitly alleged that k had concealed sed party asset such a conclusion would be reached by the average reader the article had linked k name with the disappearance of sed party asset after the statement contained in the article that there wa no evidence for any criminal activity had not offset the implication that k had been involved in the disappearance of the asset since it had been presented alongside the information that k had maintained and continued to maintain tie to company that had been funded with party asset regarding the length and content of the rectification the court of appeal noted that the wording of the rectification had been limited to what wa necessary to

the opportunity to give her view on the origin of those company capital stammkapital furthermore k had been under no obligation to answer the applicant company question the refusal to do so had therefore not called into question her legitimate interest in having the reply published lastly the date under the text could not be considered to be manifestly incorrect the first request for a

may have been incurred for the effective protection of honour and reputation every publisher and every newspaper motion picture radio and television company shall have a person responsible who is not protected by immunity or special privilege the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant company complained that being ordered to publish the rectification had violated it freedom of expression under article of the convention which in so far a relevant read everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or right of others or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the court note that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible merit the party submissionsa the applicant company the applicant company maintained that the article had in fact not associated k with the disappearance of sed party asset and had contained no hidden allegation in this regard rather it had clearly stated that there wa no evidence for k involvement in any criminal activity the assessment that the name k stand for a particularly unsavoury chapter in the party history the handling of billion in sed asset after the peaceful revolution in the gdr did not contain a factual allegation but rather a value judgment to the effect that k wa a financial beneficiary of the sed dictatorship a rectification should thus have been excluded furthermore the applicant company argued that k conduct prior to the publication of the impugned article had not been properly taken into account it would have been a simple task for k to answer the applicant company question regarding the duration of her time a chair of the association of friend of the nd since this information did not incriminate her in any way but wa not publicly available however since she had chosen to withhold this information from the applicant company see paragraph above she could not have legitimately requested a rectification in this regard lastly the sanction imposed on the applicant company by the court order had to be considered to have been even more severe than the order to publish the rectification itself since the applicant company had been ordered to publish the rectification with an incorrect date the courtordered rectification had still carried the date of k original request to the applicant company october despite the fact that the text had undergone several modification and the final version had only been submitted to the applicant company on december this discrepancy had endangered the applicant company reputation since it reader had been led to conclude that the applicant company had deliberately delayed the publication of the rectificationb the government with regard to the content of the article the government agreed with the domestic court view that the impugned article contained the covert assertion that k had been involved in the disappearance of sed party asset the reservation in the article that no evidence of criminal activity existed had merely pointed to a lack of proof but had done nothing to offset the allegation furthermore the government submitted that k refusal to answer a journalist question could not have cast doubt on the legitimacy of k interest in subsequently lodging a request for a rectification a different interpretation of the law would essentially result in the press having a right to information that it could level against any private individual the government lastly asserted that such a discrepancy between the date of the rectification and it publication see paragraph above wa not unusual and would not have caught the average reader attention the thirdparty interveners submission k emphasised that together with the rectification the applicant company had published an editor note confirming the veracity of k reply see paragraph above in her view this meant that the applicant company decision to lodge an application with the court had been contradictory and that it had not had any need for legal protection furthermore given that the inaccuracy of the information contained in the article had not been contested by either party the order to publish a rectification could not be considered to have constituted a very serious infringement of the applicant company right the court assessment neither party dispute that the domestic court order to publish a rectification constituted an interference by the state with the applicant company right to freedom of expression the court further note that the interference wa prescribed by law namely by section of the berlin press act see paragraph above it served the purpose of protecting the reputation of k and therefore pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or right of others within the meaning of article of the convention it remains to be established whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic societya general principle an interference will be considered necessary in a democratic society for a legitimate aim if it answer a pressing social need and in particular if it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and if the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient see for example bagirov v azerbaijan no and june and mp v finland no december the press play an essential role in a democratic society in determining whether in the present case the interference with the applicant company right wa necessary in a democratic society the court thus observes at the outset that a a general principle newspaper and other privatelyowned medium must be free to exercise editorial discretion in deciding whether to publish article comment and letter submitted by private individual the court ha held that the legal obligation to publish a rectification may be considered a normal element of the legal framework governing the exercised of the freedom of expression by the medium see kaperzyński v poland no april rusu v romania no march marunić v croatia no and march at the same time it ha stressed that given the high level of protection enjoyed by the press there need to be exceptional circumstance in which a newspaper may legitimately be required to publish for example a retraction an apology or a judgment in a defamation case see melnychuk v ukraine dec no echr ix and eker v turkey no october in this respect the potential chilling effect of the penalty imposed on the press in the performance of it task a a purveyor of information and public watchdog in the future must also be taken into consideration see mutatis mutandis radio twist a v slovakia no echr xv in respect of interference with the right to impart information the convention organ have held that the aim of the right to reply is to afford everyone the possibility of protecting him or herself against certain statement or opinion disseminated by the mass medium that are likely to be injurious to his or her private life honour or dignity see ediciones tiempo v spain no commission decision of july decision and report p in this regard the court reiterates that the primary objective of the right of reply is to allow individual to challenge false information published about them in the press see gülen v turkey dec no september see also the recommendation of the committee of minister of the council of europe quoted in paragraph above a to the relevant criterion the court will take into consideration whether there exists a sufficient connection between the statement in question and the requested rectification and whether the latter can be considered to constitute a proportionate reaction see the above cited case of eker and melnychuk one relevant aspect for this assessment is the content of the reply in comparison with the impugned statement see eker cited above furthermore the court ha taken into account whether publication of the reply would constitute a punishable offence ibid in the circumstance of the present case the court will also have regard to whether the length of the reply exceeds what is necessary to correct the information containing the fact claimed to be inaccurate and the timeframe within which the request for a rectification wa made see also the appendix to the resolution of the committee of minister of the council of europe paragraph above while it is for the national authority to make the initial assessment in all these respect the final evaluation of whether the interference is necessary remains subject to review by the court for conformity with the requirement of the convention a margin of appreciation must be left to the relevant national authority in this assessment the breadth of this margin varies and depends on a number of factor including the nature of the convention right in issue it importance for the individual the nature of the interference and the object pursued by the interference there will usually be a wide margin of appreciation if the state is required to strike a balance between competing private and public interest or different convention right see klaus müller v germany no november with further reference in case like the present one which require the right to respect for private life to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression the court considers that the outcome of the application should not in theory vary according to whether it ha been lodged with the court under article of the convention by the person who wa the subject of the news report or under article by the publisher indeed a a matter of principle these right deserve equal respect accordingly the margin of appreciation should in theory be the same in both case see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no june where the balancing exercise ha been undertaken by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the court would require strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court ibid b application of these principle to the present case in examining the necessity of the interference in the light of the abovementioned principle and consideration regard need to be given to the object content length and timing of the rectification for this purpose the following aspect inter alia should be taken into account see also paragraph above the existence of a legitimate interest in a rectification owing to the content and dissemination of the impugned statement whether a sufficient connection exists between the rectification and the impugned statement and the proportionality of the rectification in respect of it content and length the placing of the rectification and any delay between the publication of the article and the lodging of the request for a rectification regarding the question of a legitimate interest the court firstly note the different interpretation of the article reached by the national court in the regional court opinion the article had not connected k to the disappearance of sed party asset in such a manner a to require a rectification see paragraph above in the same vein the applicant company argued that the original text had contained no such allegation either direct or indirect rather the statement linking k to the disappearance of sed party asset had constituted a mere value judgement see paragraph above the court of appeal however considered that the average reader would understand the article a implying that k had been involved in the disappearance of sed party asset and that the article thus made a statement of fact see paragraph above in this regard the court note that under the relevant domestic law see paragraph above a rectification may only be requested in respect of factual allegation the court reiterates that it task in exercising it supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authority but rather to review under article of the convention the decision they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation see bédat v switzerland gc no iii march the court ha recognised that the limit of acceptable criticism are wider with regard to a politician acting in his public capacity than in relation to a private individual see lingens v austria july series a no and oberschlick v austria no may series a no however this requirement of tolerance doe not involve a duty to tolerate factual inaccuracy the court observes that in assessing the content of the article the court of appeal took account notably of the divergent statement in the article to the effect that k name wa linked to the disappearance of sed party asset but that no evidence linked her to any criminal activity in the court view the court of appeal gave a lengthy and wellreasoned assessment of the article content and it interpretation showed no sign of arbitrariness accordingly it finding that k had a legitimate interest in the requested rectification doe not raise concern moreover in the light of the appellate court interpretation the court note that the requested rectification had a sufficient connection to the impugned article with regard to the applicant company argument that the domestic court should have refused k request for a rectification on the basis of her refusal to answer it question see paragraph above the court reiterates that a person conduct prior to publication will only reduce his or her legitimate expectation regarding the effective protection of his or her private life under specific circumstance see axel springer ag v germany gc no february with further reference usually such a consequence will require the person concerned to have sought the limelight himself ibidem or result from the person own illicit action such a for example the commission of a criminal offence see mikolajová v slovakia no january the court observes moreover that while press organ are held to report in good faith in order to provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the ethic of journalism see axel springer ag cited above and thus should give the person concerned the chance to defend him or herself the fact that the impugned allegation were communicated doe not confer unrestricted freedom to publish unverified allegation neither doe it preclude the right of reply of the person concerned in order to correct fact claimed to be inaccurate therefore and taking into account that the applicant company argument doe not concern any illicit behaviour on the part of k prior to the publication of the contested article her refusal to answer the applicant company question can not serve a an argument for limiting her right to a rectification of incorrect fact the court further observes that the statement in question were published in a daily newspaper see paragraph above there is no indication that there wa an undue delay between the publication of the impugned article and the lodging of a request for a rectification see paragraph and above with regard to the proportionality of the rectification order the court note at the outset that there is a material difference between the rectification of fact claimed to be inaccurate and sanction such a the prohibition on publication criminal sanction and the order to pay damage for value judgement in defamation case see mutatis mutandis lingens cited above and oberschlick cited above in determining the proportionality of the rectification order the court of appeal considered that the applicant company presented k connection to company with alleged tie to the sed in some detail accordingly it found that the information provided in k reply in this regard had not exceeded what wa necessary to counter the applicant company allegation the court see no reason to challenge this assessment it observes in addition that the rectification wa to be printed on the same page a that on which the original article had appeared and that a request to have the rectification announced on the newspaper frontpage had been refused see paragraph above furthermore there is no indication that the length of k reply exceeded the length of the statement in question see for a similar factual situation and a fortiori funke woman group gmb h v germany dec committee no and december similarly nothing suggests that the publication of the reply constituted a punishable offence lastly the court note that k reply did not bear the date of the final version the applicant company had been ordered to publish but instead the date of k original request to the applicant company see paragraph above in this regard the court of appeal considered that the discrepancy did not render the published information manifestly incorrect while the text of the original reply had been modified several time in order to alleviate the domestic court legal concern the core message of the reply wa identical see paragraph above the court see no reason to disagree with this assessment in the light of the aforementioned consideration the court find that in assessing the circumstance submitted for it appreciation the court of appeal gave due consideration to the principle and criterion a laid down by the court caselaw for balancing the right to respect for private life and the right to freedom of expression the court discerns no strong reason that would require it to substitute it view for that of the court of appeal see the caselaw quoted in paragraph above accordingly there ha been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the application admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on january pursuant to rule and of the rule of court ilse freiwirth gabriele kucsko stadlmayer deputy registrar

fund which he had provided to nra had proved to be incorrect he made the following statement the information wa wrong unfounded a part of my duty i wa carrying out my task of managing the bank

newlyestablished political party of which al wa one of the leader he had stood for election his candidacy had been widely advertised and it had been accordingly examined by the press and other mass medium nra had published a series of article about the money spent on the preelection advertising of the latvia first party linking the source of these fund to krājbanka and it former president al it

considered to constitute a misappropriation of the bank fund these fund had been spent on the party largescale advertising a the applicant had put it this money ha been stolen from the shareholder the nine article had also contained other information provided by the applicant that during al time in office there had been breach not only in relation to the advertising expense but also other breach in respect of banking operation payment without approval the administration of certificate account against the interest of the bank and the state the appellate court stated that the information contained in those article about the use of krājbankas fund and transaction had been provided by the applicant who had mentioned specific sum and that the article had contained reference to his statement the appellate court found that since the applicant had provided this information to nra journalist he had to bear responsibility for giving and disseminating false information the court held that this information had not corresponded to the fact and that this had been acknowledged by the applicant himself during the hearing before the firstinstance court see paragraph above this had also been confirmed by the result of the external audit and by the prosecution see paragraph and the court also held that the journalist had not had a responsibility to verify the accuracy of the provided information since the applicant status a the chairman of the supervisory board of krājbanka had created a legitimate expectation that the provided information wa correct lastly the court found that even if the margin of permissible criticism in respect of al a a member of parliament wa necessarily a wider one than would normally be the case the false information had nevertheless offended his honour and dignity a it had contained serious allegation of unlawful activity and had given the impression that al wa a dishonest person given the above and in view of the seriousness of the

statutory interest per annum in addition the court upheld the claim against preses nams alone in respect of one other article and ordered it to pay compensation in the amount of lvl approximately eur together with statutory interest per annum the applicant and preses nams were also ordered to pay al legal cost in the amount of lvl approximately eur and lvl approximately eur respectively the appellate court dismissed al claim against preses nams and mediju nams a regard all the other article that had not been based on any information provided by the applicant proceeding before the senate of the supreme court on june the applicant lodged an appeal on point of law with the senate of the supreme court augstākās tiesas senāts he did not contest that the information he had provided to the journalist had turned out not to be supported by evidence however this information had constituted his evaluation of the action taken by krājbankas management a a whole he had not directly mentioned al by name surname or his position when giving the information to the journalist his allegation regarding the misappropriation of krājbankas fund could only have infringed the interest of the bank a a legal entity it could not have offended the honour and dignity of certain executive who had been under an obligation to inform the supervisory board and the mass medium of the truth furthermore the applicant had provided the information in the form of a supposition by indicating that it still needed to be verified by the bank internal audit it wa the nra journalist who had linked the applicant report with the allegation of wrongdoing by al thus the applicant could not be held responsible for the manner in which the journalist had decided to present this information since he had had no mean of influencing this on january the senate of the supreme court delivered a new judgment which in essence upheld the appellate court judgment the relevant part of the judgement read a follows the appellate court conclusion that the applicant had disseminated defamatory and false information wa supported by the applicant own submission before the firstinstance court in which he admitted that he had provided incorrect information to the journalist the fact that this information wa not truthful wa confirmed by the audit agency and the prosecution the applicant in his appeal on point of law did not contest these finding he merely noted that he wa a source and could not influence the evaluation given by the journalist having examined the testimony of the nra journalist the appellate court found that the false information provided by the applicant had related not to krājbankas management a the applicant indicated but specifically to al a the then president of the bank thus infringing his honour and dignity the appellate court found that the journalist had had no reason to doubt the credibility of the information a it had been provided by the applicant in his capacity a chairman of the supervisory board of krājbanka and his position had undoubtedly created a legitimate expectation that this information wa true accordingly the appellate court rightly held that the journalist had had no obligation to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the applicant al had requested compensation in the amount of lvl from the applicant by granting his claim the appellate court taking into account the scope of the distributed information and it audience rightly considered it justified the senate of the supreme court also upheld the claim against preses nams alone in respect of one other article they held that al honour and dignity had not been offended in other article the appellate court had referred to the court caselaw and had taken into account al status and the fact that he had refused to offer comment the appellate court had correctly applied the relevant principle that the journalistic freedom also covered possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation the senate referred to a diena and ozoliņš v latvia no july in this regard referring to section a of the civil law and section of the law on the mass medium the senate of the supreme court

upheld by the senate of the supreme court on january had constituted an unjustified interference with his right to freedom of expression a provided in article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or right of others the government contested that argument a admissibility the court note that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submissionsa the applicant the applicant claimed that the interference with his right to freedom of expression even though it had been in accordance with law and had pursued a legitimate aim had not been proportionate the applicant maintained that the domestic court had failed to conduct a proper balancing exercise between the competing interest since they had not taken into account all of the relevant criterion established in the court caselaw he referred to axel springer ag v germany gc no february first of all his allegation contributed to a debate of general interest a they related to the manner in which the bank which wa partly owned by the state fund had been spent they also related to a political party which had obtained of the seat in parliament his allegation had not been directed against al a a private individual nor had he disclosed any detail of al personal life secondly his allegation about possible misappropriation of the bank fund were made on the basis on the applicant initial report which relied inter alia on the information provided by the marketing and economics department referring to novaya gazeta v voronezhe v russia no december he argued that the information that he had provided to the journalist had constituted a value judgment since he had explicitly told the journalist that this information still needed to be verified by the bank internal audit the fact that the respective information had later proved incorrect should not have affected this conclusion moreover the applicant had had a sufficient factual basis for this information namely his report on krājbankas advertising and marketing expense he believed that there had been solid ground for his allegation he considered that he had acted in good faith he admitted that his statement might have been considered provocative but they had not overstepped the permissible degree of criticism a the chairman of the supervisory board he had acted in the interest of the bank shareholder including the state and wa under a duty to inform the public about the supervisory board activity which would not have been the case had the matter concerned a private entity furthermore the applicant could not be held responsible for the manner in which the journalist had decided to report the information provided by him thirdly the applicant noted that the press had reported on al professional activity on a regular basis the applicant then cited further statement which had been reported in the other article published by nra see paragraph above but which had not been made by him he emphasised that those statement had not been found defamatory a they had either contained sufficient factual basis or had been considered a value judgment it wa his view that those publication showed that al activity had been controversial and that criticism had been directed at various activity related to his professional conduct fourthly it had to be taken into account that the published article had not caused any obstacle for al to be elected a a member of parliament and later to hold the position a the chairman of saeimas defence and home affair commission although the applicant allegation and criticism regarding al professional activity might have been unpleasant they had not harmed al reputation lastly the applicant submitted that the appellate court while awarding damage in the amount of lvl had failed to specify any ground for it decision to award this specific sum they had merely referred to the applicant position and had noted that this amount corresponds to the seriousness of the delict such reasoning wa in his view insufficient the applicant considered that he had been imposed with a severe sanction taking into account the economic situation in the country average net monthly salary at the material time had stood at eur lvl therefore the award had amounted to average monthly salary he also referred to the socalled talsi tragedy case where the nonpecuniary damage award in connection with an incident of june where several child had lost their life had been lvl see for more information elberte v latvia no echr b the government the government acknowledged that the impugned court decision had amounted to an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression however the interference had been prescribed by law and had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation of al a guaranteed by article of the convention referring to kasabova v bulgaria no april and axel springer ag cited above the government also claimed that the interference had been proportionate they maintained that the state must be given a certain margin of appreciation in striking the appropriate balance between the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life kasabova cited above first of all the government did not agree that the applicant allegation had contributed to a debate of public interest they agreed that the public had an interest in being informed about any criminal proceeding but emphasised that it had to be done observing the principle of presumption of innocence the applicant did not observe this principle a had provided the journalist with false and defamatory information similarly the public had the right to know about the use the fund partly owned by the state however the applicant conduct had created an adverse effect a he had mislead society with false information and injured the reputation of al secondly they argued that the information provided by the applicant had not constituted a value judgment but had been a statement of fact a established by the domestic court the government noted that the domestic court when examining al claim concerning all thirtyone article published by nra see paragraph et seq above had made a clear distinction between the comment made by the applicant and the opinion expressed by the journalist furthermore the applicant himself had admitted that the information provided by him to the journalist had been incorrect alternatively even if the information provided by the applicant had constituted a value judgment the government claimed that it had lacked a sufficient factual basis the government emphasised that the nine article in issue had been published between and october whereas already on october the supervisory board had received the first result of the internal audit dismissing the applicant allegation nor did the final report of october confirm the applicant allegation given the applicant professional qualification and previous experience he must have been aware that his allegation of the misappropriation of fund including the statement this is money that ha been stolen from the shareholder which could amount to such criminal offence a fraud misappropriation of fund or abuse of official authority could only be substantiated by confirmed result of internal or external audit even assuming that the applicant indeed believed that there had been solid ground for his allegation he did not retract those allegation a soon a he learned that they had not been confirmed by the internal audit either on or october nor did he retract them after receiving the result of an external audit in may the government concluded that the applicant allegation fell outside the limit of acceptable criticism and that he had not acted in good faith thirdly the government did not dispute that during his time in office a the president of the bank and throughout the preelection period al had acted in a public context they added however that he had not previously been held criminally liable for his professional or private activity also the applicant prior conduct had to be addressed they emphasised his professional qualification and previous experience and noted that he had to be aware of the fact that his allegation could only be disclosed if he had credible information fourthly the government reiterated that the domestic court had found the applicant liable for nine false and defamatory publication which in essence had been related to the same issue a stated by the government lvl wa transferred without documentation apparently for krājbankas advertising and marketing activity of which lvl went to the advertising agency z which also happened to be responsible for creating latvia first party preelection campaign lastly a regard the amount of compensation the domestic court had taken note of similar case examined by the court taking into account the applicant status the award wa not capable of having a chilling effect on the applicant the court assessmenta existence of an interference lawfulness and legitimate aim it is common ground between the party that the award of damage against the applicant amounted to an interference with his right to freedom of expression and that it wa prescribed by law the party also agreed that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the right of others namely the reputation of al what remains to be established is whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic societyb necessary in a democratic societyi general principle the court ha already had occasion to lay down the relevant principle which must guide it assessment and more importantly that of domestic court of necessity it ha thus identified a number of criterion within the context of balancing the competing right the relevant criterion have thus far been defined a the contribution to a debate of public interest the degree of notoriety of the person affected the subject of the news report the prior conduct of the person affected and the content form and consequence of the publication where it examines an application lodged under article the court will also examine the way in which the information wa obtained and it veracity a well a the severity of the sanction imposed see for recent authority medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no and echr with further reference and ärztekammer für wien and dorner v austria no february furthermore the court draw a distinction between statement of fact and value judgment the existence of fact can be demonstrated whereas the truth of value judgment is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article however where a statement amount to a value judgment the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement if there is not that value judgment may prove excessive in order to distinguish between a factual allegation and a value judgment it is necessary to take account of the circumstance of the case and the general tone of the remark bearing in mind that assertion about matter of public interest may on that basis constitute value judgment rather than statement of fact see morice v france gc no echr with further reference the court also emphasis that free election and freedom of expression particularly freedom of political debate together form the bedrock of any democratic system the two right are interrelated and operate to reinforce each other for that reason it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinion and information of all kind are permitted to circulate freely see for a recent authority cheltsova v russia no june with further reference however article doe not guarantee wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matter of serious public concern and relating to politician or public official see among other authority bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii it is open to the relevant state authority to adopt appropriate measure in order to react without excess to defamatory accusation that are devoid of foundation or formulated in bad faith moreover freedom of expression carry with it duty and responsibility and any person who chooses to disclose information must carefully verify to the extent permitted by the circumstance in question that it is accurate and reliable see guja v moldova gc no echr furthermore the more serious the allegation the higher the level of diligence that must be exercised before bringing it to the attention of the relevant authority or the public see medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above when the freedom of expression of person with public responsibility is at stake the duty and responsibility referred to in article are of particular importance in that regard an important aspect is the privileged position that person with public responsibility enjoy in accessing the medium owing to their position of authority see poyraz v turkey no december ii application of the relevant general principle to the present case the present case concern defamation proceeding against the applicant who wa in office a the chairman of the supervisory board of the bank which wa partly owned by the state he provided comment to the journalist regarding allegation of undocumented advertising and marketing expense that he had raised at the bank supervisory board meeting a a result during the month which preceded the parliamentary election nra published numerous article about the upcoming election including nine article referring to the applicant allegation which later turned out to be unfounded the court can accept that the applicant allegation were made in the context of a public debate prior to the parliamentary election and concerned al who wa one of the leader of a newly established political party and who stood for election also it wa undisputed in the domestic proceeding and before the court that al during his time in office a the president of the bank and throughout the preelection period had acted in a public context while the domestic court did not provide full analysis of the criterion laid down in the court caselaw see paragraph above the court doe not consider it necessary to examine this further because the crux of the present case is the question of whether the applicant allegation contained a factual basis that wa sufficient in view of the particular circumstance of the present case the court note that the party to the present case disagreed a to whether the applicant allegation of undocumented advertising and marketing expense in the bank constituted statement of fact or value judgment the domestic court reasoning in this respect wa rather succinct a they limited themselves to finding that the applicant allegation turned out to be unfounded which fact the applicant did not contest and had thus been false from the very beginning while the court considers that some of the applicant assertion could be regarded a constituting value judgement his pronouncement also included statement of fact susceptible of proof in any event the court is of the view that the issue that must be determined in the present case is whether there wa at least a sufficient factual basis for the applicant allegation the reasonableness of the effort made to verify the accuracy of the information disclosed must be determined in the light of the situation at the time that the statement were made rather than with the benefit of hindsight on the basis of the subsequent internal and external audit report see mutatis mutandis medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above the court also refers here to the duty and responsibility associated with freedom of expression see paragraph above and note their pertinence to the present case given the applicant public status under the domestic law a the chairman of the supervisory board of the partly stateowned bank a well a his own affirmation that he had the duty to inform the public of the supervisory board activity it is undisputed that the applicant allegation were based on his initial report that he had prepared for the purpose of the supervisory board meeting see paragraph above he had requested and received internal information from the marketing and economics department in this regard and informed the supervisory board about his personal finding of undocumented advertising and marketing expense in the bank he also commented on his allegation to the journalist who on the day after the supervisory board extraordinary meeting published the first article alleging that under the bank previous management large sum of money had been transferred without any documentation in order to finance advertising and marketing activity the applicant wa directly quoted a stating that somebody is receiving this paid money back and this is money that ha been stolen from the shareholder in later newspaper article the applicant wa also quoted a saying it is possible that this is the money that provided the foundation for the latvia first party sizable advertising campaign these statement made by the applicant see also paragraph above contained serious allegation the senate of the supreme court relying on the journalist testimony held that the applicant allegation had specifically concerned al and not a claimed by the applicant the bank management a a whole what is in issue in the present case is whether the applicant exceeded the limit of acceptable criticism by commenting on his allegation to the journalist at the material time the court agrees with the domestic court that the limit of acceptable criticism are wider for politician than in relation to private individual moreover candidate in parliamentary election are exposed to the widest scrutiny by the press and by the public that being said in view of the consequence that serious allegation of misconduct may have on public opinion and potentially on the result of election duty and responsibility inherent in freedom of expression require particularly close scrutiny a to whether there wa a sufficient factual basis for such serious allegation the applicant initial report not having been made available the court note several factor which call into question the way in which the applicant acted when commenting on his allegation to the journalist in the present case given his position his knowledge of the relevant event and the point in time at which he made his allegation first of all the applicant must have been aware of his status under domestic law a a public official and that the journalist could in accordance with section of the law on the mass medium rely on his statement see paragraph and above the domestic court established that the journalist had had no reason to doubt the credibility of the information provided by the applicant owing to his position a the chairman of the supervisory board indeed the journalist could not further verify the applicant allegation given that they concerned the bank internal document and did not appear to have been publicly available compare bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above secondly the court note that the applicant formed his view concerning undocumented advertising and marketing expense after consulting the head of the marketing and economics department it is unclear given the seriousness of the allegation why he did not solicit any relevant information from the internal audit department before giving his comment to the press the court note that it took only around fourteen day for the internal audit department to carry out it preliminary verification of the applicant allegation and to dismiss them nonetheless the applicant commented on his allegation to the press without awaiting the outcome of the internal audit which wa still ongoing when he made those comment thus the applicant knowingly chose to disclose unverified information to the journalist thirdly the applicant comment were made during the month preceding the election at the time when a political debate wa at it peak such allegation were capable of carrying a certain weight on public opinion about the newly established party and one of it leader given the applicant position at the bank and the nature of his allegation the court doe not consider that the applicant could rely on the degree of exaggeration or even provocation that can usually be used in the exercise of freedom of expression in the context of a political debate see mutatis mutandis petrina v romania no october compare also standard verlagsgesellschaft mb h v austria no no february therefore given the circumstance of the case the need for a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis wa particularly relevant lastly it appears that the applicant took no step to voice his disagreement a press release official comment or retraction etc with the publication of further article citing him a a source and providing further quote of his statement when a early a october the first result of the internal audit were made available to the supervisory board finding no proof for undocumented advertising and marketing expense in the bank a noted by the government he appears not to have taken any further step to remedy the situation after the final result had been made available by the internal audit and external audit in view of the foregoing the court concludes that the applicant initial report on the basis of which he made comment on such serious allegation a misappropriation of the bank fund by it former president who wa a candidate in the parliamentary election contained no sufficient factual basis even if the applicant comment were to be regarded a constituting value judgment the applicant accordingly overstepped the limit of acceptable criticism in relation to al the court is therefore satisfied that the disputed interference wa supported by relevant and sufficient reason and that the authority of the respondent state struck a fair balance between the applicant freedom of expression on the one hand and al interest in protection of his reputation on the other hand thus acting within their margin of appreciation compare poyraz cited above accordingly there ha been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the complaint under article of the convention admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on june pursuant to rule and of the rule of court claudia westerdiek angelika nußberger registrar president,,,

the judicial investigation wa subsequently transferred to paris where the case wa assigned in late october to m m assisted by mr ll both investigating judge at the paris tribunal de grande instance in march the investigating judge visited djibouti without the civil party while mr borrel wa challenging the suicide conclusion a witness a former member of the djiboutian presidential guard who had found asylum in belgium came forward in december and lent support to the theory of premeditated murder implicating the former chief of staff of the president of djibouti his testimony proved highly controversial and wa widely reported in the press and other medium in january the investigating judge m m interviewed the witness in brussels after which he challenged her impartiality alleging that she had put pressure on him to withdraw his testimony in the context of the judicial investigation in respect of the premeditated murder charge three professional union including the union syndicale de magistrats the usm applied on february to be joined to the case a civil party lastly in early march the investigating judge accompanied by the director of the paris institute of forensic medicine

application had been turned down on june the case wa withdrawn from the two investigating judge by the paris court of appeal a it regarded a unjustified their refusal to order a new visit to djibouti with the participation of the civil party the case wa transferred to another investigating judge mr pb criminal proceeding against the applicant the applicant is mr borrels lawyer on july a general meeting of the judge of the paris tribunal de grande instance held in paris examined among other thing the situation of the judge m m it had been announced in the press that the minister of justice had referred to the conseil supérieur de la magistrature national legal service council a dossier concerning the church of scientology which she had been working on a investigating judge and in which certain shortcoming had been noted during that meeting a judge mr jm stated a follows we are not prohibited a grassroots judge from saying that we are friend of m m it is not forbidden to say that m m ha our support and trust on september the applicant and a fellow lawyer wrote a letter to the minister of justice in connection with the judicial investigation into judge borrels death they stated that they were complaining again to the minister of justice about the conduct of judge m and ll which wa completely at odds with the principle of impartiality and fairness they asked for an investigation to be carried out by the general inspectorate of judicial service into the numerous shortcoming which had been brought to light in the course of the judicial investigation they added that after the case had been withdrawn from investigating judge m and ll by a judgment of the indictment division of the paris court of appeal dated june all of the evidence had been transmitted to the new judge on june noting that a video recording made during an onsite visit by the investigating judge unaccompanied by the civil party wa not in the file thus transmitted the lawyer protested about this to the new judge on august they pointed out that the new judge had received that evidence on the same day and in their view this showed that judge m and ll had been sitting on this videocassette also forgetting to place it under seal for over a month after the case wa withdrawn from them they further stated that the judge on opening the cassette cover had discovered an envelope containing a letter addressed to judge m about which they commented that it content wa revealing and the literary quality of this letter wa such that it obliged them to reproduce it for the minister of justice in full especially a it came from the public prosecutor of the republic of djibouti mr d the letter read a follows salut marie paule je tenvoie comme convenu la cassette vidéo du transport au goubet jespère que limage serum satisfaisante jai regardé lémission sans aucun doute sur tfjai pu constater à nouveau combien madame borrel et s avocats sont décidés à continuer leur entreprise de manipulation je tappellerai bientôt passe le bonjour à roger sil est rentré de même quà jcdje tembrasse djama hi marie paule a agreed i am sending you the videocassette of the goubet site visit i hope the picture will be clear enough i watched the show without any doubt on tfi noticed once again how mr borrel and her lawyer were determined to carry on their manipulation ill call you soon say hello to roger if he back and also to jcdbest wish djama the lawyer continued their letter a follows the form and substance of the letter reveal moreover a surprising and regrettable complicit intimacy between the french judge and the djibouti public prosecutor a judicial authority placed directly under the government of which the head is very openly and very seriously suspected of being the instigator of bernard borrels murder this type of information is clearly capable of explaining the firm and constant determination of the investigating judge to stop the civil party and their lawyer from attending the reenactment held in djibouti a you are aware this particularly delicate case concern the death of a french judge and his widow herself a judge can not accept such conduct on the part of other judge in disregard of the most basic rule not only those of the procedure but also those requiring respect for the victim in those circumstance we are obliged to bring this matter to your attention to seek your assurance that all the shortcoming will be fully scrutinised the newspaper le monde published an article dated september entitled borrel case judge m impartiality called into question the journalist reported in the article that mr borrels lawyer had vigorously criticised judge m to the minister of justice it wa stated that the applicant and his colleague had accused the judge of conduct which wa completely at odds with the principle of impartiality and fairness and that the judge seemed to have omitted to register an item from the case file and to transmit it to her successor the article further stated judge m and ll had been sitting on this videocassette protest the lawyer olivier morice and also forgot to place it under seal for over a month after the case wa withdrawn from them the article continued a follows to make matter worse in the envelope judge p found a handwritten and rather friendly note by d the public prosecutor of djibouti the wording of the note found inside the cassette cover wa then reproduced in the article which added mr borrels lawyer are obviously furious this letter show the extent of the connivance which exists between the djibouti public prosecutor and the french judge exclaims mr morice and one can not but find it outrageous it wa then stated that the lawyer had asked the minister of justice to initiate an investigation by the general inspectorate of judicial service on and october the two judge in question lodged a criminal complaint for public defamation of a civil servant against the editorinchief of le monde the journalist who had written the article and the applicant applying to join the proceeding a civil party the defendant were committed to stand trial before the nanterre tribunal de grande instance by an order of the investigating judge dated october the complaint concerned the following passage of the article published on september she judge m is accused by lawyer olivier morice and ld of conduct which is completely at odds with the principle of impartiality and fairness and seems to have omitted to register an item from the case file and to transmit it to her successor judge m and ll had been sitting on this cassette protest olivier morice and also forgot to place it under seal for over a month after the case wa withdrawn from them to make matter worse in the envelope judge p found a handwritten and rather friendly note mr borrels lawyer are obviously furious this letter show the extent of the connivance which exists between the djibouti public prosecutor and the french judge exclaims mr morice and one can not but find it outrageous the court hearing took place on april and the judgment wa delivered on june the applicant first invoked the immunity provided for under section of the freedom of the press act of july the court rejected that argument finding that the action taken by the applicant and his colleague in writing to the minister of justice could not be regarded a connected to judicial proceeding or document adduced before a court of law within the meaning of section of that act the court then examined whether the comment at issue were defamatory it noted at the outset that this had not been meaningfully disputed and that the applicant stood by the content of his allegation that he considered well founded concerning the first passage the court noted that the quotation wa correct the letter to the minister having been included in the case file it added that the accusation of impartiality sic and unfairness proffered against a judge clearly constituted a particularly defamatory allegation because it wa tantamount to calling into question her quality her moral and professional rigour and ultimately her capacity to discharge her duty a a judge a regard the cassette it noted that the comment reflected at least some negligence in the handling of the judicial investigation and also cast doubt on the professional integrity of the two investigating judge it added that read a a whole the comment suggested that the cassette had only been included in the proceeding because it had been demanded by the lawyer then by the judge himself and that it had been necessary a it were to thwart and denounce a sort of obstruction on the part of judge m and ll it took the view that such assertion had to be classified a defamatory a they necessarily impugned a person honour and reputation within the meaning of section of the freedom of the press act a regard the last of the impugned passage the court noted that the defamatory weight of the term connivance wa the only aspect to have given rise to debate it noted that this term followed a number of other defamatory passage of which the highly negative wording and one can not but find it outrageous proved the deliberately strong connotation of the word connivance according to the court the use of that word clearly and directly suggested that on account of their good relation with the djibouti public prosecutor judge m and ll had been collaborating with that official of a foreign country in investigating the case in a partial and unfair manner in breach of the basic principle of law and of judicial office the court found that the defamatory nature of those view wa exacerbated by the subsequent indication in the article that the lawyer had asked the minister of justice to initiate an investigation by the general inspectorate of judicial service thus implying that they had a serious basis on which to substantiate such an accusation a to the applicant guilt the court noted that the law of july provided that a person supplying defamatory information to a journalist in the knowledge that it would be published could be convicted for instigation of public defamation the court noted that in the present case the applicant had confirmed at the hearing that he had spoken on the telephone with the journalist who had drafted the article and had made the comment a reported the court concluded that it wa established that the applicant had supplied information to a journalist of the daily newspaper le monde for the purpose of publication making comment of which the defamatory nature wa patent a to the applicant offer to bring evidence the court pointed out that in order to be admitted the evidence had to be perfect and complete and to relate directly to all the accusation found to be defamatory a regard the shortcoming in the judicial investigation the court noted that it wa still in progress and that the judgment of june had expressed disapproval with the refusal by the judge concerned to proceed with the reenactment requested by the civil party and had acted thereon by ordering the case to be withdrawn from them it took the view however that it could not be inferred that all the criticism made in open court about the handling of the judicial investigation should be regarded a founded a regard the retention of the cassette the court noted that no offer of evidence had been seriously made in order to establish any professional misconduct or dishonest conduct on the part of the investigating judge lastly a to the term connivance the court stressed that a possible convergence of opinion between participant in the judicial process without it precise extent having been determined did not in any way prove the existence of a culpable complicity with the aim of distorting the investigation procedure it concluded that the applicant had failed in all his offer to bring evidence in support of his good faith the applicant referred to the duty that were inherent in his mission of defending client and the result obtained in response to the request of the civil party since the withdrawal of the case from judge m and ll the court refused however to admit his defence of good faith finding that the highly virulent attack on the professional and moral integrity of the investigating judge clearly overstepped the right of legitimately admissible free criticism the court thus found mr morice guilty of instigating the public defamation of judge m and ll it sentenced him to a fine of euro eur and ordered him to pay jointly with the journalist and publication director of le monde eur to each of the two judge the court further ordered that an announcement be published in the newspaper le monde at their shared expense all the party to the proceeding appealed against that judgment the versailles court of appeal delivered it judgment on may it held that judge lls appeal wa timebarred and upheld the three conviction for defamation against judge m it increased the amount of the fine imposed on the applicant codefendant from to euro and to euro respectively however it confirmed the amount of the fine imposed on the applicant and that of the damage awarded and also the order to have an announcement published in le monde in a judgment of october on appeal by the applicant and judge ll the court of cassation finding that the reasoning wa inconsistent and that judge lls appeal wa not timebarred quashed the court of appeal judgment in it entirety it remitted the case to the rouen court of appeal which thus had to rule on the criminal and civilparty action against the three defendant in relation to judge ll and on the criminal and civil action against the applicant alone in relation to judge m after a number of adjournment the hearing before the rouen court of appeal wa held on april in it judgment of july that court looked again at the defamatory nature of the impugned comment a regard the conduct of judge m the court found that to say about an investigating judge that in the handling of a case she had shown conduct which wa completely at odds with the principle of impartiality and fairness or in other word conduct incompatible with professional ethic and her judicial oath wa a particularly defamatory accusation because it wa tantamount to accusing her of lacking integrity and of deliberately failing in her duty a a judge thus questioning her capacity to discharge those duty a to the delay in the transmission of the cassette the court noted that the applicant comment not only accused the judge of negligence in the handling of the case thereby discrediting the professional competence of the judge but above all implied that the latter had kept hold of the cassette after the case wa withdrawn from them with the intention at least of causing obstruction allegedly it wa only because the lawyer had raised the matter with p followed by that judge request to judge m that the item of evidence had been obtained and finally transmitted on august the court of appeal added that such assertion attributing to those judge a deliberate failure to perform the duty inherent in their office and a lack of integrity in the fulfilment of their obligation constituted factual accusation which impugned their honour and reputation it found this to be all the more true a the applicant referring to the handwritten note from the public prosecutor of djibouti had emphasised this atmosphere of suspicion and the negligent conduct of the judge by stating that this document proved the extent of the connivance between them and the prosecutor the court noted on that point that the word thus used implied that on account of those good relation judge m had been able to conceal the truth and conduct her investigation in a partial and unfair manner in breach of professional ethic and the fundamental principle governing the office of judge the court added that such an allegation accusing the two judge of a total breach of the duty inherent in their office represented in itself a serious attack on their honour and reputation it merely served to confirm the defamatory nature of the previous comment especially a the article added that the applicant had asked the minister of justice for an inspection by the general inspectorate of judicial service the court of appeal concluded that the offending passage characterised the offence of public defamation against civil servant a to the applicant offer to bring evidence the court of appeal referring in part to the argument of the court below took the view that none of the item produced showed on the part of the judge any unfair or partial conduct any failure to perform the duty inherent in their office or any lack of integrity in the handling of the case concerning the death of judge borrel it concluded that the veracity of the defamatory allegation had not been established a regard the applicant defence of good faith the court noted that he had referred to the duty that were inherent in his mission of defending client the result obtained in the case since the change of investigating judge and the judicial decision taken thereafter it found however that at the time of the article publication the highly virulent attack on the professional and moral integrity of the two judge in comment that seriously questioned their impartiality and intellectual honesty clearly overstepping the right to free criticism wa no longer of any procedural interest because the case had already been withdrawn from them the court found that the particularly defamatory comment made by the applicant in the press against the two judge revealed by their excessive nature the intensity of the conflict between him and in particular judge m it considered the comment to amount to an ex post facto settling of score a shown by their inclusion a the applicant had wished in an article published in le monde on september according to the court on that date the applicant could not have been unaware that the investigation division of the paris court of appeal had just begun to examine at his request a lawyer acting for the civil party the case of the church of scientology in which m a investigating judge in the case wa suspected of being responsible for the disappearance of document it concluded that this showed on the part of the applicant personal animosity and an intention to discredit those judge in particular judge m with whom he had been in conflict in various case thus ruling out his good faith consequently the court of appeal upheld the judgment of the court below found the applicant guilty of instigating the offence of defamation against a civil servant sentenced him to a fine of eur and jointly with his two codefendant awarded eur in damage to each of the civil party it also ordered the publication of an announcement in le monde the defendant and judge m lodged an appeal on point of law against that judgment the applicant relied in particular on article of the convention arguing that the immunity provided for in section of the freedom of the press act protected the lawyer in respect of any oral or written comment made in the context of any type of judicial proceeding in particular of a disciplinary nature it followed in his submission that the letter of september to the minister of justice for the purpose of asking the national legal service council conseil supérieur de la magistrature to take action against two judge who had been responsible for investigating the case in question fell within the context of the defence of the civil party interest accordingly in his view the court of appeal had not been entitled to refuse to grant immunity from suit in respect of the allegedly defamatory comment contained in that letter on the ground that it did not constitute an act of referral that could be covered by the term pleading in section of the abovementioned act on that point the court of cassation found that the court of appeal had justified it decision by taking the view that the fact of making public the letter to the minister of justice seeking an investigation by the general inspectorate of judicial service into the shortcoming attributed to the two investigating judge did not constitute an act of referral to the national legal service council and wa not part of any proceeding involving the exercise of defence right before a court of law the applicant further relied on article of the convention asserting that the impugned comment concerned a court case that had for a long time received medium coverage and the questionable manner in which the investigation had been conducted having regard to the importance of the subject of general interest in the context of which the comment had been made the court of appeal wa not entitled to find that he had overstepped the bound of his freedom of expression he contended that good faith wa to be assessed in the light of the impugned comment that had been published he added that the mere fact that he had had a disagreement with one of the judge in the context of another set of proceeding did not prove that he wa driven by any personal animosity lastly he argued that opinion expressed about the functioning of a basic institution of the state like the handling of a criminal investigation were not subject to a duty of prudence in the expression of thought the court of cassation took the view that the court of appeal had justified it decision while everyone had the right to freedom of expression and while the public had a legitimate interest in receiving information on criminal proceeding and the functioning of the court the exercise of those freedom entailed duty and responsibility and could be subject a in the present case where the admissible limit of freedom of expression in criticising the action of judge had been overstepped to restriction or sanction prescribed by law which constituted measure that were necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation and right of others it dismissed the appeal by a judgment of november the bench which gave that judgment included in particular mr jm see paragraph above ii relevant domestic law the relevant provision of the freedom of the press act of july read a follows

give reason it shall be deposited in the registry the assistance of a lawyer is not compulsory article the competent section shall rule within one month from the filing of the application with the registry after receiving the observation of the judge whose withdrawal is sought the procedure shall otherwise be governed by the provision of book ii title xx of the code of civil procedure the code

judge may be appointed even ex parte to perform the necessary act article a request for the withdrawal of a member of the court of cassation shall be examined by a section other than that to which the case ha been allocated designated by the president of the court the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant alleged that there had been a violation of article of the convention and submitted that his case had not been heard fairly in an impartial tribunal a regard the proceeding before the court of cassation he complained that mr jm who wa on the bench which ruled on his appeal had previously expressed his support publicly for judge m at the general meeting of judge of the paris tribunal de grande instance on july the relevant part of article read a follows in the determination of any criminal charge against him everyone is entitled to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law a admissibility the government argued that the applicant had not exhausted internal remedy within the meaning of article of the convention they submitted that the applicant could have requested the withdrawal of mr jm on the ground of his lack of impartiality they referred to article and of the code of criminal procedure and explained that the procedure for requesting a judge withdrawal wa straightforward a the relevant application giving reason had to be filed in the registry of the court of cassation by the requesting party or lawyer the government added that it wa an appropriate remedy since in accordance with the code of civil procedure the application for withdrawal had suspensive effect a soon a he became aware of the request the judge had to stand down until the ruling on his withdrawal they denied that the applicant had not discovered until reading the judgment that mr jm had been sitting in the case they explained that the proceeding were held before a bench of which the member had been designated by the president of the court and that the applicant must have or could have known who they were they appended to their observation the order of the president of the court of cassation dated january stipulating inter alia that mr jm would sit in the criminal division from february onwards they added that since september lawyer at the conseil détat and court of cassation were immediately informed in writing when a case wa referred to a full section rather than a reduced bench of the development in the proceeding moreover a few week before the hearing the lawyer were informed by a notice from the prosecutor officer of the date when their case wa to be heard and they were entitled to present oral argument should they deem it necessary they produced a copy of the online workflow for the applicant appeal summarising the various stage of the court of cassation proceeding together with the report by the reporting judge both referring to examination by a reduced bench they submitted that the applicant had thus had the necessary time to file a request for withdrawal the government lastly pointed out that the lawyer at the conseil détat and court of cassation could not have failed to notice the presence of mr jm at the hearing when he had made his oral submission it would still have been possible at that stage to lodge an application for the judge withdrawal but he had not done so accordingly in the government submission a party which had not sought a judge withdrawal before the close of the proceeding when it could have done so wa presumed to have unequivocally waived that right the government referred on this point to the court caselaw and emphasised that the court had already found the application for withdrawal to be an effective remedy the applicant submitted that in the present case neither he nor his lawyer had been able to know that mr jm would be sitting he pointed out that the document adduced by the government showed on the contrary that mr jm wa not supposed to sit in that hearing first the judge report filed on july stated that a draft had been drawn up and examination by a reduced bench proposed secondly the online workflow for the applicant case indicated next to the date of october hearing section reduced bench procedure the applicant explained that the reduced bench wa a bench of three judge from the section concerned the president of the division the doyen senior member and the reporting judge a mr jm wa none of those the applicant could not have expected him to sit in his case ultimately it wa a larger full section bench made up of ten judge including mr jm which heard the applicant appeal without his lawyer having been informed he argued that he had thus been misled about the real composition of the court of cassation and had thus been deprived of the right to seek the withdrawal of a judge the applicant also produced three notice to lawyer from the registry of the criminal division of the court of cassation dated september and and october respectively in which it wa indicated that the case would be or had been examined by a reduced bench on october he observed that the proceeding before the court of cassation were written and that his lawyer had not been obliged to attend the hearing of october he concluded that he had not had any reason to call for the withdrawal of a judge who wa not supposed to be a member of the bench hearing his appeal he added that it wa the final judgment of november which had revealed to him the precise composition of the division at the time of it deliberation the court reiterates that the purpose of article is to afford the contracting state the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violation alleged against them before those allegation are submitted to the convention institution see for example remli v france april report of judgment and decision ii and selmouni v france gc no echr v a regard an allegation to the effect that a court ha not satisfied the condition of independence or impartiality required by article of the convention the possibility of lodging an application for withdrawal under french law can be regarded a an effective remedy for the purpose of article of the convention and where the impartiality of a given member of a court is in issue the withdrawal procedure must be implemented see huglo lepage et associés scp v france dec no march and roussin v france dec no october the court note that in the present case it can be seen from the document submitted both by the applicant and by the government that the case wa supposed to be examined by a reduced bench of section i of the criminal division of the court of cassation the report of the reporting judge dated july the court of cassations online workflow for the case and the three notice issued on september and and october respectively thus all mention that the case wa being heard by a reduced bench even in the last two of those document which were sent after the date of the hearing consequently mr jm who wa neither the division president nor the doyen nor the reporting judge wa not supposed to sit in this case and the applicant had no reason to believe that he would a regard moreover the possibility of raising this point at the hearing the court note that the proceeding before the court of cassation are mainly written and that there is no evidence in the file to show that the applicant lawyer had been present at the hearing in those circumstance the court take the view that the applicant had no reason to request the withdrawal of mr jm and had thus been unable to use the remedy advocated by the government the objection raised by the government must thus be rejected moreover the court find that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission on the merit the applicant took the view that the government had sought in vain to minimise the position taken by mr jm at the general meeting of the paris tribunal de grande instance of july he indicated that those comment although they had been made in the context of disciplinary proceeding against judge m in the case concerning the church of scientology revealed that mr jms relation with her were close and supportive a expressed in a broad manner and not being confined to the scientology case see paragraph above he added that the rouen court of appeal had used that case against him the applicant further observed that he had also been the lawyer acting for certain civil party in the scientology case and had triggered the disciplinary proceeding against judge m because he had referred to the minister of justice the difficulty he had encountered with her in that case see paragraph above the government for their part emphasised that mr jm had made the comment at issue almost ten year earlier when he had been a judge at the paris tribunal de grande instance they added that those comment had been made in a different court and context that of a case concerning the church of scientology and could not be regarded a a general and unconditional expression of support for judge m the court assessmenta general principle the principle emanating from the caselaw on such matter were summarised by the court a follows in the case of micallef v malta gc no echr impartiality normally denotes the absence of prejudice or bias and it existence or otherwise can be tested in various way according to the court constant caselaw the existence of impartiality for the purpose of article must be determined according to a subjective test where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge that is whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case and also according to an objective test that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself and among other aspect it composition offered sufficient guarantee to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of it impartiality see inter alia fey v austria february and series a no a and wettstein v switzerland no echr xii a to the subjective test the principle that a tribunal shall be presumed to be free of personal prejudice or partiality is longestablished in the caselaw of the court see for example kyprianou v cyprus gc no echr xiii the court ha held that the personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary see wettstein cited above a regard the type of proof required the court ha for example sought to ascertain whether a judge ha displayed hostility or ill will for personal reason see de cubber v belgium october series a no in the vast majority of case raising impartiality issue the court ha focused on the objective test however there is no watertight division between subjective and objective impartiality since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgiving a to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer objective test but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction subjective test see kyprianou cited above thus in some case where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge subjective impartiality the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee see pullar v the united kingdom june report iii a to the objective test it must be determined whether quite apart from the judge conduct there are ascertainable fact which may raise doubt a to his impartiality this implies that in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or a body sitting a a bench lack impartiality the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive what is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified see wettstein cited above and ferrantelli and santangelo v italy august report iii the objective test mostly concern hierarchical or other link between the judge and other actor in the proceeding see court martial case for example miller and others v the united kingdom no and october see also case regarding the dual role of a judge for example mežnarić v croatia no july and wettstein cited above where the lawyer representing the applicant opponent subsequently judged the applicant in a single set of proceeding and overlapping proceeding respectively which objectively justify misgiving a to the impartiality of the tribunal and thus fail to meet the convention standard under the objective test see kyprianou cited above it must therefore be decided in each individual case whether the relationship in question is of such a nature and degree a to indicate a lack of impartiality on the part of the tribunal see pullar cited above in this respect even appearance may be of a certain importance or in other word justice must not only be done it must also be seen to be done see de cubber cited above what is at stake is the confidence which the court in a democratic society must inspire in the public thus any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw see castillo algar v spain october report viiib application of those principle to the present case the court note that in the present case the applicant called into question the impartiality of judge jm it is established that at the general meeting of the judge of the paris tribunal de grande instance on july jm made the following statement about judge m after shortcoming had been observed in her handling of the investigation into a case concerning the church of scientology we are not prohibited a grassroots judge from saying that we are friend of m m it is not forbidden to say that m m ha our support and trust it further note that the applicant wa precisely the lawyer acting for certain civil party in the scientology case and that he himself at the time had complained to the minister of justice about the difficulty he had encountered with judge m in the course of the judicial investigation in the proceeding at issue in the present case judge m had filed a complaint a a civil party in particular against the applicant who had made statement about how the investigation wa being handled in the case concerning judge borrel the court doe not find any evidence in the file to show that in the present case judge jm displayed any personal bias it will thus examine the case in term of objective impartiality it observes that judge jm sat on the bench of the criminal division of the court of cassation which ruled on appeal by judge m and the applicant stemming from a dispute between them and which dismissed those appeal thereby upholding the applicant conviction nine year earlier jm had publicly expressed his support for and trust in judge m in connection with another case in which she had been the investigating judge and the applicant had been acting for a civil party even though jms expressed position dated back several year it is nevertheless true that judge m wa already investigating the borrel case at the time when jm made his statement that this case had major medium and political repercussion and that it ha since undergone numerous development moreover the rouen court of appeal in it judgment of july itself pointed out that the church of scientology case in which judge m wa suspected of being responsible for the disappearance of evidence had been referred to the investigation division of the paris court of appeal upon an application by the applicant two day before the publication of the offending article in which that fact had been mentioned the court thus find that there wa clear opposition between the applicant and judge m both in the case for which she had received the support of judge j m and in that where j m wa sitting a a judge of the court of cassation it is also noteworthy that jms support had been expressed in an official context at the general meeting of the judge of the paris tribunal de grande instance and that it wa quite general in nature this is sufficient for the court to come to the conclusion that in the circumstance of the case serious doubt could be raised a to the impartiality of the court of cassation and the applicant fear in that connection could be regarded a objectively justified there ha accordingly been a violation of article of the convention in the present case ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained of a violation of his right to freedom of expression he relied on article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court find that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission without disputing the fact that the interference constituted by his conviction wa prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim the applicant submitted that the restriction imposed on him wa unnecessary and disproportionate referring to the court caselaw in such matter the applicant indicated that a regard criminal proceeding it wa essential for journalist to be able to obtain information from legallyassisted civil party party who were not in fact bound by the secrecy of the judicial investigation he added that it wa thus important for the civil party lawyer to be able to express criticism even harsh one a otherwise the information accessible to the public would be unreasonably restricted the applicant submitted that the investigation into judge borrels death wa part of a sensitive criminal case which had received significant medium coverage a the court had already had occasion to observe and the circumstance were such that it raised political and diplomatic issue which warranted a greater degree of information in particular on the subject of how the judicial investigation wa proceeding he referred to july and sarl libération v france no echr in his view when reason of state were at stake in a given case the lawyer freedom of speech had to be at least equal to that of the journalist and the press because faced with the obstruction of the state authority the lawyer wa the crucial goad in making sure that the truth wa not stifled he considered it important even ex post facto to inform the public about the reason underlying any shortcoming in the judicial investigation like those in the case relating to the death of judge borrel he added that it wa therefore a a lawyer and solely for the defence of his client interest that he had explained to the journalist why he and his colleague had called upon the minister of justice seeking an investigation by the general inspectorate of judicial service this being the only possible course of action in those circumstance the applicant wa of the opinion that the comment he had made to the journalist were reasonable and that while he had harshly criticised the judge action he had not insulted them or impugned their honour but had shown the dignity and moderation required of a lawyer he added that he had been wrongly accused of being driven by personal animosity and of seeking to discredit the judge he stated that the action he had taken in the scientology case had been successful because the indictment division had withdrawn the case from judge m and the french state had been ordered to pay compensation to the victim family for gross negligence on the part of the court a to the proportionality of the sanction the applicant emphasised that the harshness of the penalty imposed on him both civil and criminal wa such a to deter him from speaking in the medium to denounce any shortcoming in the judicial system he concluded that the restriction on his freedom of expression wa not necessary in a democratic society or proportionate to the aim pursued the government for their part also took the view that the interference wa prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim a to the necessity of the interference they referred to the court caselaw and observed that in the present case the need to limit freedom of expression stemmed not only from the particularly harsh comment but also from the context in which they had been made they further emphasised the sensitive nature of the investigation into judge borrels death and the significant medium interest in the case they did not deny that the question of general interest covered by the press included those concerning the functioning of the judicial system or that the press constituted a mean whereby public opinion could ensure that judge assumed their responsibility in accordance with their mission the government observed however that a lawyer freedom of expression could not be equal to that of a journalist and that it could be subject to restriction lawyer a holder of legal office were required to contribute to the proper functioning of the justice system and to the confidence that it wa supposed to inspire they thus had to show a degree of restraint in the exercise of their duty the state therefore had to be able to impose sanction where such confidence and the proper functioning of the court were undermined they emphasised that it could be seen from the offending passage that they were directed in an unequivocal manner at two judge in term that impugned their honour in the government submission the applicant had not merely expressed a general criticism of the court but had deliberately made biased comment without the slightest prudence his remark had not contributed in any way to an exchange of idea and had gone further than mere participation in a debate on the functioning of the justice system the government further observed that the domestic court had carefully scrutinised the offending comment and had found them unquestionably to cause harm to the reputation of the two judge by suggesting that they had failed in their professional duty and obligation they had thus overstepped the bound of admissible criticism they added that the accusation suggesting that there might have been some concealment of evidence from the case file on the part of judge m were particularly serious in that they were capable of engaging the judge criminal liability they should thus have been supported by particularly wellsubstantiated and precise information the government indicated that the domestic court assessed the defence of good faith in the light of the provision of article of the convention and the four criterion that had to be fulfilled concurrently the legitimacy of the aim pursued the absence of personal animosity the seriousness of the investigation carried out or of the evidence obtained by the author of the comment and the prudence shown in expressing them in the present case the court of appeal had held that those condition were not satisfied and that the attack had amounted to a settling of score in the government submission the applicant could not argue that the offending comment made outside the courtroom constituted a defence strategy a there were other mean by which he could have expressed his view the applicant had in fact used those mean and had obtained in a judgment of june the withdrawal of the case from the two judge they added that the applicant had not been at fault for expressing himself outside the courtroom but for using excessive comment whereas he could have criticised the handling of the case in harsh term without impugning the honour of state official the government therefore took the view that the ground given by the domestic court in rejecting the defence of good faith had been pertinent and sufficient and that the absence of moderation and prudence had rendered the interference necessary a to the proportionality of the sanction the government argued that it could not be regarded a excessive or capable of having a chilling effect on the exercise of freedom of expression the government concluded that the interference had been necessary in a democratic society in order to ensure the protection of right set out in paragraph of article of the convention the court assessment the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient and whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see among other authority lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc no and echr xi it reiterates in this connection that in order to ass the justification of an impugned statement a distinction need to be made between statement of fact and value judgment while the existence of fact can be demonstrated the truth of value judgment is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article the classification of a statement a a fact or a a value judgment is a matter which in the first place fall within the margin of appreciation of the national authority in particular the domestic court however even where a statement amount to a value judgment there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it failing which it will be excessive see for example lindon otchakovsky laurens and july cited above moreover a regard the impugned comment the court reiterates that it always ha regard to the special role of the judiciary in society a the guarantor of justice judge and prosecutor must enjoy public confidence if they are to be successful in carrying out their duty it may therefore prove necessary to protect them against destructive attack that are essentially unfounded especially a they are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying see rizos and daskas v greece no may in addition the court observes that the special status of lawyer give them a key position in the administration of justice a intermediary between the public and the court such a position explains the usual restriction on the conduct of member of the bar see casado coca v spain february series a no a however a the court ha previously had occasion to state lawyer are entitled to freedom of expression too and to comment in public on the administration of justice provided that their criticism doe not overstep certain bound see amihalachioaie v moldova no echr iii in that connection account must be taken of the need to strike the right balance between the various interest involved which include the public right to receive information about matter of general interest or the functioning of the judicial system the requirement of the proper administration of justice the dignity of the legal profession and the reputation of the judiciary see schöpfer v switzerland may report iii in the present case the court note that the applicant made statement to a journalist from the daily newspaper le monde and they were reported in an article published on september under the headline borrel case judge m impartiality called into question in that article mr borrels lawyer including the applicant accused the investigating judge of displaying conduct which wa completely at odds with the principle of impartiality and fairness and of having with her colleague omitted to register an item from the case file and to transmit it to her successor after referring to a note from the djibouti public prosecutor addressed to judge m in rather friendly term the article stated that the lawyer including the applicant were obviously furious and that according to the latter that document demonstrated the extent of the connivance which existed between the djibouti prosecutor and the french judge and which wa quite simply outrageous the court note that the applicant did not confine himself in the article to factual statement about the failure to transmit the cassette and the presence of a letter from the djibouti prosecutor inside the cassette cover he had accompanied those factual observation with value judgment which cast doubt on the impartiality and fairness of judge m and alleged that there wa some connivance between the investigating judge and the djibouti prosecutor the court further note that it wa found by the tribunal de grande instance that the applicant had not disputed the defamatory nature of his comment and that he stood by the substance of his accusation which he regarded a well founded see paragraph above furthermore the applicant and a fellow lawyer had on the previous day september sent a letter to the minister of justice containing the same claim and calling for an investigation by the general inspectorate of judicial service into the numerous shortcoming that had been brought to light in the course of the judicial investigation into judge borrels death see paragraph above the court note lastly that the investigation file had already been removed from judge m by a decision of the investigation division of the paris court of appeal dated june judge m wa thus no longer handling the case when the applicant made his statement about her working method in the case in those circumstance the court find that the applicant publicly attacked in a mainstream daily newspaper the investigating judge and the functioning of the judicial system just one day after contacting the minister of justice without waiting for a response to his request even if his aim had been to alert the public with regard to possible problem in the functioning of the justice system which the court ha acknowledged to be a matter of public interest see kudeshkina v russia no february the applicant did so in particularly virulent term with the risk of influencing not only the minister of justice but also the investigation division which wa examining his complaint in the scientology case see paragraph above it go without saying that freedom of expression is not denied to lawyer who are certainly entitled to comment in public on the administration of justice but their criticism must not overstep certain bound see schöpfer cited above having regard to the key role played by lawyer in this area it is legitimate to expect them to contribute to the smooth functioning of the justice system and thus to the maintaining of public confidence in that system ibid the court reiterates that the press is one of the mean by which politician and public opinion can verify that judge are discharging their heavy responsibility in a manner that is in conformity with the aim which is the basis of the task entrusted to them see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no and july and sarl libération cited above the primary task of lawyer is to defend their client and they have available to them judicial remedy by which to seek redress for possible shortcoming in the justice system in the present case the applicant had already used such remedy and had thus far been successful having regard to the foregoing the court find that in expressing himself a he did the applicant behaved in a manner which overstepped the limit that lawyer have to observe in publicly criticising the justice system this conclusion is reinforced by the seriousness of the accusation made in the article and in particular those alleging that the judge conduct wa completely at odds with the principle of impartiality and fairness and that there had been some connivance between her and the djibouti prosecutor the court take the view that in the circumstance of the case the domestic court were justified in finding that the comment in question made by a lawyer were serious and insulting visàvis judge m that they were capable of undermining public confidence in the judicial system unnecessarily given that the judicial investigation in the case had been assigned to another judge several month previously and that there were sufficient ground to find the applicant guilty contrast foglia v switzerland no december moreover having regard to the chronology of the event it could be inferred from the applicant comment a the court of appeal noted that they were driven by some personal animosity towards judge m see paragraph above the court reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are factor to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see cumpănă and mazăre v romania gc no echr xi and brunet lecomte and others v france no february a regard the proportionality of the sanction the court note that the applicant wa found guilty of an offence and ordered to pay a fine however in view of the margin of appreciation left to contracting state by article of the convention a criminal measure a a response to defamation can not a such be considered disproportionate to the aim pursued see radio france and others v france no echr ii secondly the amount of the fine imposed on the applicant euro doe not appear excessive the same is true of the euro in damage that he wa ordered to pay to the civil party jointly with his two codefendant in those circumstance and having regard to the content of the impugned comment the court considers that the measure imposed on the applicant were not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued in the light of the foregoing the court find that the authority did not overstep their margin of appreciation in sentencing the applicant accordingly there ha been no violation of article of the convention iii application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court find that there ha been a violation of the convention or the protocol thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party a damage the applicant claimed euro eur in respect of the pecuniary damage that he alleged to have sustained he included therein the fine and the damage that he had been ordered to pay together with the court cost that he had had to reimburse to the civil party in respect of nonpecuniary damage he requested eur the government observed that the applicant had only furnished proof of payment for the sum of eur in may and that it wa jointly with the newspaper publication director and the journalist that he had been ordered to pay damage and court cost to the civil party a to nonpecuniary damage the government argued that the finding of a violation would be sufficient the court doe not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged it therefore reject this claim however it find it appropriate to award the applicant eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage b cost and expense the applicant also claimed eur for the cost and expense incurred before the court he produced invoice from two lawyer and copy of the cheque used to pay those sum the government observed that the invoice thus furnished had not contained any detail a to the nature of the service rendered and did not enable a connection to be established with the present case they argued that in any event the sum should be reduced to fairer proportion proposing eur according to the court caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of cost and expense only in so far a it ha been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable a to quantum in the present case regard being had to the document in it possession and the above criterion the court considers it reasonable to award the applicant the sum of eur for the proceeding before it c default interest the court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the european central bank to which should be added three percentage point for these reason the court declares unanimously the application admissible hold unanimously that there ha been a violation of article of the convention hold by six vote to one that there ha been no violation of article of the convention

for just satisfaction done in french and notified in writing on july pursuant to rule and of the rule of court claudia westerdiek mark villiger registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the separate opinion of judge yudkivska and lemmens are annexed to this judgment mvcwpartly dissenting opinion of judge yudkivskathe present case concern the balance between a lawyer freedom of speech and the need to uphold the authority of the judiciary the importance of such balance can not be overestimated assessing the competing interest in this case i am unable to share the opinion of my colleague who have found the interference with the applicant freedom of expression to be proportionate in my opinion the majority in the chamber did not take full account of a certain number of important fact the first issue is that of the specific role of lawyer in addition to the need to uphold the authority of the judiciary lawyer have an obligation to defend their client interest zealously the applicant wa furious to learn that the judge had not deemed it necessary to register and transmit to her successor an item of evidence that he regarded a important he referred the matter to the minister of justice and gave an interview to a newspaper the majority in the chamber shared the opinion of the domestic judicial authority namely that the expression used by the applicant reflected his animosity and that there had been no reason to criticise the judge so harshly especially a the case had already been withdrawn from her responsibility for drawing attention to the shortcoming of judicial investigation and proceeding in the interest of the court themselves lie precisely with the lawyer there is no doubt that the expression used by a lawyer must be acceptable without seeking to humiliate or offend those involved in judicial proceeding including the judge a the aim of such comment by a lawyer is not to offend but to shed light on any shortcoming an aim that in my opinion wa pursued in the present case it is then very difficult for me to find sufficient ground on which to limit such expression the comment made by the lawyer were not directed at the judge in person but were critical of her conduct during the proceeding in question thus the applicant remark to the effect that she had displayed conduct which wa completely at odds with the principle of impartiality and fairness and that there had been some connivance between her and the public prosecutor of djibouti a recognised by the majority were value judgment based on an undeniable fact the failure to transmit the cassette and the presence of a letter from the djibouti prosecutor inside it cover see paragraph of the judgment accordingly the comment in question even though they contain a certain degree of exaggeration should not be regarded a an unwarranted personal attack but rather a an interpretation of a matter of great public importance the interview with the applicant wa part of the public debate concerning this highprofile case the matter of public interest the proper administration of justice concerned him above all in his capacity a lawyer for the victim who a indicated in the mor v france case had a clear interest both for their defence and for the dispassionate and independent judicial investigation in respect of their complaint and giving an interview to the press wa a legitimate part of their defence given that the case had aroused interest in the medium and among the general public for that reason i am unable to accept the majority argument to the effect that the applicant criticism wa exaggerated because judge m wa no longer handling the case when the applicant made his statement about her working method in the case paragraph the applicant criticism precisely concerned judge m conduct after the transmission of the case to another judge and in particular the fact that part of the evidence had not been passed on according to the applicant that omission could have undermined the ongoing judicial investigation and he considered it necessary to alert the minister of justice and public opinion the majority also found fault with the applicant for having given the impugned interview just one day after contacting the minister of justice without waiting for a response to his request see paragraph however the referral of the matter to the minister of justice and the interview in the newspaper clearly had different aim the aim of the first wa to trigger disciplinary proceeding against the judge that being a procedural remedy available to a lawyer in respect of shortcoming on the part of the judiciary the aim of the second action wa to draw the attention of the general public to failing in the judicial investigation concerning this wellknown case i do not believe that one can find fault with a lawyer who ha procedural remedy by which to make good any shortcoming in judicial proceeding whether he us them a in the present case or not for having prompted a public debate a those two path lead in different direction in addition any disciplinary sanction imposed on a judge will not necessarily be known to the public even though clear failing could be seen in the judge work in the present case in any event a lawyer mission is in the very interest of the judicial system to use his best endeavour to ensure that the judicial investigation is conducted objectively and impartially a the court pointed out in kyprianou for the public to have confidence in the administration of justice they must have confidence in the ability of the legal profession to provide effective representation the principle of fair justice encompasses the right to be assisted by an independent lawyer who discharge his professional duty without excessive restriction or interference the possibility of freely expressing his opinion is an indispensable condition for a lawyer to be able to fulfil his principal professional duty the defence of his client interest indeed the lawyer speech argument and persuasion whether oral or written is his main resource a my honourable colleague judge casadevall ha written on this subject speech the sole weapon together with the pen or the keyboard and a very simple but nevertheless formidable one at the lawyer disposal when he is defending a party to proceeding the possibility of filing a complaint with a disciplinary body is not really an appropriate mean of expression when it come to a lawyer freedom of speech moreover public debate a to a problem arising in judicial proceeding is necessary in a democratic society it is clear that any criticism by a lawyer must be assessed in a very stringent manner for the public ha more confidence in the comment of a lawyer who ha inside knowledge of the case than for example those of journalist reporting on a trial in the medium but it would not be rational to leave the possibility of criticism only to outside observer for a wall of silence imposed on professional in relation to a trial that is important for public opinion would discredit the court in the public eye more than the criticism emanating from those professional it is precisely the lawyer who appear in the case before the court and who have the requisite qualification to see the fault and defect in the proceeding that the public count upon to receive information to turn court proceeding into a closed forum where one should not air one dirty washing would in my opinion affect the image of the judicial system more than explicit criticism provided of course that it doe not become offensive or purely speculative with that in mind i do not think that the expression used by the applicant can be regarded a unfounded attack lastly the lawyer conviction for making value judgment appears disproportionate the very existence of criminal proceeding ha a chilling effect lawyer defending their client right should not have to fear prosecution on that account having regard to the foregoing i have reached the conclusion that in the present case the applicant right under article of the convention were not duly upheld partly dissenting opinion of judge lemmensi voted with the majority in finding a violation of article of the convention and no violation of article however i disagreed with my colleague a regard the application of article of the convention in the present case the only violation found by the court concerned the composition of the bench of the criminal division of the court of cassation which dismissed the applicant appeal on point of law the violation related more specifically to only one of the ten judge on the bench the court did not take the view that the court of cassations decision wa open to criticism in term of it content having regard to the convention on the contrary it dismissed the article complaint in those circumstance i am of the view that the finding of a violation of article of the convention would in itself have constituted sufficient redress for the nonpecuniary damage sustained by the applicant nikula v finland no echr ii see mutatis mutandis kudeshkina v

stuttgart area germany in one match which had ended with the result of against casino sw bregenz the goalkeeper at had made serious mistake a expected and another player ai had been replaced because of his poor performance dg had also been playing in that match the reason for the manipulation wa the player financial difficulty they had not received their salary for month they had all signed a public statement prepared by the management of the club denying their involvement in the betting scandal on the following page there wa an article under the headline a result shock a second time ein schockt ein zweites mal in which a football match of november wa reviewed again and it wa hinted that the poor performance of some of the player wa connected to the bettingscandal c the criminal proceeding on march at dg and ai filed a private prosecution privatanklage against the applicant before the feldkirch regional court they argued that the accusation raised in the article published by the applicant company in it newspaper on february that they had accepted bribe and manipulated football match wa particularly serious for a professional football player and his professional reputation this accusation which wa untrue constituted defamation and they requested the court to convict the first and second applicant of this offence they indicated in particular the following passage of the article a defamatoryi terrible suspicion against footballpros confirmed bregenz player bribed with eur schlimmer vedacht gegen fussball profis erhärtet bregenz spieler mit bestochenii sold and

damit ihr team drei spiele verliertiv regarding the third plaintiff at at had made contact with the croatian bettingmafia den kontakt zur kroatischen wettmafia soll at hergestellt haben they also claimed compensation from the applicant company for the harm caused and requested that the judgment be published in it newspaper on march the feldkirch regional court ordered the applicant company to publish within five day a short piece kurze mitteilung on the institution of criminal proceeding for defamation in respect of the article at issue on april the applicant commented on the charge against them they argued that they had only voiced a suspicion against the plaintiff but that in any event their statement were true or at least the first and second applicant had had good reason to believe that they were true which would rule out punishment between april and december the regional court held four hearing in the case in which it heard several witness inter alia ke a freelance journalist working for the third applicant newspaper and who had contacted two informant who had wished to remain anonymous and rh see above rh spoke about his contact with the s brother since may and stated that one of them f had contact in austria in particular the football club casino sw bregenz in his opinion two player of that team were in contact with f but he did not give any name or other detail on december the regional court found that the incriminated statement from the article of february amounted to defamation convicted the first and second applicant of that offence and sentenced them to a fine of eur and eur respectively suspended on probation for a probationary period of three year it ordered the applicant company to pay compensation of eur to each plaintiff and to publish an extract of the present judgment in it newspaper a regard the impugned article the regional court paid particular attention to it visual appearance which through it layout and presentation in particular the printing in white in a large black box conveyed to the reader the impression that the investigator were about to catch the pictured person who had filled their pocket with money by using dirty trick that first impression wa not mitigated by the small reference to a suspicion in the upper left corner the same wa true for the headline on page which read sold and betrayed the team for eur this wa a leading question which already contained the answer and again that first impression could hardly be mitigated by the use of the subjunctive in some phrase of the article itself the court therefore concluded that seen a a whole the article created the impression of being a statement of fact about the scandal and not a genuine expression of a suspicion the regional court therefore examined whether the accused had acted with due journalistic diligence when they considered these statement a true or if they could prove their veracity a regard the first element the regional court accepted that there wa a public interest in being informed on the question of whether or not player of the casino sw bregenz team had actually been involved in a betting scandal but found that the first and second applicant had not acted with sufficient professional diligence they had not personally conducted any research to verify the wellfoundedness of the rumour but had merely relied on the research of ke a freelance collaborator with the newspaper and had not checked the reliability of the source anonymous informant not known to them furthermore they had not given at dg and ai an opportunity to react even though there had been important new element going beyond a general suspicion of involvement in the betting scandal to which they had already reacted in the past namely that they had received a specific amount eur for manipulating three football match in the summer of turning to the proof of truth put forward by the applicant the regional court observed that dg and ai had only been accused by kes two informant x and y of being involved in the betting scandal and these informant had not given any detail nor stated that they themselves had witnessed a transaction also rh when heard by the court did not refer to them directly or indirectly there wa clearly no proof of the truth a regard at the regional court observed that he had lied when he stated that he did not know f that f had repeatedly visited bregenz and that there had been football match in which that player had given a very poor performance also the informant x and y had stated that at wa involved in the betting scandal these were argument speaking in favour of his involvement in the betting scandal but there were also argument speaking against it wa understandable that at had not admitted to knowing f immediately when all kind of suspicion were discussed in connection with the betting scandal a f wa one of the principal person involved in that scandal furthermore there wa only evidence that f had visited bregenz on various occasion between autumn and may whereas the football match which in the eye of the author of the article wa particularly suspicious had taken place in november according to the information given by x and y f had paid the three accused football player eur in summer for three match which had not yet taken place that did not coincide with his habit a described in detail by rh lastly the amount claimed by x and y namely eur wa not plausible given that casino sw bregenz had been at the very end of the national football league table in austria throughout the season of and the quota for bet on that team losing a match would have been so small that it would not have justified the investment of a considerable sum weighing all these element the regional court concluded that the applicant had not succeeded in proving the truth of the statement made in the impugned article a regard the compensation under section of the medium act the regional court found that the particular seriousness of the accusation raised and the adverse effect they could have on the career of a professional footballer justified the sum of compensation granted on january the applicant appealed against this judgment they argued that the impugned article did not contain a statement of fact but merely a suspicion against at dg and ai moreover the first and second applicant had fully complied with journalistic ethic a ke and the applicant had acted a a team there wa no need to check further the information received and at that stage of the investigation there had also been no need to give the plaintiff an opportunity to react to the information to be published on april the innsbruck court of appeal dismissed the appeal of the first and second applicant but partially granted the appeal of the applicant company and reduced the amount of compensation to eur for each plaintiff it found that the regional court had carefully weighed the argument and had arrived at a correct and wellreasoned judgment it agreed with the regional court that the first and second applicant had not reported on a mere suspicion but had presented their allegation a fact which they had failed to prove ii relevant domestic law if a publication in the medium viewed objectively constitutes defamation under section of the criminal code or an insult under section of the criminal code the insulted person may claim nonpecuniary damage against the medium owner pursuant to section of the medium act section of the criminal code in so far a relevant read a follows a it may be perceived by a third party anyone who make an accusation against another of having a contemptible character or attitude or of behaving contrary to honour or morality and of such a nature a to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six month or a fine anyone who commits this offence in a printed document by broadcasting or otherwise in such a way a to make the defamation accessible to a broad section of the public shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine the person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true a regard the offence defined in paragraph he shall also not be liable if circumstance are established which gave him sufficient reason to assume that the statement wa true section of the medium act in force at the time of the event read a follows if in a medium the presence of the factual element of the offence of defamation is established the person concerned ha against the owner of the medium a claim for compensation of the prejudice suffered the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that their conviction for defamation and the order to pay compensation violated their right to freedom of expression they relied on article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the court note that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the court note that it is common ground between the party that the feldkirch regional court judgment of october upheld by the court of appeal which convicted the first and second applicant of defamation and ordered the applicant company to pay damage constituted an interference with the their right to freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the convention an interference contravenes article of the convention unless it is prescribed by law pursues one or more of the legitimate aim referred to in paragraph and is necessary in a democratic society for achieving such an aim or aim the court considers and this wa acknowledged by the party that the interference wa prescribed by law namely by article of the criminal code and section of the medium act the court further find and this wa likewise not disputed between the party that the interference served a legitimate aim namely the protection of the reputation or right of others within the meaning of article of the convention the party argument concentrated on the question of whether the interference had been necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention the party submission the applicant submitted that the subject matter of the article published in the applicant company newspaper concerned issue of particular public interest namely fraud connected with manipulated football game in order to report correctly on this issue the applicant had also to reveal the identity of the private plaintiff in the defamation proceeding who were public figure because at the time of the event at dg and ai were football player for an austrian football club in the first league therefore the public had a right to be informed of these event they further submitted that the article of february merely reported on a suspicion that at dg and ai had manipulated football match accordingly the headline on the first page stated terrible suspicion against football player confirmed and under the picture it wa stated that the investigator are at the heel of this trio they may have manipulated match for the betting mafia in the article on page of the issue the headline raised the question of whether the team had been betrayed and sold for eur the subheadline stated that there wa new evidence in the betting scandal this article also included the statement made by at dg and ai that they had nothing to do with the bet rigging in the applicant view all requirement of journalistic diligence had in every way been fulfilled it wa a fact that the police had investigated the betting scandal and ke a freelance journalist working for the applicant company newspaper had obtained information from two informant whom he considered trustworthy and this information corresponded to the result of the police investigation the applicant therefore reported correctly on an existing suspicion against at dg and ai and the conviction of the first and second applicant for defamation and the order to pay damage were in breach of article of the convention the government submitted that the article at issue concerned a matter of public interest which also extended to the identity of at dg and ai who had to be considered a public figure since they played for an austrian football club in the first league at the time a regard the content of the article or article published the regional court carefully examined the meaning of the incriminated passage of the text in the context of the article a a whole and arrived at the conclusion that the text did not limit itself to voicing the suspicion that dg ai and at had manipulated football match but presented these accusation a fact the government pointed out that at the trial the applicant had claimed that their statement were essentially true and that in any event they had acted with the required journalistic diligence and therefore had good reason to believe that their statement were true however the regional court found that the applicant had failed to prove the truth because they had not acted with sufficient journalistic diligence in particular they had not given dg ai and at a fair opportunity to comment on the charge raised because they had failed to confront them with the most relevant charge namely that they had received the sum of eur for manipulating one particular match of the casino sw bregenz football club this wa not an irrelevant detail but a highlighted by the headline on the front page and in the article itself wa a central element moreover the sanction imposed on the applicant wa not disproportionate the first and second applicant were sentenced to a moderate fine suspended on probation and the applicant company wa ordered to make compensation payment under article of the medium act in an amount which could not be considered excessive the court assessmenta general principle according to the court wellestablished caselaw the test of necessity in a democratic society requires the court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a pressing social need whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason given by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient see the sunday time v the united kingdom no april series a no in assessing whether such a need exists and what measure should be adopted to deal with it the national authority are left a certain margin of appreciation this power of appreciation is not however unlimited but go hand in hand with a european supervision by the court whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article see bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction the court can not confine itself to considering the impugned court decision in isolation it must look at them in the light of the case a a whole including the material for which reproach is made against the applicant company and the context in which they were published krone verlag gmb h co kg v austria no february with further reference an important factor for the court determination is the essential function of the press in a democratic society although the press must not overstep certain bound in particular in respect of the reputation and right of others or the proper administration of justice it duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with it obligation and responsibility information and idea on all matter of public interest see bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above and a a recent authority flinkkilä and others v finland no april by reason of the duty and responsibility inherent in the exercise of freedom of expression the safeguard afforded by article to journalist in relation to reporting on issue of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and providing reliable and precise information in accordance with the ethic of journalism see fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i and a a recent authority eerikäinen and others v finland no february whilst it is true that the method of objective and balanced reporting may vary considerably and that it is therefore not for this court nor for the national court to substitute their own view for those of the press a to what technique of reporting should be adopted jersild v denmark september series a no editorial discretion is not unbounded not only doe the press have the task of imparting such information and idea the public also ha a right to receive them were it otherwise the press would be unable to play it vital role of public watchdog observer and guardian v the united kingdom november series a no thorgeir thorgeirson v iceland june series a no bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above gutiérrez suárez v spain no june in this respect the court reiterates that article doe not guarantee wholly unrestricted freedom of expression to the press even with respect to coverage of matter of serious public concern while enjoying the protection afforded by the convention journalist must when exercising their duty abide by the principle of responsible journalism namely to act in good faith provide accurate and reliable information objectively reflect the opinion of those involved in a public debate and refrain from pure sensationalism see novaya gazeta and borodyanskiy v russia no march with further reference and mutatis mutandis bargão and domingo correia v portugal no and november the subject matter at issue in this case relates on the one hand to the right of the press under article of the convention to inform the public on matter of public interest and concern and on the other to the state positive obligation under article of the convention to protect the reputation of person to whom such proceeding relate when verifying whether the authority struck a fair balance between two protected value guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in this type of case freedom of expression protected by article and the right to respect for private life enshrined in article the court must balance the public interest in the publication of the information and the need to protect a person reputation see axel springer ag v germany gc no february and pfeifer v austria no november the balancing of individual interest which may well be contradictory is a difficult matter and contracting state must have a margin of appreciation in this respect since the national authority are in principle better placed than this court to ass whether or not there is a pressing social need capable of justifying an interference with one of the right guaranteed by the convention see mgn limited cited above and egeland and hanseid v norway cited above in case such a the present one which require the right to respect for private life to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression the court considers that the outcome of the application should not in theory vary according to whether it ha been lodged with the court under article of the convention by the person who wa the subject of the article or under article by the publisher indeed a a matter of principle these right deserve equal respect accordingly the margin of appreciation should in theory be the same in both case von hannover v germany no gc no and echr b application of these principle to the present case in the present case the applicant company newspaper neue vorarlberger tageszeitung published on february an article written by the first and second applicant in that article three professional football player of the casino sw bregenz football team at dg and ai were accused of having accepted a bribe of eur for manipulating three football match the three player instituted proceeding for defamation against the first and second applicant and for compensation against the applicant company on december the regional court convicted the first and second applicant of defamation and imposed fine in the amount of eur and eur respectively and ordered the applicant company to pay compensation in the amount of eur to the plaintiff upon appeal the court of appeal maintained the conviction of the first and second applicant and reduced the amount of compensation to eur for each plaintiff like the party the court considers that the article concerned a subject matter which wa of considerable public interest namely manipulation of sport game and fraud connected thereto and the interest of the general public to be informed on such event did not only extend to the football club engaged in competition but also extended to the individual player who were known to the reader of sport page a regard the content of the impugned article the court observes that the applicant did not discus in a general manner a matter of public concern but rather directly attacked three football player from the casino sw bregenz football club and accused them of having accepted money in exchange for manipulating football match the regional court carefully examined the character of the article and besides the wording also took into account it context layout and presentation in particular it found that the manner in which the text wa printed drawing the reader attention to the accusation raised and the use of photograph and leading question created an overall impression of being a statement of fact about the scandal and not a genuine expression of a suspicion in this respect the court considers that accusation of manipulating football match can seriously damage the personal and professional reputation of football player and may have important financial repercussion for them and the football club concerned a they touch upon the central ethical conception of sport while the applicant claimed before the court that they had merely expressed a suspicion and that they had had sufficient factual basis for their suspicion before the regional court they had claimed that their statement were true and offered to prove the truth of their allegation these accusation were extremely serious and given that the accusation were concrete detailed and addressed to person named in the article the court considers that they should have had a solid factual basis a regard the proof of truth offered by the applicant the court observes that the regional court in it judgment exhaustively assessed the evidence submitted by the applicant and concluded that the truth of the allegation wa not supported by this evidence from the material before it also the court doe not consider that the applicant could have relied on such a solid factual basis a required by austrian law the regional court also examined whether the applicant could rely on the further line of defence under section of the criminal code namely that they had acted with necessary journalistic diligence the court doe not consider that the domestic court set unreasonable requirement for proving the truth of the applicant allegation nor overstretched the requirement of journalistic diligence given that the applicant reported on the matter giving particular detail which for example concerned the amount of the bribe the number of football match manipulated extensively featuring one particular match and drew reader attention to these detail the court doe not find it unreasonable that the austrian court considered one statutory declaration signed by the player of the football club and drawn up by the managment of the club a insufficient to give at dg and ai a reasonable opportunity to comment on the charge prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no lastly the court considers that the interference with the

31,the applicant are journalist at the relevant time they were employed by one of the two national television station in denmark danmark radio hereafter dr the first applicant produced a television programme described a a documentary called when the doctor know best which wa broadcast at pm on september and seen by viewer the second applicant wa the first applicant superior and responsible for the content of the programme the television programme concerned the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer notably at copenhagen university hospital rigshospitalet where consultant s wa in charge of treatment it focused on two type of chemotherapy medication alimta produced by l and vinorelbine produced by f copenhagen university hospital and s used vinorelbine a firstline treatment in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin depending on whether the treatment wa related to an operation operable patient or to prolonging life and relieving pain and symptom inoperable patient three expert participated in the programme a medical doctor from karolinska hospital in sweden a professor from switzerland and a medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany they all used alimta a firstline treatment most often in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin the programme followed four patient and their relative who told their story and a narrator spoke a a voiceover throughout the programme in preparation for the programme the first applicant had carried out research on the subject which included inter alia the following on september the european union had approved the marketing of alimta in combination with cisplatin for treatment of patient with inoperable pleural mesothelioma cancer the background for the approval wa among others research which had been carried out examining the effect of treatment with alimta in combination with cisplatin a compared to treatment with cisplatin alone a phase iii trial see paragraph below a firstline therapy in july the minister for internal affair and health replied to various question posed by member of parliament a to the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer in denmark the minister replied inter alia that there wa no proof that an alimtabased treatment wa more efficient than other chemotherapybased treatment including that offered in denmark that the combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin which wa used at copenhagen university hospital resulted in a oneyear survival rate of and a median lifetime of month which wa exactly the survival rate from using the combination of alimta and cisplatin but that there had been no direct comparison of the two treatment and that there wa no internationally accepted standard chemotherapy for the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer but that several single and combined treatment were used on june copenhagen university hospital produced a memorandum about pleural mesothelioma cancer and it treatment which wa sent to dr it stressed that international study including of vinorelbine and alimta had not shown that any twocombination regime wa superior to other twocombination regime that information wa confirmed by the professor from switzerland in an email of june and by the medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany in an email of june the memorandum also referred to a fund aimed at developing research on pleural mesothelioma cancer in the amount of danish krone dkk equal to approximately euro eur received by s from company f which produce vinorelbine the money had been used to pay nurse and student and for data collection it emerged that there had been no financial profit for the doctor involved having received the abovementioned memorandum the first applicant again contacted the professor from switzerland and the medical doctor at grosshandorf hospital in germany in essence they confirmed in subsequent email of and july that since there had been no direct comparative clinical study there wa no scientific evidence that one twocombination regime wa superior to another twocombination regime medical research study involving human subject are called clinical trial they are divided into different stage called phase generally it can be said that the earliest phase trial may look at whether a drug is safe or at it sideeffects a later phase ii trial aim to find out whether the treatment work well enough for which type of cancer the treatment work more about side effect and how to manage them and more about the best dose to use a later phase iii trial aim to test whether a new treatment is better than existing treatment standard treatment these trial may compare a completely new treatment with the standard treatment or with different dos or way of giving a standard treatment a the proceeding before the court subsequent to the broadcast on september of the television programme on october copenhagen university hospital and s instituted defamation proceeding before the copenhagen city court københavns byret against the director of dr and the two applicant maintaining that the latter in the programme in question had made direct and indirect accusation covered by article of the penal code straffeloven against copenhagen university hospital and s of malpractice regarding certain patient suffering from pleural mesothelioma cancer allegedly resulting in the patient unnecessary death and shortening of life in the interest of s professional prestige and private finance before the city court the applicant s and medical director h for copenhagen university hospital gave evidence the first applicant stated inter alia that she had not criticised copenhagen university hospital for improper treatment causing death her message wa only to point out that the substance of alimta had been better documented than the substance of vinorelbine she had collected statement from patient and expert but could not state herself whether alimta wa a better product than vinorelbine the expert had not stated whether alimta in combination with another product wa better than vinorelbine in combination with another product however all expert had emphasised that alimta had been evaluated in a phase iii trial for which reason it wa a more thoroughly tested product her question had been answered during her conversation with professor m on october and s on october subsequently no one had been willing to answer her question that wa the only real conversation she had had with s the next time she had called him he had put down the receiver when it had not been possible for her to get any response to her many point of criticism she had contacted h she had wanted statement from both h and s a the programme would be unbalanced if they were not heard some found that alimta had been better documented than vinorelbine she wa not aware of any trial demonstrating that a combination with alimta wa better than a combination with another medicinal product s stated inter alia the following alimta ha been used for secondline therapy in denmark since and since a firstline therapy patient had been given the impression in the medium that alimta wa a miracle cure therefore copenhagen university hospital had introduced it a an option today alimta is used in combination with carboplatin a the standard therapy for inoperable patient sometimes in autumn the standard therapy for operable patient had been changed to cisplatin in combination with alimta if some patient were offered alimta everybody had to be offered alimta after the programme had been broadcast patient started mistrusting the vinorelbine therapy afterwards it wa not possible to perform the trial phase ii on this drug nor would it be possible to obtain funding for the trial therefore no trial had been performed of vinorelbine he had provided the information included in professor m memorandum of september he had talked to the first applicant several time and had spent a lot of time and energy on explaining cancer therapy he had also lost confidence in the first applicant h stated among other thing the approval of alimta by the danish medicine agency for the treatment of mesothelioma only mean that a marketing authorisation ha been granted for the drug which mean that advertisement of the product is permitted vinorelbine ha also been approved by the danish medicine agency but for a wide range of oncological therapy in when alimta wa tested phase iii the bar had been set quite low the study compared alimta with a clearly inferior treatment that would not actually be offered to anybody it would have been more relevant to study alimta in combination with cisplatin versus vinorelbine with cisplatin s ha made a phase ii trial of the standard therapy vinorelbine subsequently the standard therapy regimen ha been expanded to include alimta which is not a better product than vinorelbine but eight time more expensive if two drug are equally effective but one of them is eight time more expensive than the other patient will be offered therapy using the cheaper drug the standard therapy now offered by copenhagen university hospital are vinorelbine in combination with cisplatin for inoperable patient and alimta in combination with cisplatin for operable patient the shift to alimta a the standard therapy at copenhagen university hospital did not reflect that alimta wa medically better the applicant programme had had a large impact a patient were asking not to be treated with vinorelbine copenhagen university hospital had therefore had to change medical product because patient had the clear impression that vinorelbine wa not a good a alimta it is quite usual for copenhagen university hospital to surrender material to the press and to answer question but the question of the first applicant were neverending copenhagen university hospital ha spent about a manyear or about dkk responding to inquiry from the first applicant and huge effort had been made to accommodate her request the programme had created distrust towards both copenhagen university hospital and s and had created uncertainty in both patient and relative he had received to hate mail himself by a judgment of april the copenhagen city court found against the applicant and the director of dr and sentenced them each to dayfines of danish krone dkk the allegation were declared null and void the reasoning wa a follows based on the evidence the city court accepts a a fact that in following a phase iii trial emea approved alimta in combination with cisplatin for treating patient suffering from inoperable malignant pleural mesothelioma and that subsequently the same wa approved by the danish medicine agency the court also accept a a fact that vinorelbine is a drug dating back more than year whose effect had been documented by clinical experience and approved by the danish medicine agency for a wide range of oncological therapy finally the court also accepts a a fact that it ha not been documented that alimta therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product is more effective than vinorelbine therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product a regard the term experimental drug the court accepts a a fact that a drug administered to patient in a trial is referred to a an experimental drug no matter whether the same drug is the standard therapy offered outside the trial setting no matter that the applicant are deemed to have been aware of the above circumstance following their comprehensive research of the matter it wa said in the programme that for dying patient s and copenhagen university hospital had prescribed a nonapproved chemotherapy regimen not approved for the diagnosis or which wa not the correct chemotherapy and that s and copenhagen university hospital used an experimental drug the worstcase scenario being that patient would die earlier than if they had been treated with an approved substance or that it would have fatal consequence moreover the phrase the only drug with a known effect wa used since no account wa given in the programme of the abovementioned trial and approval process and the terminology applied for that process the court find that it would seem to a nonprofessional viewer that alimta wa the only effective drug for mesothelioma particularly because the programme linked the treatment of two patient with vinorelbine to their death whereas the prospect of several more year to live wa held out to the one patient who had been given alimta therapy in germany moreover the programme also linked s use of vinorelbine to his personal esteem and his personal research account although the applicant had been made aware of the research grant management procedure though professor m memorandum of september before the broadcast since no account wa given either of the procedure for managing research grant the court also find in this respect that it would seem to a nonprofessional viewer that s had a personal financial interest in starting vinorelbine treatment rather than alimta the applicant are therefore considered to have violated article of the penal code according to the information on the applicant knowledge after their comprehensive research of the matter the court find no basis for exempting them from punishment or remitting the penalty under article of the penal code compare also article of the convention the applicant are furthermore jointly and severally liable for paying legal cost of dkk on appeal on june the judgment wa upheld by the high court of eastern denmark østre landsret with the following reasoning in the introduction to the programme when the doctor know best a narrator state among other thing a danish doctor is entering a medical congress to show his research result for year he ha gone his own way he ha treated dying patient with chemotherapy that is not approved later during the programme it is stated at which hospital one can receive treatment for pleural mesothelioma cancer that these hospital cooperate with copenhagen university hospital and a reference is made to a named consultant s head of the scandinavian centre for treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer during the various interview a narrator state inter alia the doctor doe not give his patient the only approved medication instead he us a test medication in the worst scenario that may result in the patient dying earlier than if they had been given the approved substance there is only one approved chemotherapy against pleural mesothelioma cancer but that is not offered to sp one of the patient followed in the programme the doctor chose to treat her with a substance that is not approved for the diagnosis and whose effect on pleural mesothelioma cancer is not substantiated however that chemotherapy turned out to have huge consequence for her sp s can freely choose the medication that he think is best there is only one treatment which in comparative study ha proved to have an effect on pleural mesothelioma cancer accordingly that is the only medication which is approved a treatment that medication is called alimta however s chose not to use that medication on his patient thus it ha not been proved whether vinorelbine work according to the calculation made by dr close to patient in denmark have been given test medication in the worst scenario that may result in patient dying earlier than if they had been given the approved medication for her sp the lack of effect of treatment by vinorelbine turn out to have had fatal consequence the family k ask themselves why s go his own way they suspect that he ha other interest than those of the patient that suspicion grows when they talk to sks personal doctor it turn out however that s may also have had other reason for choosing vinorelbine because he ha used this medication in medical test on the patient in a phase when they are fighting for their life the question remains why doe s carry out test with vinorelbine could it have something to do with the prestige which is implicit in having research article published we do not know whether it is prestige that impels s thus s will not acknowledge what leading expert agree on namely that alimta is the only medication whose effect is substantiated here it turn out that s ha received more than dkk over the last five and a half year from the company f that is the company behind the test medication vinorelbine the money ha been paid into s personal research account dkk is earmarked for the test s withheld that information the programme end by informing u among other thing that two of the patient who were interviewed have passed away the narrator say inter alia tj who wa part of s test with vinorelbine died on january with these statement the applicant not only passed on assertion by patient relative and expert but also took a stand so that the programme undisputedly gave the viewer the impression that malpractice ha occurred at copenhagen university hospital in that s ha deliberately used medication vinorelbine which is not approved for treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer and whose effect ha not been substantiated that the medication in question wa part of a test and that the test medication ha resulted in patient dying or having their life shortened the way that the programme is built up with it beginning and ending the viewer get the clear impression that the reason behind this choice of medication vinorelbine were s professional prestige and personal finance against this background in the programme the applicant a producer of the programme and a chief subeditor have made an allegation against copenhagen university hospital and s of malpractice and of nourishing irrelevant consideration to the detriment of the life and health of patient such an accusation is likely to disparage copenhagen university hospital and s in the eye of their fellow citizen a set out in article of the penal code it must have been clear to them the applicant that they were making such an allegation by way of their presentation of the programme the applicant have not attempted to establish the truth of the allegation but have submitted that the allegation shall be unpunishable by virtue of article of the penal code a they acted in lawful protection of an obvious public interest or the interest of others or in the alternative that punishment should be remitted under article of the penal code because they were justified in regarding the allegation a true these provision must in connection with article of the penal code be understood in the light of article of the convention on the protection of freedom of expression a very considerable public interest is related to journalistic discussion about risk to life and health or suspicion thereof a regard public hospital treatment when balancing consideration of freedom of expression with consideration of the protection of the name and reputation of person and company the former is accorded tremendous weight on the scale that entail acknowledgement of a very farreaching freedom of expression for the press and accordingly the press must be permitted a the public control and information organ public watchdog a certain amount of exaggeration and provocation in connection with their discussion of these question when factually there are reason for expressing criticism on the basis of the information in the case including the research material that the applicant possessed before the broadcast of the programme in particular the email from the medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany and the professor from switzerland the reply by the minister for internal affair and health to various question posed by member of parliament and the memorandum of june produced by copenhagen university hospital about pleural mesothelioma cancer it can be established that vinorelbine in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin wa standard treatment at copenhagen university hospital that the european union on september approved the marketing of alimta in connection with cisplatin for treatment of inoperable patient with pleural mesothelioma cancer that there wa no substantiation or basis for believing that an alimtabased treatment wa more efficient than the treatment offered by copenhagen university hospital that some patient at copenhagen university hospital who were already about to receive vinorelbine a standard treatment were chosen and offered the same medicine a part of a test it is not known for what and that s did not make any private financial profit from these test against this background including the fact that the word approved wa not explained during the programme namely the difference between medication approved for treatment and medication approved for marketing and by consistently using the word test medication even though only one patient in the programme participated in test the applicant made allegation which were based on an incorrect factual basis of which they must have been aware via the research material the aim of the programme to make a critical assessment of the treatment of patient with pleural mesothelioma cancer offered by copenhagen university hospital and the responsible consultant is a legitimate part of the press role a public watchdog but it can not justify an allegation which is built on a factually incorrect basis and thus a wrong premise the applicant who did not limit themselves to referring to or disseminating statement by expert patient and relative did not have any basis for making such serious allegation against copenhagen university hospital and s the allegation can not be justified on the ground that copenhagen university hospital and s refused to participate in the programme against this background and since in relation to article there is no interest to protect when there is no factual basis for the accusation the allegation are not unpunishable under article nor is there any basis for remitting the punishment under article of the penal code it is an aggravating factor that the wrongful accusation were disseminated on national television during primetime and on drs homepage by mean of which the accusation had a significant spread accordingly the high court agrees with the copenhagen city court judgment that the applicant be fined under article and that the allegation be declared null and void by virtue of article the high court thus dismisses the appeal and upholds the judgment of the copenhagen city court the applicant shall be jointly and severally liable for paying legal cost of the high court appeal to copenhagen university hospital and s in the amount of dkk which constitutes the legal fee inclusive of vat in fixing the amount the high court took into account the scope and duration of the case on october the appeal permission board procesbevillingsnævnet refused the applicant request for leave to appeal to the supreme court højesteret b complaint lodged with the patient insurance association subsequent to the broadcast on september of the television programme four complaint were lodged with the patient insurance association patientforsikringen relating to the issue raised by the programme a press release published on the association website on march read a follows a of today the patient insurance association ha received four complaint relating to the treatment of mesothelioma patient with combinatorial drug other than carboplatin and alimta that treatment wa questioned by the danish broadcasting corporation dr in a documentary programme in september the patient insurance association ha received four complaint relating to the criticism raised this mean that the person claiming compensation are either patient or their dependant one of the reason being their belief that the combinatorial drug administered to treat the disease were incorrect one all four complaint have been refused one of the reason being that the independent medical oncologist who assessed the case found that it wa in compliance with optimum medical standard to treat patient with the selected combination therapy two of the case have been appealed against to the national agency for patient right and complaint patientskadeankenævnet the national agency for patient right and complaint upheld the decision of the patient insurance association finding inter alia patient were offered carboplatin and vinorelbine which must be considered to be a active a other combination with a favourable profile of adverse reaction the other appeal doe not concern the issue of combination therapy ii relevant domestic law the relevant provision of the danish penal code applicable at the time read a follows article any person who tarnish the honour of another by offensive word or conduct or by making or spreading allegation of an act likely to disparage him in the eye of his fellow citizen shall be liable to a fine or to imprisonment not exceeding four month article if an allegation ha been maliciously made or disseminated or if the author ha no reasonable ground to regard it a true he shall be guilty of defamation and the punishment mentioned in article may increase to a term not exceeding two year article an allegation shall not be punishable if it truth ha been established or if the author of the allegation ha in good faith been under an obligation to speak or ha acted in lawful protection of an obvious public interest or of the personal interest of himself or of others the punishment may be remitted where evidence is produced which justifies the ground for regarding the allegation a true article the penalty prescribed in article of the penal code may be remitted if the act ha been provoked by improper behaviour on the part of the injured person or if he is guilty of retaliation article if a defamatory allegation is unjustified a statement to that effect shall at the request of the injured party be included in the sentence any person convicted of defamation may be ordered at the request of the insulted person to pay to the insulted person an amount fixed by the court to cover the cost of promulgating the judgment conclusion alone or also the ground in one or more official gazette this also applies even if the judgment only provides for retraction under the provision of subsection the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the judgment of the high court amounted to a disproportionate interference with their right to freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the court note that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission the applicant recognised that their conviction wa prescribed by law and that in respect of s it pursued a legitimate aim they submitted however that copenhagen university hospital could not in it capacity a a public body rely on the protection of the reputation or right of others under article of the convention and referred in this respect inter alia to the dissenting opinion in romanenko and others v russia no october in the applicant opinion it would seriously harm democratic principle and legal certainty if the state were able to protect itself from public scrutiny by limiting the freedom of expression of a journalist where a public body is involved the judiciary is the only public authority whose protection is capable of constituting a legitimate aim within the meaning of article moreover they maintained that the interference constituted a breach of their right a journalist a the interference wa not necessary in a democratic society the main purpose of the programme wa to perform a critical assessment of the treatment of mesothelioma at copenhagen university hospital compared to the treatment by other leading expert and to raise question about whether patient should have been informed of other therapeutic option than vinorelbine it presented the patient and the family frustration over being denied the choice of their preferred chemotherapy especially given the fact that alimta had undergone phase iii examination and thus wa more thoroughly tested than vinorelbine the programme wa not scientific and did not claim to give a scientific account of the advantage of one cancer treatment over the other the documentary wa based on substantive and significant journalistic research carried out over a period of approximately one year it included international medical expert and a very broad range of open source material the applicant acted in good faith and in full compliance with press ethic when preparing and airing the programme both s and copenhagen university hospital were invited to comment on the allegation in the documentary on numerous occasion the memorandum of june produced by copenhagen university hospital wa not suitable for inclusion in the documentary a it did not answer the specific question asked by the applicant the subject matter that the patient and their family felt that they were not being properly informed and given the choice of which chemotherapy treatment they preferred at copenhagen university hospital wa clearly of public interest and the documentary gave rise to a broad public debate the impact wa significant and had various important consequence inter alia a public demand for alimta therapy and a change in practice at copenhagen university hospital all of which highlighted why this kind of journalism wa essential and indispensable in a democratic society the domestic court failed to carry out a careful balancing exercise between the right to impart information and protection of the reputation of others they gave a distorted picture of the content of the documentary and the responsibility of the journalist reporting what wa being said by others the applicant noted for example that the charge against them did not relate to any specific statement in the documentary and that the domestic court did not mention any specific statement by the applicant which were considered incorrect moreover the voiceovers provided in the programme should not be considered in isolation but in the context of the journalistic production a a whole with respect for the function of the documentary and of the documentary genre a a dissemination tool for statement of named third party the high court performed a crucial change of the conclusion of the documentary by finding that the programme gave a defamatory impression that alimta wa a superior product and that s had caused unnecessary death for his personal benefit this wa clearly not stated in the documentary the judicial authority placed a disproportionate and unfair burden on the applicant requiring under criminal law that they provide medical documentation about alimta compared to vinorelbine the wording of the high court judgment also indicated that there had been no specific assessment by the judge of the value of the documentary to general society finally the applicant submitted that the penalty imposed were disproportionate to the harm alleged and likely to deter journalist from performing their essential role a public watchdog and keeping the public informed about matter of public interest they pointed out that they had received criminal conviction had had to pay fine and there had been the final punishment of paying cost to s and copenhagen university hospital the government maintained that the interference wa prescribed by law and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation of others they referred to caselaw in which the court had presupposed that a public body could also fall within the protection of the reputation or right of others for example romanenko and others v russia cited above lombardo and others v malta no and april and thorgeir thorgeirson v iceland june series a no they further contended that since it wa recognised that the reputation of the police may be a legitimate aim the same should apply to several other public body the condition at a public hospital constitute an issue of considerable public interest and entail a need for wider limit for public scrutiny but this is partly for other reason than for a public body exercising power in the traditional sense public interest may therefore be deemed to be interconnected with the relevance of the activity of the hospital to the life and health of individual allegation made on a factually incorrect basis will affect the patient confidence in the treatment offered and may weaken the possibility of the hospital to function in an optimal manner in addition it would amount to unfounded arbitrariness in the protection of the health interest of the contracting state if they were to have the possibility of interfering with attack on the reputation of private hospital but not of public hospital with respect to the proportionality test the government found it of vital importance that the case at hand did not concern dissemination of defamatory statement made by others it concerned defamatory statement independently worded and made by the applicant notably when they had used the voiceover to convey the impression to the viewer that improper treatment had been given and that this wa s deliberate choice motivated by his desire for professional esteem and his personal financial situation this should lead to a stricter assessment of the applicant defamatory statement when balanced against the protection of the reputation or right of s and copenhagen university hospital the government also submitted that although the high court did not make an explicit classification of the allegation the wording of the reasoning clearly illustrated that it considered them to be allegation of fact at least those element of the allegation that did not relate to s motif referring to the high court finding the government maintained that the applicant did not act on a factually correct basis nor did they provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the ethic of journalism when making their very serious allegation they did not act in good faith among other thing they deliberately omitted to inform the viewer that according to the research material available to them the effect of vinorelbine had been documented and that there wa no basis for stating that alimtabased chemotherapy wa more effective than the vinorelbinebased treatment offered by copenhagen university hospital they also omitted to mention that copenhagen university hospital in a memorandum of june to the applicant had given a thorough account of the reason for the medical product chosen and an explanation of the research which emphasised that the doctor involved did not themselves benefit financially furthermore a stated by the high court by not defining the term approved or the difference between a drug approved for treatment and a drug approved for marketing and by consistently using the term experimental drug the applicant made accusation resting on a factually incorrect basis of which they must be deemed to have become aware through the research material in the assessment of the nature and seriousness of the defamation the government found that great importance had to be attached to the fact that audiovisual medium are very effective and that the allegation were made in a television programme by a national television company which is generally perceived a highly reliable the government fully recognised that the subject at issue wa of considerable public interest for which reason a broader protection of the freedom of expression applies the aim could have been achieved however without making the impugned accusation they also pointed out that the high court found that it had not been substantiated that there wa any medical difference between vinorelbine and alimta which wa also the conclusion of the independent medical oncologist of the patient insurance association the change of treatment regime at copenhagen university hospital caused by the programme thus illustrated that allegation made by the press on a factually incorrect basis may harm individual confidence in the national health authority finally they pointed out that the applicant had been given very mild sentence the court assessmenta whether there wa an interference prescribed by law it is common ground between the party that the impugned judgment constituted an interference by a public authority with the applicant right to freedom of expression a guaranteed under the first paragraph of article and that it wa prescribed by lawb whether it pursued a legitimate aim the applicant disputed that copenhagen university hospital being a public body could rely on the protection of the reputation or right of others under article of the convention and referred in this respect inter alia to the dissenting opinion in romanenko and others v russia cited above the court reiterates that in thorgeir thorgeirson v iceland cited above concerning charge for defamation of an unspecified member of the police it wa not disputed or questioned by the court that the applicant conviction and sentence were aimed at protecting the reputation of others and thus had a legitimate aim under article of the convention moreover in romanenko and others v russia cited above concerning a court management department being a public body the court acknowledged that there may be sound policy reason to decide that public body should not have standing to sue for defamation in their own capacity however it is not it task to examine the domestic legislation in the abstract but rather to consider the manner in which that legislation wa applied to or affected the applicant in a particular case thereafter it went on to examine the issue in the analysis of the proportionality of the interference likewise in lombardo and others v malta cited above although stating that it is only in exceptional circumstance that a measure proscribing statement criticising the act or omission of an elected body such a a council can be justified with reference to the protection of the right or reputation of others the court wa prepared to assume that this aim can be relied on and went on to the proportionality test furthermore in kharlamov v russia no october concerning a university authority the court went on to consider the issue in the analysis of the proportionality of the interference it did state though ibid that the protection of the university authority is a mere institutional interest of the university that is a consideration not necessarily of the same strength a the protection of the reputation or right of others within the meaning of article see uj v hungary no july the latter reference concerned a stateowned company in respect of which the court observed ibid the impugned criminal charge were pressed by a company which undisputedly ha a right to defend itself against defamatory allegation in this context the court accepts that in addition to the public interest in open debate about business practice there is a competing interest in protecting the commercial success and viability of company for the benefit of shareholder and employee but also for the wider economic good the state therefore enjoys a margin of appreciation a to the mean it provides under domestic law to enable a company to challenge the truth and limit the damage of allegation which risk harming it reputation see steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii kuliś and różycki v poland no echr however there is a difference between the commercial reputational interest of a company and the reputation of an individual concerning his or her social status whereas the latter might have repercussion on one dignity for the court interest of commercial reputation are devoid of that moral dimension in the instant application the reputational interest at stake is that of a stateowned corporation it is thus a commercial one without relevance to moral character having regard to the abovecited caselaw the court is not convinced by the applicant submission that the judiciary is the only public authority whose protection is capable of constituting a legitimate aim under article in the present case the high court found that the applicant a producer of the programme and a chief subeditor had made an allegation against copenhagen university hospital and s of malpractice and of nourishing irrelevant consideration to the detriment of the life and health of patient and that such an accusation wa likely to disparage copenhagen university hospital and s in the eye of their fellow citizen a set out in article of the penal code see paragraph above the court note in addition that the impugned allegation were strongly linked to s and his alleged motif for using the product vinorelbine on his patient suffering from mesothelioma the allegation were also found to be defamatory for copenhagen university hospital which in the court view rather acted a the representative for it unnamed management and staff who were also concerned by the accusation in the programme than being a mere institution representing it interest in the form of prestige or commercial success the case thus appears comparable to the situation in thorgeir thorgeirson v iceland cited above in such circumstance the court can agree with the government that there is no basis in the notion of others set out in the second paragraph of article to distinguish between attack on the reputation of medical staff at private hospital a opposed to public hospital having regard thereto and to the particular circumstance of case the court concludes that also in respect of copenhagen university hospital the applicant conviction and sentence were aimed at protecting the reputation of others and had a legitimate aim under article of the conventionc whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic societyi general principle the principle concerning the question of whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are wellestablished in the court caselaw see among other authority delfi a v estonia gc no to echr with further reference the court ha to examine the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact in this context the court recall that the interference aimed at protecting the reputation of an individual consultant s a well a a public body in it capacity of representing it unnamed staff the university hospital see paragraph a regard in particular protection of the reputation of an individual the court ha held that a person reputation even if that person is being criticised in the context of a public debate form part of his or her personal identity and psychological integrity and therefore fall within the scope of his or her private life in order for article to come into play though the attack on personal honour and reputation must attain a certain level of gravity and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see inter alia see delfi cited above axel springer ag v germany gc no february and a v norway no april having been required on numerous occasion to consider dispute requiring an examination of the fair balance to be struck between the right to respect for private life and the right to freedom of expression the court ha developed general principle emerging from abundant caselaw in this area see among other authority couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no to echr extract the criterion which are relevant when balancing the right to freedom of expression against the right to respect for private life are inter alia the contribution to a debate of general interest how wellknown the person concerned is and what the subject of the report is his or her prior conduct the method of obtaining the information and it veracity the content form and consequence of the publication and the severity of the sanction imposed see for example satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no echr extract axel springer ag v germany gc cited above and to february and von hannover v germany no gc no and to echr finally the court reiterates that where the national authority have weighed up the freedom of expression with the right to private life in compliance with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw strong reason are required if it is to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see inter alia von hannover v germany no gc cited above axel springer ag v germany gc cited above lillo stenberg and sæther v norway no january and couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc cited above even though the interference aimed at protecting the reputation of the university hospital which is covered by reputation of others in article and consultant s who is not only covered by the same provision but who may also rely on the right to respect of private life a protected by article of the convention the court will proceed with assessing the proportionality of the interference on the basis of the same criterion see paragraph above in relation to both the university hospital and consultant sii application of those principle to the present caseα the subject matter of the programme and it contribution to a debate of general interest the applicant maintained that the main purpose of the programme wa to perform a critical assessment of the treatment of mesothelioma at copenhagen university hospital compared to treatment by other leading expert and to raise question about whether patient should have been informed of other therapeutic option than vinorelbine it presented the patient and the family frustration over being denied the choice of their preferred chemotherapy especially given the fact that alimta had undergone phase iii examination and thus had been more thoroughly tested than vinorelbine the programme wa not scientific and did not claim to give a scientific account of the advantage of one cancer treatment over another it is evident from the judgment of the domestic court though that the programme also raised the question of whether the applicant had made directly and indirectly allegation that s and copenhagen university hospital had given certain patient suffering from mesothelioma improper treatment resulting in their unnecessary death and the shortening of their life in order to promote s professional esteem and personal financial situation the domestic court acknowledged that such a subject wa of public interest in fact the high court pointed out in it judgment of june that the matter wa an issue of very considerable public interest by stating the following a very considerable public interest is related to journalistic discussion about risk to life and health or suspicion thereof a regard public hospital treatment when balancing consideration of freedom of expression with consideration of the protection of the name and reputation of person and company the former is accorded tremendous weight on the scale that entail acknowledgement of a very farreaching freedom of expression for the press and accordingly the press must be permitted a the public control and information organ public watchdog a certain amount of exaggeration and provocation in connection with their discussion of these question when factually there are reason for expressing criticism the court agrees with the domestic court that the programme dealt with issue of legitimate public interestβ how wellknown the person concerned is and his conduct prior to the programme in the present case the impugned criticism wa directed at s and copenhagen university hospital being a public hospital including it unnamed management and staff who were also concerned by the accusation in the programme see paragraph above they were all vested with official function the court reiterates in this respect that the limit of acceptable criticism are wider a concern public figure than private individual see for example couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc cited above to with further reference the government also accepted that in the present case there wa a need for wider limit for public scrutiny not because copenhagen university hospital could be compared to a public body exercising power in the traditional sense but rather because the activity of the hospital and it condition had an impact on the life and health of individual a similar view wa expressed by the high court see paragraph above when pointing out that in respect of public hospital treatment when balancing consideration of freedom of expression with consideration of the protection of the name and reputation of person and company the former is accorded tremendous weight on the scaleγ content form and consequence of the impugned programme the domestic court found that the applicant in the programme had made allegation that s and copenhagen university hospital had given certain patient suffering from mesothelioma improper treatment resulting in their unnecessary death and the shortening of their life to promote the professional esteem and personal financial situation of s more precisely in it judgment of june the high court found after having seen the programme and by quoting various voiceovers that with these statement the applicant not only passed on assertion by patient relative and expert but also took a stand so that the programme undisputedly gave the viewer the impression that malpractice ha occurred at copenhagen university hospital in that s ha deliberately used medication vinorelbine which is not approved for treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer and whose effect ha not been substantiated that the medication in question wa part of a test and that the test medication ha resulted in patient dying or having their life shortened the way that the programme is built up with it beginning and ending the viewer get the clear impression that the reason behind this choice of medication vinorelbine were s professional prestige and personal finance on this background in the programme the applicant a producer of the programme and a chief subeditor have made an allegation against copenhagen university hospital and s of malpractice and of nourishing irrelevant consideration to the detriment of the life and health of patient such an accusation is likely to disparage copenhagen university hospital and s in the eye of their fellow citizen a set out in article of the penal code it must have been clear to them the applicant that they made such an allegation by way of their presentation of the programme it further concluded that those accusation rested on a factually incorrect basis on the basis of the information in the case including the research material that the applicant possessed before the broadcast of the programme in particular the email from the medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany and the professor from switzerland the reply by the minister for internal affair and health to various question posed by member of parliament and the memorandum of june produced by copenhagen university hospital about pleural mesothelioma cancer it can be established that vinorelbine in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin wa standard treatment at copenhagen university hospital that the european union on september approved the marketing of alimta in connection with cisplatin for treatment of inoperable patient with pleural mesothelioma cancer that there wa no substantiation or basis for believing that an alimtabased treatment wa more efficient than the treatment offered by copenhagen university hospital that some patient at copenhagen university hospital who were already about to receive vinorelbine a standard treatment were chosen and offered the same medicine a part of a test it is not known for what and that s did not make any private financial profit from these test against this background including the fact that the word approved wa not explained during the programme namely the difference between medication approved for treatment and medication approved for marketing and by consistently using the word test medication even though only one patient in the programme participated in test the applicant made allegation which were based on a wrong factual basis of which they must have been aware via the research material the court ha no reason to call into question those conclusion reached by the high court the court is also satisfied that the accusation against s reached the level of seriousness required to fall within the scope of article of the convention see paragraph above the court reiterates that the potential impact of the medium of expression concerned is an important factor in the consideration of the proportionality of an interference and that the audiovisual medium have a more immediate and powerful effect than the print medium see for example jersild v denmark judgment of september series a no the high court found that it wa an aggravating factor that the wrongful accusation were disseminated on national television during primetime and on drs homepage by mean of which the accusation had a significant spread the court note in addition that the programme wa broadcast by one of the two national television station in denmark and described a a documentary which could add to the viewer expectation that they would be presented with the truth the applicant maintained that the impact of their programme wa significant and had various important consequence inter alia a public demand for alimta therapy and a change in practice at copenhagen university hospital all of which highlighted why this kind of journalism wa essential and indispensable in a democratic society the court point out however that the domestic court assessed the material before them which the applicant possessed and concluded that there wa no documentation to show that alimta therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product wa more effective than vinorelbine therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product nor wa there substantiation or basis for believing that an alimtabased treatment wa more efficient than the treatment offered by copenhagen university hospital the court ha found no reason to call into question those conclusion it therefore also accepts that the reason why after the programme had been broadcast the public demand for alimta therapy may have increased and copenhagen university hospital changed it standard therapy for operable patient to cisplatin in combination with alimta wa that the programme on an incorrect factual basis had encouraged patient to mistrust vinorelbine therapy a also stated by s and h before the city court the court further observes that before the city court h added that the programme had created distrust towards both copenhagen university hospital and s that it had created uncertainty in patient and relative and that he himself had subsequently received to hate mailsδ method of obtaining the information and it veracity before the domestic court the applicant maintained that they acted in good faith and in full compliance with press ethic when preparing and airing the programme and that the documentary wa based on substantive and significant journalistic research carried out over a period of approximately one year it included international medical expert and a very broad range of open source material the first applicant also stated that s and copenhagen university hospital had been invited to comment on the allegation in the documentary on numerous occasion the applicant had received the memorandum of june see paragraph above about pleural mesothelioma cancer and it treatment produced by copenhagen university hospital which stressed that international study including of vinorelbine and alimta had not shown that any twocombination regime wa superior to other twocombination regime that information wa confirmed by the professor from switzerland in an email of june and by the medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany in an email of june see paragraph above the memorandum also referred to a fund aimed at developing research on pleural mesothelioma cancer in the amount of dkk received by s from company f and stated that the money had been used to pay nurse and student and for data collection it emerged that there had been no financial profit for the doctor involved the applicant stated that they did not find the memorandum suitable for inclusion in their documentary a it did not answer the specific question asked by them the court note that the domestic court did not dispute that the applicant had conducted thorough research a stated above however based on the particular of the case which included the research material which the applicant had possessed before the programme wa broadcast they found that the applicant had made accusation resting on a factually incorrect basis of which they must be deemed to have become aware through the research material in conclusion the high court stated the aim of the programme to make a critical assessment of the treatment of patient with pleural mesothelioma cancer offered by copenhagen university hospital and the responsible consultant is a legitimate part of the press role a public watchdog but it can not justify an allegation which is built on a factually wrong basis and thus a wrong premise the applicant who did not limit themselves to referring to or disseminating statement by expert patient and relative did not have any basis for making such serious allegation against copenhagen university hospital and s again the court see no reason to call into question the high court conclusion it reiterates that the safeguard afforded by article to journalist in relation to reporting on issue of general interest is subject to the provision that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the ethic of journalism see for example bédat cited above it note in particular that there is no indication that the judicial authority placed a disproportionate and unfair burden on the applicant including a alleged by them requiring under criminal law that they provide medical documentation about alimta compared to vinorelbine finally the high court stated that the allegation made by the applicant could not be justified by the fact that copenhagen university hospital and s refused to participate in the programme the court note in addition that it is not in dispute that copenhagen university hospital participated and cooperated during the preparation of the programme by replying to question by the applicant and furnishing them with relevant information including the memorandum of june produced by s in this respect the court can not ignore the statement by h before the city court see paragraph above that it is quite usual for copenhagen university hospital to surrender material to the press and to answer question but the question of the first applicant were neverending copenhagen university hospital ha spent about a manyear or about dkk on responding to inquiry from the first applicant and huge effort were made to accommodate her requestsε severity of the sanction imposed the defamation proceeding brought by s and copenhagen university hospital against the applicant ended in an order declaring the allegation null and void a criminal conviction of the applicant and a sentence for each of them amounting to dayfines of dkk a total of dkk equal to approximately euro eur the court note that a criminal conviction is a serious sanction having regard to the existence of other mean of intervention and rebuttal particularly through civil remedy see for example perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extract in the circumstance of the present case however the court doe not find the conviction and the sentence excessive or to be of such a kind a to have a chilling effect on the exercise of medium freedom see inter alia pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi with further reference the applicant emphasised that they had also been punished by having to pay legal cost to s and copenhagen university hospital those cost amounted to dkk equal to approximately eur before the city court and dkk equal to approximately eur before the high court the court ha found that the most careful scrutiny on the part of the court is called for when measure taken by a national authority are capable of discouraging the participation of the press in debate over matter of legitimate public concern see for example jersild v denmark cited above and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii in the present case however the court find that the decision that the applicant pay legal cost doe not appear unreasonable or disproportionate see by contrast mgn limited v the united kingdom no january ζ conclusion in the light of all the abovementioned consideration the court considers that the domestic court and most recently the high court in it judgment of june balanced the right of freedom of expression with the right to respect for private life and took into account the criterion set out in the court caselaw the reason relied upon were both relevant and sufficient to show that the interference complained of wa necessary in a democratic society and that the authority of the respondent state acted within their margin of appreciation in striking a fair balance between the competing interest at stake the court therefore concludes that there ha been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the application admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on december pursuant to rule and of the rule of court stanley naismith robert spano registrar president,,,
32,the first applicant franz olivier giesbert is the publication director of the magazine le point the second applicant hervé gattegno is a journalist with le point the third applicant is the company operating le point a background to the proceeding at issue the proceeding against the applicant which form the subject matter of the three application are related to the event commonly referred to a the bettencourt affair mr liliane bettencourt principal shareholder of the group loréal is one of the richest individual in france from the late s she made numerous gift to her friend b a writer and photographer totalling several hundred million euro in value in december mr bettencourts daughter m bettencourt meyers filed a criminal complaint against b for the offence of undue influence abus de faiblesse with the public prosecutor at the nanterre tribunal de grande instance a preliminary investigation wa opened in that context numerous interview were conducted in particular with individual close to mr bettencourt and search were carried out in september b wa taken into police custody without waiting for the outcome of the investigation m bettencourt meyers brought a private prosecution against b in the nanterre criminal court on the same charge of undue influence she sought and obtained the inclusion in the case file of material and report from the preliminary investigation in september the public prosecutor office decided to discontinue the proceeding based on m bettencourt meyers original complaint the case initiated by the private prosecution wa first set down for hearing on september then on december on that date it wa decided to seek a medical assessment of mr bettencourt and the hearing wa deferred again to april for the subsequent criminal proceeding see paragraph and below mr bettencourt publicly announced that she wa refusing to undergo the assessment ordered by the court she also filed submission by way of voluntary intervention including in the alternative an application to join the proceeding a a civil party in the event that the prosecution wa regarded a valid by the court she argued that the aim of her civilparty application wa to persuade the court that her mental faculty were not diminished and that she had made her gift to b with all due lucidity the development in the case were widely reported in the press the offending article in le point were thus published in that context b the offending article the article of december on december the third applicant published with the second applicant byline a fourpage spread under the heading investigation into a very dear friend and with the subheading treasure did he take advantage of liliane bettencourt b denies it but the finger of suspicion point to him the article referred to various aspect of the case and in particular the very significant gift made by the heir of loréal for a total of one billion euro to b the journalist wrote quoting the testimony of liliane bettencourts former accountant she too describes the psychological domination imposed on an elderly lady who is more fragile than she may like he also inserted a passage from the prosecution document which summed up the situation a follows taking advantage of his influence and liliane bettencourts weakness b persuaded her at a time when her health wa declining to give him sum of money and asset going beyond token of friendship the article wa full of comment between inverted comma presented a extract from statement made to the investigator working under the public prosecutor it pointed out that the latter had discontinued the investigation in question among the quotation were explanation given by b when he wa in police custody in september and it wa claimed by the journalist that those explanation were often contradicted by the fact he swears that liliane bettencourt ha acted towards him like a patron their first meeting go back to the s but their friendship date from a portrait he made of her in i wa then sufficiently well off that i did not need financial assistance from mr bettencourt he retorted to the investigator i already owned five apartment on rue servandoni paris th a large collection of painting and had coownership of the brouzet estate a large estate in the gard together with copyright due and a commission on the sale by dior of the perfume poison after verification this inventory seems to be somewhat overstated in actual fact it wa through a series of cheque from the billionaire and the cancellation of astronomical debt to real estate company owned by him that b ha managed to build up his asset to the point of acquiring seven apartment in the welltodo neighbourhood of saint sulpice today the whole complex form a quaint townhouse with swimming pool cctv camera and secret passage between the bookshelf contradicted by the number and date the photographer wa forced to explain more humbly that mr bettencourt wanted him to expand in order to install all his work and perhaps set up a museum but curiously his benefactor did not even mention such a project during her own hearing on may b explanation she is a modest woman she will not say the thing that are in the depth of her heart the police investigation also demonstrates the lavishness of his property in the gard mr bettencourt did not contribute to it financing he claimed however the billionaire accountant testified that numerous cheque had been signed by her made out to contractor doing work on the estate for at least euro and a much a a cheque of million euro in december several employee testified that around the same time the old lady health had deteriorated herein lie the gravamen of the whole case wa the loréal heiress really aware of the extent of her generosity b declared that he had never seen the slightest impairment of her behaviour he even went a far a attributing to the octogenarian on record a remarkable intellectual agility moreover he willingly gave the police officer the name of other beneficiary who had received lavish gift but perhaps not for the same reason he nevertheless conceded the rest of his defence is even more audacious if he is to be believed liliane bettencourt enriched him against his will insisting that he accept gift which he tried to refuse i only knew about these gift when signing for them at the notary office he claimed in relation to the painting she ha given him when asked by the police whether the notary had expressed any reservation he replied no on the contrary the notary told me that the money came from mr bettencourts income and that she wa responsible enough to be in control of what she wa doing here again the reality is rather le clear the notary in question wa originally introduced to liliane bettencourt to deal with the photographer real estate acquisition then he replaced the family notary and all document relating to life insurance were transferred to his practice i no longer recall whether i knew him before he worked for mr bettencourt said b in an embarrassed semiconfession several employee say he wa behind her choice his protest that he wa disinterested are also at odds with a number of finding especially this answer liliane bettencourt gave herself to the police asked if her protégé had ever refused her generosity she replied no when the investigator confronted him with this answer the photographer wa forced to concede i have never refused gift that have already been recorded in notarial act thats a bit different in addition to these oddity there are two damning statement in the file those two statement are extract from the testimony of the former director of loréal once responsible for the management of liliane bettencourts asset and her former accountant the first spoke of a hold over mr bettencourt he had asked to be relieved of his duty because he testified i ran the risk of being complicit in the misdeed of mr b by my tacit consent the second witness referred to pressure on the part of the photographer and testified that he wa always asking for money in late her attention wa drawn to the proposed assignment of a life insurance policy for an amount in excess of million euro i tried to reason with mr bettencourt but she wa no longer her old self recalled the accountant i then bumped into b in the house and said to him youve seen the state she is in you know she is very ill he replied never mind a long a she is not under deputyship she can still sign the article also contained comment made by mr bettencourt on may in a box headed exclusive what liliane bettencourt told the police the journalist after quoting extract from the statement showing that mr bettencourt did not recall the agreement she had signed with b wrote that these memory lapse are clearly at odds with the picture that b would be painting of her to the same investigator in another box the journalist reported on the application for judicial protection filed by mr bettencourts daughter and quoted an extract from the report of neurologist pa who had been asked by the public prosecutor to examine the billionaire medical record revealing a state of vulnerability related to a probable degenerative neurological condition which impaired her individual faculty the article stated that from this episode and many others the financial brigade investigator in a report of december had concluded that there wa a series of sufficiently strong presumption that the offence of undue influence had been committed by b and that the photographer for his part had denounced an odious attack on a worldfamous artist it ended thus the court will rule whether the fortune passed to him by liliane bettencourt wa a windfall or a swindle either way it a masterstroke the article of february on february the third applicant published with the second applicant byline an article indicated on the full front cover of the magazine under the headline bettencourt affair how to gain one billion without any effort the subheading announcing the article read the unbelievable story of a society photographer who made a fortune by seducing liliane bettencourt the richest woman in france and the accusation of madam employee a photomontage showing mr bettencourt with her friend b also appeared on the cover the subject of the article which extended to eight page wa indicated a follows bettencourt affair ha the richest woman in france been conned by the photographer b some of her former employee have said a much to the police le point reveals their testimony and the secret of this incredible highsociety melodrama the article began a follows is it about money or sentiment a quarrel over an inheritance or a question of principle a settling of family score or the most perfect scam all of these thing put together perhaps and much more because the million slip away by their hundred in an atmosphere redolent of an agatha christie novel and a setting worthy of scott fitzgerald even the trial the inevitable epilogue will resemble a highsociety event on and april the court of nanterre will look into the incredible generosity for almost a decade of the richest woman in france towards the person she ha made her favourite the photographer b the article continued a follows since the billionaire daughter ha taken her case to the court accusing her mother protégé of the offence of undue influence ripple of disgust have been felt along the majestic avenue of neuilly and beyond the high society of paris in finance industry and politics concerned that it may one day be regretted that no one had seen anything or at least said anything for the investigation ha revealed the existence of lavish gift apparently totalling around billion euro could such rich pas unnoticed there a disturbing detail the largest sum were assigned to b in the spring of and in the summer of at a time when liliane bettencourts health wa declining sharply guru much testimony ha come to light since then le point is exclusively publishing several extract see the following page housemaid nurse secretary the chauffeur accountant all describe the hold that b had over the loreal heiress aged his own individual way of soliciting her generosity the equivocal aspect of his behaviour before the court the succession of these indignant employee will be reminiscent of the spectacle in the von bülow affair the trial of the libertine and cynical american aristocrat who wa accused in the early s on rhode island of poisoning his wife so that he could take over her fortune but even that scenario would not be the worst for b convicted at first instance von bülow wa nevertheless acquitted on appeal for the time being the photographer confronts the suspicion with sardonic contempt to make a work of one life thats what matter he proclaimed in le monde describing the charge against him a pathetic rumour his benefactor an intelligent woman who know how to choose men to take risk he told the police sweeping a little too quickly under the carpet the doubt about her state of health to be sure the heiress affirmed a year ago in le journal du dimanche that she wa attached to b and that she had no time for gossip she ha since shut herself away leaving her lawyer to speak in her place refusing any medical assessment and cutting short her appearance at reception or ceremony this silence ha only served to reinforce the impression of a woman under influence in the middle of the article under the heading exclusive the woman who accuse there were long extract over three page from statement of employee who worked at mr bettencourts house accountant secretary chambermaid nurse that had been given during the preliminary investigation the following statement were highlighted in particular it wa a if b had woven his web around mr bettencourt he answered me a long a she is not under deputyship she can sign b take advantage of madame weakness to benefit from her generosity after referring to remark by b and by mr bettencourt in the press the article added a number of statement paint a le idyllic picture under oath employee and servant mentioned pressing request for money going a far a harassment harsh language and various scheme bordering on the sordid under an intermediate heading strategy the article then mentioned and partially quoted document that had been discovered by the financial investigator at b home in paris the article ended with a small insert indicating that b had refused to respond to le point preferring to reserve his answer for the judge c the proceeding brought against the applicant following the publication of the impugned article the urgent proceeding brought by mr bettencourt application no on february following the publication of february mr bettencourt brought urgent proceeding against the applicant in the paris tribunal de grande instance claiming a manifestly unlawful nuisance under article and of the code of civil procedure she asked the urgentapplications judge to find that the reproduction of procedural document from the file of the preliminary investigation initiated by the nanterre public prosecutor breached section of the law of july on freedom of the press section which prohibited the publication of document from a criminal case file before they had been read out in open court and article of the civil code guaranteeing the right to respect for private life she requested that a courtordered notice be published in le point on pain of a coercive fine and that the applicant be ordered to pay her by way of an advance compensation for her nonpecuniary damage on account of her portrayal a an individual with diminished intellectual faculty who had been duped the applicant disputed mr bettencourts standing to bring the proceeding a prosecution in respect of the section offence could only be initiated by the public prosecutor under section of the same law on the merit they claimed that it wa contradictory on the one hand to require journalist to establish the veracity of the information that they published and on the other to penalise them for substantiating their investigation in a decision of march the vice president of the paris tribunal de grande instance found that mr bettencourt had standing in so far a she wa arguing that the publication of the impugned document had on the basis of that provision caused her personal damage the judge indicated that while section of the law reserved the prosecution of the section offence for the public prosecutor an individual who claimed to have sustained pecuniary or nonpecuniary damage a a result of a publication wa entitled to act a a civil party in the proceeding or to bring a case before the urgentapplications judge under article of the code of civil procedure in order to seek the requisite protective or remedial measure to put an end to the unlawful nuisance resulting from such publication or to request a sum by way of an advance the judge explained it suffices for the publication of the document prior to their reading in open court to have caused the person actual and direct damage regardless whether or not the person is a party to the proceeding in which the document are to be presented he ordered the applicant jointly to pay an advance of euro eur and the same sum in procedural expense under article of the code of civil procedure a to the application of section of the act the judge took the view that the statement by employee of mr bettencourt paragraph above constituted procedural document which were part of the preliminary investigation and that even though it had been discontinued those document had been joined to the criminal proceeding now pending after their transmission had been sought and obtained by m bettencourt meyers in support of her own private prosecution he added that those statement all helped the case for the prosecution a indicated on the magazine cover the accusation of madame employee and observed a follows the publication of long passage emanating from insider help to give the reported fact an appearance of authenticity and objectivity that the article doe not seek to nuance but on the contrary to reinforce the reader is thus led to regard those fact a proven because they are presented through the prism of a journalist analysis which is bound to contain a degree of subjectivity or opinion for those reason the alleged breach of section can not be combined with the breach under article of the civil code presumption of innocence or article of the civil code private life or section of the law of july defamation proceeding nor can it result in redress on the basis of those separate legal provision the judge concluded that the publication wa capable of infringing the right of mr bettencourt a it portrayed her at a time when the nanterre criminal court had not yet begun to examine the criminal case a a woman who wa manipulated and weak a description that she categorically denied the judge further found that the applicant were not justified in relying on the provision of article of the convention and the necessity of information in this connection he indicated that section sought mainly to preserve the independence and orderly conduct of the judicial process in addition to protecting the right of the person concerned particularly by guaranteeing the presumption of innocence he emphasised the limited and temporary nature of the restriction on freedom of expression a the legislation did not prevent analysis of or comment on procedural material or the publication of information gleaned from the proceeding themselves but only prohibited the reproduction of document which were intended for public disclosure in the context of a judicial process surrounded by safeguard these safeguard include respect for defence right and the principle of adversarial proceeding which could not be ensured by a prior isolated and partial medium report the judge went on to explain a follows the impugned restriction can not be compared to the case of disclosure of professional secret or of secret from the preliminary or judicial investigation on account of the possession by a journalist of document covered by secrecy and used in publication imparting information to the general public in so far a the journalist who is not bound by those secret is required to posse such document in order to justify the veracity of the fact reported or the seriousness of his investigation but also to use them in compliance with the applicable legislation all of the claim submitted by mr bettencourt alleging a breach of her privacy were dismissed on the ground that such a breach had not been sufficiently established having regard to the general public right to be informed and interest in being informed of current affair or event in the general interest the claimant ha not relied on any specific breach of her private life which would go beyond the information that it is permitted to mention in connection with the criminal case before the court of nanterre a le point did not in particular provide detail about any health problem she may have the applicant appealed they argued in particular that the procedural document in question which had been included in the case file solely on the initiative of the claimant and not on that of the public prosecutor could not be regarded a carrying the degree of authority which justified by derogation to the principle of freedom of expression the prohibition imposed by section they further emphasised that neither mr bettencourts right to a fair hearing nor any undermining of the authority or impartiality of the court wa at stake in a judgment of march the paris court of appeal upheld the decision of the court below in the main and raised the amount of the advance to eur in addition to charging eur for the cost of the appeal proceeding it confirmed that the witness statement clearly constituted procedural document even though the preliminary investigation had been discontinued since they had been transmitted by the public prosecutor at the request of the civil party and thus formed an integral part of the criminal proceeding in the court view the fact that they were transmitted at the request of the civil party and not on the initiative of the public prosecutor bore little relevance in this connection it concluded that the publication of long passage from those statement constituted a violation of section and thus an unlawful nuisance within the meaning of article of the code of civil procedure it added a follows the requirement for the journalist to verify his source and to compare the various material available to him on a given subject in the context of a serious investigation before imparting information to the public doe not mean reproducing verbatim the document used for his investigation where a in the present case such publication is prohibited under press legislation of which he can not be unaware the court concluded that the applicant submission that section should be declared incompatible with article of the convention wa unfounded it took the view that mr bettencourt wa entitled to claim nonpecuniary damage a she had been portrayed asa woman in a weak mental state being easy to manipulate and under the influence of b which the reader is all the more likely to regard a the truth a the observation are presented a emanating from individual who have played a particular role making them privileged observer of her private life lastly the court of appeal confirmed that there had been no breach of mr bettencourts privacy in the following term the mere mention of mr bettencourts mental health in the body of the article without any detail falling within her private sphere and in the testimony reproduced which wa mainly about the conduct and manoeuvre attributed to b doe not suffice to establish any particular breach of the respondent privacy that would go beyond the limit of legitimate information that the public is entitled to expect about a case which already being widely covered by the medium is before the court the applicant appealed on point of law in their ground of appeal they argued under article of the convention that they had a duty to inform the public about a case pending before the court which had been revived after a private prosecution following it discontinuance by the public prosecutor and which had given rise to wide medium coverage especially on account of the personality and wealth of mr bettencourt that the judgment of the court of appeal had found against them solely for publishing the statement extract and not on account of their content that there had been no impairment of the interest protected by section because mr bettencourt wa not the defendant in the proceeding that there wa a manifest contradiction in the court of appeal position a it had declared mr bettencourts action admissible on the basis of the damage sustained while taking the view that she had not been portrayed a a weak and manipulated woman in term of her right to respect for her private life in a judgment of april the court of cassation dismissed the applicant appeal and ordered them to pay mr bettencourt the sum of eur in cost it gave the following reason for it decision the judgment observes that long extract were published from the statement taken during the preliminary investigation in which mr bettencourt wa portrayed a a manipulated and weak woman proceeding with a correct application of article of the convention the court of appeal wa able without contradicting itself to conclude from that publication since the document drawn up by the police during an investigation are procedural document within the meaning of section of the law of july that mr bettencourt wa justified in claiming solely on the basis of that publication that she had sustained personal damage urgent proceeding brought by b application no on february b brought urgent proceeding against the applicant in the paris tribunal de grande instance following the publication of february arguing that it had caused him a manifestly unlawful nuisance infringing both his copyright to the photograph illustrating the article and his defence right including his right to be presumed innocent in a decision of march the vice president of the paris tribunal de grande instance in addition to endorsing the reasoning already set out in paragraph and above took the view that the impugned publication could have the alleged effect infringing b right to a fair hearing and his right to the presumption of innocence b claim concerning the infringement allegedly caused by the reproduction of photograph wa rejected a falling outside the remit of the urgent proceeding judge the judge ordered the publication of a notice inside the magazine together with an indication of it on the cover to take up one half of the page in bold type under the heading judgment against le point in proceeding brought by b and on the weekly magazine website the applicant were also ordered jointly to pay b an advance of eur on compensation for his nonpecuniary damage together with an equivalent sum by way of procedural expense the applicant appealed in a judgment of march the paris court of appeal upheld the decision appealed against mainly in the same term a those set out in paragraph above it reiterated that the witness statement without engaging in any extensive interpretation of section could be characterised a procedural document even though the investigation had been discontinued the fact that they were transmitted at the request of the private prosecutor and not on the initiative of the public prosecutor is of little relevance in this connection because they support the prosecution case it went on to find that consequently the mere publication of substantial extract from those statement before they had been referred to or read out in open court had indeed constituted a violation of section of the law of july and therefore an unlawful nuisance the court of appeal further found a follows the four statement thus presented to the public portray b a a devious and unscrupulous individual using seduction manoeuvre and psychological pressure to persuade liliane bettencourt to grant him substantial and frequent gift at a time when she wa weak and when her husband state of health had declined the reader is all the more likely to consider these statement to be true supporting a they do the accusation against b before the nanterre criminal court a they are presented a emanating from individual who a a result of the service they rendered to her nurse chambermaid secretary played a particular role through which they became privileged observer of her private life the reader is thus led to believe in the accusation even before the court hearing the case ha been able to reach it decision in condition that breach the respondent right to be presumed innocent and his defence right the applicant lodged an appeal on point of law in a judgment of july the court of cassation dismissed their appeal in the same term a those of it judgment of april see paragraph above proceeding on the merit brought by b application no on march b brought proceeding against the applicant on the merit before the paris tribunal de grande instance seeking redress for the damage sustained on account of the publication of the article of december and february in breach of section of the act in a judgment of june that court dismissed all of b claim on the admissibility of his suit it observed that the applicant were correct to assert that an individual who claimed to be the victim of the offence provided for under section of the act wa not authorised to bring a private prosecution on that basis it pointed out that by contrast the provision of that act did not preclude the injured party from bringing proceeding in the civil court a only one section of that act section prohibited the bringing of civil proceeding separately from a public prosecution namely in case of defamation against public authority state institution and civil servant after observing that section usefully contributed to preserving the orderly functioning and impartiality of the justice system and to guarantee due process since the full and verbatim publication of document from a criminal file before the trial could hinder the conduct of pending investigation or influence individual who might subsequently be called upon to testify or even lay magistrate who might have to adjudicate upon the case the court gave the following reason for it decision the prohibition that it establishes must not however restrict the ability of journalist to report on criminal case even those which have not yet been publicly examined by a court and specifically those which raising issue of general interest involving significant interest or concerning people with highlevel responsibility especially in political economic or artistic field particularly deserve to be brought to public attention the application of this legislation can not in particular have the effect of precluding journalist from imparting to their reader in such a case all or part of the documentary resource from which they derived their information in order to establish it credibility or which substantiate their commentary and analysis in order to submit them for open discussion this is the case here extract from report which have been drawn up by the police acting on the instruction of the public prosecutor and which have been appended after the discontinuance of the proceeding for which they were produced to the file of further proceeding brought directly by a civil party in a criminal court those extract therefore were included by the second applicant in two successive article which were each the result of a journalistic investigation and sought to present reader with information analysis and comment on a criminal case that would soon be adjudicated upon by a court that involved considerable financial interest and concerned one of the richest individual in france and a photographer and writer who ha a he himself boast undeniable success and notoriety in the first of the impugned text short quotation from procedural document which are reproduced in quotation mark in the body of the article and are therefore fully integrated into the journalist writing mention certain fact and offer an analysis thereof in the second text the three page of extract from procedural document are included in a broader editorial presentation consisting essentially of a fourpage spread and a large photograph of the person concerned from which they are indissociable the journalist expressly refers to those extract in his article analysing them and basing his conclusion on them if one were to accept in those circumstance that these two body of text should be examined by this court only on the basis of the strictliability offence under section of the freedom of the press act that would lead a the respondent rightly argue to preventing them from initiating the debate that is warranted by the journalist work within which the impugned extract are merely one element and they would be deprived in the present case of the defence made available by law to person who are prosecuted for defamation or for a breach of the right to be presumed innocent in other word precluding them from proving the veracity of the allegation or at least the journalist good faith and from submitting argument to the effect that the impugned text do not contain any final conclusion expressing a biased view that the person in question is definitely guilty it should be noted in this connection that the claimant directs his main criticism in his writ of summons against the comment and analysis that the journalist ha been led to write under his own name by the procedural document cited and that he mainly reproduces in that writ only those comment and not the quotation that he is supposed to be challenging it should be observed in particular that the claimant complains that the statement from which extract were quoted or in reality the journalist analysis thereof breached his right to be presumed innocent and were presented a damning and particularly incriminating it can be concluded that b himself admits that absent his chosen basis of action he had other option at his disposal a private prosecution or civil proceeding for defamation or a civil action for a breach of his right to be presumed innocent both of those course of action would have entailed fair proceeding ensuring respect for the equality of arm and he wa not therefore deprived of his right to have access to a court in order to secure respect for his right in those circumstance the upholding in the present case of the claim that he ha submitted under would constitute a restriction of freedom of expression devoid of any necessity in a democratic society in a judgment of february the paris court of appeal overturned that judgment it found that the impugned publication infringed b right to a fair trial with respect for his defence right including the right to be presumed innocent and breached section of the act it ordered the applicant jointly to pay b the sum of eur for each publication by way of compensation and eur in expense under article of the code of civil procedure it also ordered the publication on pain of a coercive fine of a notice containing the operative provision of the judgment in le point and on the magazine website the court of appeal explained that the assessment of the offending publication clearly went beyond the framework of that of socalled procedural offence and that it would have to be carried out with regard to article of the convention and to the question whether the interference with the applicant freedom of expression wa necessary to protect the reputation or right of others and to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a regard the article of december the court noted that it had been published the day before b appearance in the criminal court and that it clearly suggested that he wa guilty a he wa portrayed a an individual against whom there wa a series of sufficiently strong presumption that he had committed the offence of undue influence it took the view that the court below had wrongly regarded the aim of informing the public a prevailing over the mean used namely illegal method whereby extract had been selected from statement collected in an investigation in order to show that b had committed the offence of undue influence whereas there had been no judicial decision to that effect it could be understood by the reader that b wa not telling the truth about mr bettencourts mental health and that his guilt wa doubly suggested in the introduction citing an extract from the prosecution document which fell under section and in the conclusion it added a follows the reasoning given by the court below is tantamount to legitimising the practice which is legally prohibited of publishing extract from an investigation file before they are read out in open court first on account of the interest of the subject and secondly while noting b claim that his right to be presumed innocent wa breached the court can not agree with the reasoning of the court below the article of december in so far a it portrays b a having committed the offence of undue influence visàvis mr bettencourt in the abovementioned context clearly breach his right to a fair trial including to the presumption of innocence that breach according to the article is exclusively based on the publication of extract from statement which legally speaking are not addressed to journalist when they are not party to the proceeding the court would reiterate that for a reader who ha an average knowledge of the court document from judicial investigation take on particular credibility and an undeniable evidential value the court reach the conclusion that the date of publication the choice of quotation and the portrayal of b a guilty according to the document from the judicial investigation even though it had been discontinued had the consequence of influencing his exercise which wa legally and conventionally guaranteed of his defence right which meant that before being heard by a court he should not have been portrayed a guilty of the offence of undue influence against mr bettencourt b thus find himself required to give explanation on evidence against him which ha not yet been debated in a court of law and which ha been taken from an investigation then still secret conducted under the supervision of a judge it is not befitting to consider a did the court below that b had other course of action available to him being entitled to bring his case to the civil court under section it can not be suggested to the claimant that he should have opted for other type of proceeding on the erroneous ground that his action contravenes article of the convention a regard the article of february the court of appeal took the view that the editorial choice front cover of the magazine presentation of whole swathe of statement highlighting of the exclusive publication of the witness statement constituted a communication of some importance directly aimed at b who had not been able to explain before a court his position on the accusation of the staff it added that the publication portrayed b a being accused by third party in conclusive term and that the article wa a repeated incrimination of b two month before a hearing at which the epilogue of the case wa supposed to take place the applicant appealed on point of law in their ground of appeal they argued in particular that the ban on publishing procedural document wa a matter of defence of the general interest falling within the sole jurisdiction of the public prosecutor and that a private person could not seek redress for damage on that basis they added that their argument wa supported by the fact that b could have under article of the civil code used another legal remedy to ensure the protection of his interest and that the interference with freedom of expression and of information had therefore not been justified or proportionate in a judgment of may giving the following reason the court of cassation dismissed the applicant appeal having found first that the article of december wa based on an analysis of extract from various statement taken by the criminal investigation police in order to portray b a having taken advantage of mr bettencourts weakness the day before his appearance before a criminal court which wa to rule on the relevance and merit of the accusation made against him by her daughter and secondly that the article of february based on a partial reproduction of statement taken by the criminal investigation police seeking to portray b a being accused by third party in conclusive term in order to lead the reader to believe that the case against him wa made out two month before a hearing which would constitute according to the article the epilogue of the case the court of appeal reached the conclusion that the publication had infringed b right to a fair trial with due respect for his right to be presumed innocent and his defence right d development in the bettencourt affair since the publication of the offending article after june there were many development in the case with it various political and financial repercussion and they were widely reported in the medium on november the court of cassation ordered the transfer of all the aspect of the bettencourt case to the bordeaux tribunal de grande instance mr bettencourts daughter withdrew her claim but the criminal proceeding were later resumed and on december b wa placed under judicial investigation for the offence of undue influence in a judgment of may b wa found guilty of that offence and sentenced to three year imprisonment of which six month were suspended a fine of eur and the payment of eur million in damage awarded to mr bettencourt in a judgment of august the bordeaux court of appeal upheld the judgment in respect of the prosecution case and varied the sentence giving b a fouryear suspended prison sentence fining him eur and ordering the confiscation of part of his property the court of appeal also took the view that it did not need to make an award of damage on account of settlement that had been agreed between the party iii relevant european instrument the court refers to recommendation rec of the council of europe committee of minister to the member state on the provision of information through the medium in relation to criminal proceeding adopted by the committee of minister on july see bédat v switzerland gc no echr the lawii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant alleged that the civillaw sanction imposed on them under section of the act had entailed a violation of article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary b merit the party submissionsa the applicant the applicant acknowledged that the sanction imposed on them were based on legislation namely section of the act but they argued first that this provision wa not sufficiently foreseeable a regard it wording they claimed that the notion of document from a criminal case file and read out in open court were not clear moreover it would be impossible for a journalist to know what would be possible or impossible to reproduce or how many line he could publish from a document in the criminal case file without being regarded a breaching the highly formal statutory prohibition in the applicant view it wa unquestionable that the relatively brief quotation of statement in press article on judicial proceeding wa something extremely common and that this situation did not usually entail prosecution they pointed out that journalist were justified in giving credibility to information that they imparted to the public paradoxically section obliged them to distance themselves from the strict reality of the judicial proceeding on which they were reporting the applicant alleged that the impugned ban wa general formal and unforeseeable the fact that b had preferred to rely on section which wa a little used remedy could be explained by a preference for legislation which would be applied almost automatically in their view this provision had enabled b and mr bettencourt to obtain the judgment against them quite easily whereas proceeding under article and of the civil code protecting private life and the presumption of innocence or a defamation suit in b case would have failed mr bettencourt had indeed been unsuccessful in her action under article of the civil code their legal action had thus sought to circumvent any debate on the legitimacy of the information the reality of the fact mentioned in the impugned document the quality of the journalist investigative work or the way in which the article had really been drafted a a whole the applicant emphasised that they had not sought to hide the context of the case that they had taken precaution in order to include the claimant denial and that the reader had been in a position to ass the scope and meaning of the statement in question it had also been pointed out that b wa refusing to speak to le point the applicant further argued that the proceeding brought by b illustrated that unforeseeability two separate bench of the division specialising in medium law in the urgent proceeding and on the merit had reached diametrically opposite conclusion on the same publication secondly the applicant took the view that the domestic court had not convincingly defined the legitimate aim pursued on the one hand mr bettencourts right not to be portrayed a a manipulated and weak woman wa vague and her state of health wa the central subject of the case but this had not been taken into account on the other the right of b to be presumed innocent had not been breached because otherwise he would have brought proceeding under article of the civil code lastly they claimed that section did not serve to protect the authority of the court and their act or the impartiality of the justice system because the right of mr bettencourt and of b to a fair hearing wa not at issue they had access to the case file and to the same document with all the procedural safeguard provided for by law the applicant argued that the french legislature had sought primarily to preserve the independence of lay jury by enacting section of the press act in the present case by contrast the trial court wa made up of professional judge who moreover were going to rule on claim submitted by a private prosecutor thirdly the applicant argued that the judgment against them had been neither necessary in a democratic society nor proportionate in the light of the demand of information about a highprofile case with reference to further development in the case in particular it transfer to another region see paragraph above and producing a representative sample of what had been publicly disseminated the applicant spoke of hundred or even thousand of article and took the view that the case wa a perfect example of the role of the press a watchdog of democracy in their submission the public debate at that level did not leave much room for restriction on freedom of expression they pointed out in this connection that the present application were different from those in tourancheau and july v france no november which had concerned an article on a banal criminal case before an assize court concerning party unknown to the public the applicant lastly observed that the press had a duty to report on pending court case with supporting evidence and document without having to wait for a judicial outcome which might take several more year in this case seven year to wait that long would not have been compatible with the necessity of information in the bettencourt affairb the government the government argued that the interference wa prescribed by law section of the act wa an integral part of the published and accessible legislation moreover caselaw had established that the impugned prohibition applied to all document from criminal case file and had set it scope which included extract from such document they cited tourancheau and july cited above lastly the domestic court had examined the relevant publication in the light of article of the convention see paragraph above in the present case they pointed out that the published document were report drawn up by investigator during a preliminary criminal investigation the discontinuance of which wa of little import and that the applicant had been aware of their origin they explained that the ban on the publication of document before being read out in open court wa clearly referring to the hearing during which the party would be able to express their view on the content of those document in a public hearing before a court of law the government noted in this connection that the impugned article had themselves made reference to the forthcoming criminal court hearing lastly the difference in solution between the decision of the urgent application judge on march and that of the tribunal de grande instance on june could not be interpreted a a demonstration of the unforeseeability of the law a decision in urgent proceeding did not by any mean prejudge the solution to be decided on the merit on the one hand and the use of remedy had enabled a uniform interpretation of section in accordance with the court caselaw on the other the government concluded that the interference had been prescribed by law after stating that in any event the applicant were wellinformed professional who were familiar with the caselaw and had access if necessary to appropriate legal advice the government further observed that the interference had pursued the aim of the protection of the right of others namely mr bettencourts right to a fair hearing a the published testimony portrayed her a a woman easy to manipulate when she had filed a voluntary intervention with the court see paragraph above and the protection of b defence right and right to be presumed innocent it had further sought to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a the impugned article had been capable of influencing the criminal court they pointed out that regardless of it composition whether professional judge or lay juror the court dealing with a case had to appear impartial for the person called upon to provide explanation on the fact in question that wa not the case where a prejudgment on the fact had already been formed in public opinion and in the press a to the necessity of the impugned interference the government observed that on the date of publication of the first article the court wa supposed to be ruling the next day on the admissibility of the relevant case whilst at the time when the second article wa published it had still not examined the case on the merit they took the view that the domestic court had fully analysed the content of the article the choice of presentation and the substance of the statement together with the context of their publication before finding that there had been a breach first of mr bettencourts right to a fair hearing and second of b right to be presumed innocent after noting the slanted nature of the presentation of the statement obviously directed in favour of the prosecution case the court had taken particular consideration of the fact that reader were likely to believe the reported fact to be true on account of the special credibility attached to document from criminal proceeding and the highlighting of the testimony and identity of the witness in the government view the ground given by the domestic court in the three case thus appeared relevant and sufficient unlike the applicant the government took the view that the choice of the course of action namely section rather than article of the civil code had been pertinent in the present case they explained that the interest protected by the former provision were not limited to respect for the presumption of innocence and that in the present case the right to a fair hearing defence right and respect for the authority and orderly functioning of the judicial system were also at issue the government emphasised in that connection that it wa the very publication of the statement which through their presentation had breached the right of mr bettencourt and of b to a fair hearing and to the impartiality of the court they thus took the view that the application of section had been necessary and that the applicant could not complain that the domestic court had found against them on that basis because the aim of that provision wa not to penalise act of defamation in the government submission the interest of the published information had to be assessed at the date of it publication the prohibition of that publication remained valid for a long a the procedural document concerned had not been examined in open court and it duration wa strictly proportionate to the aim pursued it therefore did not matter that the party had not ultimately been heard in court that the case had been relocated that mr bettencourts daughter had withdrawn her claim or that the reading of the statement in open court had never taken place the government emphasised that the domestic court had fully assessed both the implication and the imperative inherent in freedom of expression in that context in the present case the permissible limit of reporting had been exceeded the impugned article had been manifestly directed in favour of the prosecution case leading the reader to believe that the fact in the published statement were true at a time when mr bettencourt and b had not yet been heard by a judge in addition to the damage caused to those individual the publication had not therefore satisfied the obligation of the press to inform the public objectively moreover the accusation of undue influence made against b had not raised a question of general interest of which the public had to be informed it wa just a banal news story the fact bore no relation to the management of the loréal group and therefore had no implication for the general public the government lastly argued that the pecuniary penalty imposed could not be regarded a excessive or a capable of having a chilling effect on the exercise of medium freedom the court assessment in the present case the impugned decision against the applicant could clearly be seen a an interference with their right to freedom of expression and this wa not in dispute between the party such interference will breach the convention if it fails to satisfy the criterion set out in the second paragraph of article the court must therefore determine whether it wa prescribed by law whether it pursued one or more of the legitimate aim listed in that paragraph and whether it wa necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve that aim or aimsa whether the interference wa prescribed by law a the court ha already found many time in it judgment the expression prescribed by law and in accordance with the law in article to of the convention not only require that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law but also refer to the quality of the law in question the law should be accessible to the person concerned and formulated with sufficient precision to enable them to foresee to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstance the consequence which a given action may entail see among many other authority fernández martínez v spain gc no echr in addition a law may still satisfy the requirement of foreseeability even if the person concerned ha to take appropriate legal advice to ass to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstance the consequence which a given action may entail this is particularly true in relation to person carrying out a professional activity who are used to having to proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation see tourancheau and july cited above in the present case the party disagree a to whether section is sufficiently foreseeable the court ha previously found that these provision are foreseeable a required by article of the convention and doe not see any reason to depart from that analysis it would refer to it judgment in tourancheau and july on this point cited above and in addition the first two applicant are wellinformed medium professional and they were in a position to ass the risk that they incurred when they published the article ibid lastly a indicated by the government the difference in assessment between that of an urgent proceeding judge and that of a court ruling on the merit which did not have the same function did not demonstrate that the judicial decision were unforeseeable or contradictory in conclusion the applicant could not argue that they had been unable to foresee to a reasonable degree the consequence that the impugned publication might have for them judicially the court concludes that the interference wa prescribed by law within the meaning of the second paragraph of article of the conventionb whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim the court observes that the party disagree a to the legitimate aim pursued by this interference which according to the applicant were not clearly defined they claimed that the damage to mr bettencourts right wa not precisely defined that b right to the presumption of innocence wa not at issue a the case had not been brought under article of the civil code and that the aim of protecting the orderly functioning of the justice system wa not realistic in relation to a bench of professional judge the court take the view that the applicant argument are to be addressed in an assessment of the necessity of the interference and are not such a to call into question the legitimate aim it note in this connection that the national court contended that section sought to preserve the independence and orderly functioning of the justice system a well a protecting the right of the individual concerned in particular by upholding the principle of the presumption of innocence see paragraph and above it agrees with the government that the interference in question sought in respect of b to protect his right to a fair hearing with due respect for the presumption of innocence a to mr bettencourt who admittedly wa not the accused in the proceeding the court note that denying that she wa the weak and manipulated woman portrayed by the impugned article she had filed submission to be joined a a civil party in the proceeding before the criminal court whose task it had been to ass her degree of awareness at the time when she had granted her gift to b the purpose of the interference therefore a far a she is concerned wa to protect her right while guaranteeing the proper administration of justice in order to avoid any external influence on the judicial proceeding those aim correspond to the protection of the reputation and right of others and the maintaining of the authority and impartiality of the judiciary in so far a the latter expression ha been interpreted a encompassing the right enjoyed by individual a litigant in general see tourancheau and july cited above c whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society in the bédat judgment cited above the court laid down criterion to guide the national authority of the state party to the convention when weighing in the balance the article right on the one hand and the public and private interest protected by the secrecy of the judicial investigation on the other even though the applicant were not charged with breaching the secrecy of the judicial investigation a charge which can not be brought against french journalist or with the offence of knowingly deriving an advantage from a breach of that secrecy see ressiot and others v france no and and june the court take the view that the criterion set out in the bédat judgment are applicable mutatis mutandis to the present case since the complaint submitted by the applicant on whom sanction were imposed for the publication of document from criminal proceeding before they had been read out in open court raise similar question relating to the competing right under article and of the convention those criterion are a follows how the applicant came into possession of the information at issue the content of the impugned article the contribution of the article to a publicinterest debate the article influence on the criminal proceeding any breach of the defendant privacy and the proportionality of the sanction imposedi how the applicant came into possession of the information the court note a to the question of how the impugned procedural document came to the applicant knowledge and reiterating that this is not necessarily a determining factor in assessing whether or not a journalist complied with his duty and responsibility when publishing the information see bédat cited above that it ha not been alleged that they obtained the document illegally or fraudulently however the applicant could not have been unaware of the origin of the document or of the confidential nature of the information that they were going to publish section doe not penalise or cover the condition in which a document from a case file ha been obtained merely the publication of such a document that being said the applicant must have known that the verbatim publication of part of those document would run counter to the prohibition in the relevant legislationii the content of the impugned articlesα the article of december reiterating that article cover in addition to the substance of the idea and information expressed possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation see bédat cited above and case cited therein the court note that the assessment of the content of the impugned article wa not the same at first instance and on appeal for the court below the choice of the publication namely short quotation from statement incorporated into the journalist analysis and the medium coverage of the case justified the refusal to uphold b claim under section a that provision could not prevent journalist from reporting on criminal case raising question of general interest see paragraph above the court of appeal took the view that the impugned article had portrayed b a guilty of the offence of undue influence see paragraph above a confirmed by the court of cassation see paragraph above the court for it part observes that while the journalist remained prudent not setting out any explicit conclusion in the article of december the entire content of that article sought to show that b wa guilty this is evident from the subheading of the publication did he take advantage of liliane bettencourt b denies it but the finger of suspicion point to him but also in the slanted comment from the selected passage of the prosecution document the extract from b statement in police custody and witness statement together with the report of the financial brigade which expressed the view that there wa a series of sufficiently strong presumption that the offence of undue influence had been committed by b the article used quotation repeatedly to highlight the contradiction and weakness in b position and conveyed information to the public in a biased manner through the choice of expression such a here again the reality is rather le clear an embarrassed semiconfession or two damning statementsβ the article of february visàvis mr bettencourt and b the court note that the urgent proceeding judge examined the content of the article and concluded that mr bettencourt wa portrayed therein even though she firmly denied it a a manipulated and weak woman with diminished mental faculty the court doe not see any serious reason to call into question the decision of the national court a regard the content of the article it certainly suggests that mr bettencourt in a diminished mental state wa manipulated by b a to b the court find that the domestic court both the urgent proceeding judge and the trial court took the view that the article wa not neutral or nuanced but rather slanted towards a demonstration of his guilt in breach of his right to be presumed innocent see paragraph and above the court note that under the headline exclusive the woman who accuse the article consists of three page exclusively made up of extract from statement that are unfavourable to b emanating from former employee of mr bettencourtγ conclusion a regard the content of the impugned article the court doe not see any reason to substitute it own opinion for that of the court of appeal and the court of cassationiii contribution of the impugned article to a publicinterest debate in the present case the court can not agree with the government submission that the impugned article represented no more than the publication of a banal news story without making any contribution to a debate in the general interest see paragraph above the article in le point were published in the context of proceeding which had begun in and had received wide medium coverage a pointed out by the tribunal de grande instance the proceeding implicated public figure whose renown in the social and political arena wa well established and the bettencourt affair already had a high profile in public opinion at the time of the publication see paragraph above moreover reiterating that the public have a legitimate interest in the provision and availability of information about criminal proceeding and that remark concerning the functioning of the judiciary relate to a matter of public interest see morice v france gc no april and bédat cited above see also recommendation rec cited above paragraph above the court observes on this point that the public interest in being informed about this case go well beyond the context of the family conflict between mr bettencourt and her daughter or the relation between the latter and b the court therefore find that the applicant offending remark which concerned public figure and the functioning of the judiciary were part of a debate in the general interest which went beyond satisfying the mere curiosity of a certain readership about an event or trial involving unknown party compare bédat cited above and and tourancheau and july cited above see also mutatis mutandis du roy and malaurie v france no echr x and dupuis and others v france no june the public interest in receiving information went beyond the context of the trial and that fact had to be taken into account when weighing in the balance the various interest involved the court observes that the firstinstance court in the proceeding on the merit took the view that the content of the article of december and february constituted information that could contribute to a debate in the general interest a it wa a criminal case with considerable financial repercussion and concerned public figure the other domestic court ruling on the merit and in urgent proceeding did not deny that the information in the impugned publication wa such a to contribute to a generalinterest debate they took the view however that this debate having regard to the provision of section of the act could be informed otherwise than by quoting from procedural document to which the reader would attach particular credibility and an undeniable evidential value in the court view the weighing in the balance of on the one hand the interest of mr bettencourt and b together with those of the proper administration of justice and on the other the alleged general interest justification relied upon by the applicant could have given rise to more explicit reasoning in the same way that the alleged breach of the right to private life wa itself dealt with see paragraph and above that being said the court can not infer from the decision in question that the national court failed to take into consideration the fact that the publication were capable of providing clarification for the benefit of the public debate and the public interest their dismissal of this aspect a insufficiently pertinent fell within their margin of appreciation see bédat cited above iv the influence of the impugned article on the criminal proceeding a regard the influence of the impugned article the court reiterates that it is important for journalist who write article on pending criminal proceeding not to reduce a person chance of having a fair trial which involves respecting the defendant right to be presumed innocent and not to undermine public confidence in the role played by the court in the administration of justice encompassing the opinionforming and decisionmaking process within the judiciary see tourancheau and july cited above and and bédat cited above in such matter a mere risk of influencing the subsequent proceeding may suffice and this risk must be assessed at the time when the authority take the relevant deterrent measure see bédat cited above α the article of december and february visàvis b the court observes that in the proceeding on the merit the firstinstance court found that the interest in informing the public about the bettencourt affair outweighed any other interest worthy of protection under section of the act and concerning the authority and impartiality of the judiciary under this provision the court of appeal however stated that the bias displayed by the article against b had reduced his chance of a fair trial and made it necessary for him to explain his position on prosecution evidence that had not yet been debated before a court of law that wa also the position of the urgent proceeding judge see paragraph above the court ha already indicated that in the present case the impugned article painted a negative picture of b based on information from procedural document reproduced verbatim in the court view the publication of the article on december the day before b appearance at the nanterre criminal court and on february two month before the hearing scheduled for april wa liable to heavily influence the outcome of the proceeding with potential repercussion on individual who might subsequently be called to give testimony in court or even on the judge hearing the case the court reiterates in this connection that the publication of a slanted article is capable of undermining the objectivity of the trial court irrespective of it composition see bédat cited above moreover while it is true that b had specific remedy at his disposal to secure respect for his right to be presumed innocent such a that provided for in article of the civil code which particularly concern the medium the court note that b case before the civil court wa declared admissible and that the incriminating effect of the publication wa emphasised by that court in conclusion the court doe not agree with the applicant that the extensive medium coverage of the case vindicated the verbatim publication of numerous and lengthy excerpt from procedural document given the complex issue before the court a regard both the vulnerability of mr bettencourt and the material element of the offence of undue influence with which b wa charged the publication of those document in the framework of biased article risked disrupting the proper conduct of the proceeding and jeopardising b right to a fair trial the court confirms in this connection that the ban provided for in section of the act is not general and absolute in nature and doe not totally restrict the right of the press to inform the public being temporary and limited see tourancheau and july cited above consequently it take the view that the applicant a medium professional were in a position to avoid such risk without affecting the substance of the information that they wished to impartβ the article of february visàvis mr bettencourt a regard the article of february visàvis mr bettencourt the court observes that the urgent proceeding brought by her led to an acknowledgment of the damage she had sustained in so far a the publication wa capable of contravening her right in portraying her prior to the examination of the criminal case in the nanterre criminal court a a manipulated and weak woman a portrayal which she denied see paragraph above a mr bettencourt had filed submission by way of voluntary intervention with in the alternative an application to join the criminal court proceeding a a civil party and in view of the content of the information conveyed to the reader the court acknowledges that the publication wa capable of having negative effect on the proper administration of justicev whether there wa a breach of privacy the court can not but note that in the course of the proceeding no breach of b privacy wa found by the domestic court b who wa very well known did not in fact claim such a breach in his legal action a to mr bettencourt the domestic court did not find any breach of her privacy on account of her situation which exposed her to public attention or of the potential interest of the public in reading about hervi whether the sanction wa proportionate in the present case a regard the proceeding brought by b the applicant were ordered in the urgent proceeding to pay an advance of eur and to publish a notice of the judgment and in the proceeding on the merit to pay eur in respect of the nonpecuniary damage with the publication of a further notice in the urgent proceeding brought by mr bettencourt the applicant were ordered to pay an advance of eur the court take the view that those sanction can not be deemed excessive or capable of having a chilling effect on the exercise of medium freedomvii conclusion the court concludes that the reason put forward by the domestic court to justify the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression a a result of the judgment against them were relevant and sufficient for the purpose of article in particular the interest of the applicant and that of the public in imparting and receiving information on the subject of a question in the general interest wa not such a to prevail over the consideration raised by the domestic court a to the consequence for the protection of the right of others and the proper administration of justice the judgment against the applicant met a sufficiently compelling social need to take precedence over the public interest in the freedom of the press and those judgment can not be deemed disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued there ha therefore been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in french and notified in writing on june pursuant to rule and of the rule of court milan blaško angelika nußberger deputy registrar president,,,
33,in and life in gilserberg she wa represented by m g pahl a lawyer practising in hamburg the government were represented by one of their agent m n wenzel of the federal ministry of justice and consumer protection the fact of the case may be summarised a follows background to the casethe applicant political activity from until early the applicant wa a member of the political party the republican die partei der republikaner the party is generally considered to be rightwing and ha been under scrutiny by the office for the protection of the constitution verfassungsschutzämter in various german länder it ha not however been declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court under article of the german basic law for earlier case concerning member of that party see otto v germany dec no november and erdel v germany dec no february the applicant sat on the schwalm eder district council kreistag and stood for election to both the federal parliament bundestag and to the parliament of the land of hesse landtag on behalf of that party in march the applicant wa elected to the district council on behalf of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance bürgerbündnis pro schwalm eder and served in that role until her resignation in late the domestic court established that several member of that alliance board a composed at that time had link with organisation of the extreme right see paragraph and below in addition to her membership in and activity on behalf of these party and organisation the applicant expressed herself publicly at political rally and in lecture and interview over the year the applicant employment a a teacher the applicant trained a a teacher for lower secondary school passing her first and second state exam in and she exercised this profession for limited period and at irregular interval in the academic year she worked at a public secondary school in eltville in the land of hesse on a fixedterm contract she received a positive appraisal report for that academic year and in the academic year she again worked at the same school on a fixedterm contract in a letter of march the competent authority terminated the applicant employment contract with immediate effect citing doubt a to her loyalty to the constitution verfassungstreue in early april the hesse ministry of culture notified all public education authority in hesse that the applicant employment contract had been terminated on the ground of significant doubt a to her loyalty to the constitution and asked to be notified immediately if the applicant applied for another post the applicant brought an action against the termination of her employment contract before the wiesbaden labour court those proceeding ended with a friendly settlement concluded on may which read the employment contract will be terminated upon expiry of the fixed term specified therein that is on july the applicant will remain entitled to remuneration until the termination date but will be released from her work duty the party hereby agree that an offer of employment issued in february will be deemed null and void the land against which the action wa brought hereby undertakes to delete from the personnel file any mention of the dismissal the applicant will receive a favourable appraisal report which specifies the date of termination a july that appraisal report wa issued on august and any mention of the dismissal wa deleted from her personnel file the applicant inclusion on the authority list in an email of may the hesse ministry of culture asked the darmstadt public education authority schulamt to ensure through the centralised office for the management of teaching personnel that the applicant would not be included on any shortlist of potential teacher for public school in hesse in late the hesse ministry of culture in cooperation with the decentralised hesse public education authority decided to set up a list containing information regarding teacher deemed unsuitable for reappointment to a teaching post at a school the list the list wa maintained by the centralised office for the management of teaching personnel in hesse and access wa restricted to ten individual working at that office a well a to two individual at each of the fifteen decentralised hesse public education authority in the event that they received a job application education authority in other german länder and private school in hesse did not have the right to inspect the list and it would have been unlawful to transmit any information in the list to them according to the notification by the hesse ministry of culture the fact that the name of a job applicant appeared on the list did not obviate the need to examine his or her suitability in each individual case public education authority in hesse seeking to recruit thus retained the discretion to make their own decision a to the suitability of a job applicant included on the list by a letter of december the applicant wa notified that her name had been included on the list the list entry concerning the applicant read noninclusion in the shortlist reason attributable to the person the proceeding in issue on december the applicant requested that her name and information about her be deleted from the list by a letter of january the competent authority rejected the applicant request the applicant brought an action which in a judgment of august the darmstadt administrative court dismissed a illfounded finding that the applicant wa not entitled to have her name deleted from the list her inclusion and retention on the list and the processing of the information relating to her had a legal basis in section of the hesse data protection act in conjunction with section d and g of the hesse civil servant act see paragraph below the provision of the latter act applying mutatis mutandis to state employee who were not civil servant there wa sufficient evidence both at the time of her inclusion on the list and at the time of the administrative court judgment that the applicant wa not committed to the free democratic constitutional order freiheitlichdemokratische grundordnung in every aspect of her conduct contrary to the requirement of section second sentence of the collective agreement for public service in hesse tarifvertrag für den öffentlichen dienst de landes hessen see paragraph below the administrative court found that the respondent authority had acted within it margin of appreciation when it had concluded that there were serious doubt a to the applicant loyalty to the constitution and that she wa unsuitable to work a a teacher at a public school in hesse indeed it could not be taken for granted that the applicant would uphold the free democratic constitutional order at all time or that she would convey the basic value and principle of the constitution to her pupil in a credible manner observing that political engagement for an organisation that wa hostile to the constitution could be a relevant factor even if the organisation concerned had not been declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court under article of the basic law the administrative court considered that the applicant had been an active member of the republican from to early and had represented that party a a member of the schwalm eder district council and a a candidate in election at both the federal and land level this membership and these activity in the republican a party in respect of which there were manifold indication that it wa not committed to protecting in particular the dignity of foreigner and asylumseekers living in germany could serve a a first indication that there might be doubt a to the applicant loyalty to the constitution her letter of january to the party hesse leadership in which she had declared that she wa ending her party membership reinforced these doubt her primary motivation for her withdrawal from the party had been that she did not share the concern expressed by the party leadership about cooperation with member of the national democratic party of germany nationaldemokratische partei deutschland npd who had stood for election to the district council a part of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance in that letter the applicant had displayed an attitude that wa very critical of the german state a evidenced by her statement that there wa no risk of that alliance abolishing the free democratic constitutional order a such order had ceased to exist a long time ago and that she would make every effort to reinstate a free order deliberately omitting the word democratic her activity on behalf of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance were an important element for assessing the question of doubt a to her loyalty to the constitution several member of that alliance and in particular the member of it board including fr had link to extremeright organisation notably to the npd and neo nazi group and had become known for their extremist opinion the applicant could not successfully claim that the opinion of the alliance other member could not be attributed to her given that she had chosen to run for the march election to the district council and to serve a a member of the district council on behalf of that alliance until her resignation in late doubt a to the applicant loyalty to the constitution also followed from her appearance at political rally of inter alia a youth organisation of the extreme right and her interview with the npd magazine die deutsche stimme german voice she had engaged in such activity in but also a late a april when she had spoken at a rally of the russian german conservative stating that sixty year after the war we still bow to what the victor decreed and accept halftruths and lie about our own people her appearance at event of the silesian youth thuringia or the young witikons group were similarly characterised by aggressiveness towards state institution while she could legitimately object to kin liability in respect of the political view of her husband who had been described a an american neo nazi previously belonging to an important extremeright organisation in the united state of america and who had served a the district chairman of the npd since the similarity in political view wa evident from the fact that four member of the family including the applicant had run a candidate for the district council election in on behalf of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance the applicant had never distanced herself from her past political activity but had merely declared that she did not intend to be politically active in the future the administrative court considered that at the time of it judgment this wa insufficient to dispel the doubt for the purpose of a forwardlooking assessment a to her loyalty to the constitution which had justifiably arisen following year of political activity she could legitimately be expected to explicitly express her commitment to the free democratic constitutional order and to declare that she did not support movement pursuing contrary aim or in the alternative that she had turned away from such movement after having previously supported them however rather than doing so the applicant had defended her activity and merely stated that she did not pursue aim that were hostile to the constitution observing that her retention on the list meant that the applicant for the time being de facto had no possibility of being hired a a teacher at a public school in hesse the administrative court considered that this did not constitute an unjustified interference with her freedom of profession berufsfreiheit under article of the basic law in view of the importance of protecting the constitutional order and the risk that a teacher who opposed that order could abuse his or her role of educating the child entrusted to him or her the authority were allowed to question the teacher loyalty to the constitution even if there had not yet been any workrelated reproach application by the applicant for a teaching post at private school in hesse or at school in other german länder were not futile a access to the list wa limited to the hesse authority and could not be transmitted to other authority for reason of data protection lastly the applicant inclusion on the list wa not in conflict with the friendly settlement concluded in see paragraph above a that did not prevent the authority from continuing to doubt the applicant loyalty to the constitution and seeking to prevent her reappointment a a teacher at a public school in hesse on september the applicant requested leave to appeal the administrative court judgment submitting that she wa not unsuitable to work a a teacher and that the judgment had breached her freedom of opinion under article of the basic law and her freedom of profession under article of the basic law she argued that not a single school in germany would hire her a a result of her inclusion on the list which had a stigmatising effect she had always strictly separated her political activity and her work a a teacher and there had never been any detrimental effect on her work a a teacher a also evidenced by the positive appraisal report she had received her previous membership in and activity on behalf of the republican were not in themselves sufficient to question her loyalty to the constitution nor did these activity or those on behalf of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance render her unsuitable to work a a teacher political view held by other member of that alliance could not be attributed to her a a member of the district council from which she had resigned in late she had never made any statement that were hostile to the constitution xenophobic or extremist she did not intend to pursue any political activity in the future neither the russian german conservative nor the silesian youth thuringia or the young witikons were deemed to be hostile to the constitution or being monitored for that reason reference to her husband were inadmissible she could not be required to distance herself from her prior political activity also bearing in mind that she did not aim to become a civil servant and that a lesser degree of loyalty wa required from public employee who were not civil servant lastly her retention on the list wa in breach of the friendly settlement reached in in which the authority had undertaken to remove the dismissal notice from her personnel file this also meant that doubt a to her loyalty to the constitution could not be based on her past political activity by an order of september the hesse administrative court of appeal dismissed the applicant request for leave to appeal a illfounded finding that there were no serious doubt a to the correctness of the administrative court judgment a regard the compatibility of the impugned measure with the applicant freedom of profession under article of the basic law the court considered that the applicant wa unsuitable for a teaching post at a public school in hesse and that the measure which aimed to prevent her reappointment to such a post wa proportionate in view of the public interest at stake it wa true that not all employee working in public service arbeitnehmer im öffentlichen dienst were per se subject to an enhanced obligation of loyalty to the constitution comparable to the one imposed on civil servant beamte rather the extent of their obligation of loyalty depended on their position and the task they performed which meant that teacher were subject to an enhanced duty of political loyalty which wa equivalent or came close to the one placed on teacher who were civil servant teacher had to teach the child entrusted to them in a credible manner about the basic value of the constitution child and adolescent in public school should recognise that freedom democracy and the rule of law were value worth upholding a teacher who did not relate positively to the basic value and principle of the constitution wa unable to convince his or her pupil that democracy wa worth defending moreover there wa a risk that such a teacher would sway his or her student against the basic value of the constitution pupil were wholly at the mercy of the teacher influence the role played by teacher wa therefore one of enormous significance from a publicpolicy perspective the administrative court of appeal added that standard differed depending on whether the matter concerned the termination of an existing employment contract or a in the present case potential reappointment to a post whereas general doubt a to the individual loyalty to the constitution were not sufficient to justify the termination of an existing employment contract such general doubt were sufficient to justify the decision not to recruit an individual with the employer enjoying a margin of appreciation in the applicant case there were sufficient general doubt a to her loyalty to the constitution the existence of workrelated reproach or detrimental effect on her work a a result of her political activity wa therefore not required and the applicant submission a to her positive appraisal report and her separation of professional and political activity were beside the point in respect of the existence of such general doubt a to the applicant loyalty to the constitution and her challenge of that assessment the administrative court of appeal in essence repeated the ground given by the administrative court see paragraph above the administrative court of appeal added that the pro schwalm eder civic alliance had been deemed hostile to the constitution and that the applicant had voluntarily chosen to run a the alliance top candidate in the election to the district council a such she could not legitimately avoid being identified with the political aim of the alliance other member and candidate it also reiterated that membership in and activity on behalf of party and organisation that were hostile to the constitution such a the one with or on behalf of which the applicant had voluntarily and actively engaged wa a relevant aspect in the assessment of doubt a to loyalty to the constitution in the context of the person potential employment even if the respective party or organisation had not been declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court under article of the basic law having regard to the foregoing and to the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the land in question in relation to applicant for employment the administrative court of appeal concluded that there were objective ground for that land to seek to prevent the applicant employment a a teacher at a public school in hesse in these circumstance including the applicant on the list wa not disproportionate to the aim pursued the applicant inclusion on the list provided any of the decentralised public education authority with an effective opportunity to examine existing reservation a to the applicant appointment in a potential future recruitment procedure no more lenient equally suitable measure could be discerned access to the list wa heavily restricted which limited the severity of the interference with the applicant right access wa restricted to ten individual within the centralised office for the management of teaching personnel in the land of hesse which administered the list a well a to two individual at each of the decentralised public education authority in hesse the list wa for internal use only and the information contained therein wa not transmitted beyond the said authority in hesse notably neither private school in hesse nor authority in other länder had a right to inspect the list the impact of the applicant inclusion and retention on the list wa therefore limited to making it more difficult or preventing her appointment at a public school in hesse it did not negatively affect the applicant chance of employment at public school in other länder or at private school in hesse there wa no reason to believe that her job application at a private school in hesse and at a public school in another land had been unsuccessful because of her inclusion on the list contrary to what she had alleged given that the relevant employer did not have access to it it wa much more likely that her application had been unsuccessful for other reason or that her political activity and public appearance had led to her being publicly known in so far a the applicant had invoked the friendly settlement of may that agreement did not feature any undertaking in respect of a future reappointment of the applicant at a public school in hesse nor an undertaking that the circumstance which had led to the applicant dismissal would not be considered in connection with her potential reappointment lastly even assuming that the impugned measure constituted an interference with the applicant right to freedom of opinion under article of the basic law such interference wa not disproportionate in view of the enormous importance of and public interest in educating child in a credible manner about the basic value of the constitution on october the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint which the federal constitutional court decided not to accept for adjudication without providing reason decision no bv r of may the decision wa served on the applicant on june the applicant political activity after in their observation the government submitted that the applicant had continued to engage in political activity for the extreme right contrary to what she had submitted before the domestic court by way of example they referred to a lecture given in barcelona in entitled inge godenau la democracia manipulada during the talk a flag of the npd had been on display and a member of the audience had been wearing a tshirt with a slightly modified swastika the promotional material for the event had described the applicant a belonging to a family of militant and founding member of the npd the government pointed out that a simple internet search of the applicant name brought up a large number of online post letter and speech expressing extremist opinion some of which could engage criminal liability with her contribution covering topic such a her nonrecognition of poland national border her criticism of the presentation of historical event in school textbook and allegation that the press wa lying the government submitted example of the applicant statement to the court including the following id be remiss to end my post without referring to the brutal regime which allegedly murdered million of jew and wa responsible for million more death during the second world war researcher do not by any mean share a single opinion a regard the former and a regard the latter it is now commonly accepted that germany neither planned nor wanted to go to war another statement by the applicant wa to the effect that germany had no constitution since a portion of the population remained under polish administration the opinion of the entire german people on the matter had not been sought the applicant did not dispute that she had made those statement relevant legal framework and practice the relevant provision of the basic law grundgesetz read a follows article everyone shall have the right freely to express and disseminate

concept of a free democratic constitutional order within the meaning of the basic law according to the wellestablished caselaw of the domestic court the suitability for employment in public service within the meaning of article of the basic law entail a duty of loyalty to the constitution see for example federal labour court no azr judgment of may at para juris with further reference state employee with civil servant status are subject to an enhanced duty of loyalty ibid at para with further reference the extent of the duty of loyalty owed by state employee employed under privatelaw

applicant complained about the refusal to delete her name from the information list of teacher deemed unsuitable for reappointment to a teaching post by the hesse public education authority she relied on article which read a follows article everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility incompatibility ratione materiae the government argued that the complaint wa incompatible ratione materiae with article of the convention a it concerned in essence the right to recruitment to the civil service according to the wellestablished caselaw of the court the right to recruitment to civil service had deliberately been omitted from the convention and a such the refusal to appoint a person a a civil servant could not provide the basis for a complaint under the convention they referred to inter alia glasenapp v germany august series a no wille v liechtenstein gc no echr vii and otto v germany dec no november the circumstance of the present case were distinct from those in wille in that case the president of the liechtenstein administrative court had been reprimanded for opinion he had expressed in the course of the performance of his duty the possibility of appointment to another office had not formed the subject of the dispute by contrast the action taken by the authority in the present case had not related to the ongoing employment of a civil servant instead the proceeding had concerned a measure the inclusion on a list of person deemed unsuitable for appointment to a teaching post which affected only individual who had already left the public service and which would make their recruitment more difficult if they applied for position at public school in the future the applicant earlier dismissal in respect of which a friendly settlement had been reached in the proceeding before the wiesbaden labour court wa not the subject matter of the present case distinguishing it from that in vogt v germany september series a no the applicant submitted that the refusal to delete her name from the list in issue had constituted a disproportionate interference with her right under article of the convention the court reiterates that the refusal to appoint a person a a public servant can not a such provide the basis for a complaint under the convention see cimperšek v slovenia no june with further reference however in a recent case the court putting the scope of the measure in the context of the fact of the case and the relevant legislation held that the refusal to appoint an applicant who had succeeded in the relevant examination to a public service post because of statement he had made wa a measure that essentially related to freedom of expression and not access to public service ibid while the applicant inclusion and retention on the list in issue undoubtedly aimed to prevent her appointment to a teaching post at a public school in hesse the subject matter of the present case is not whether the applicant had a right to be recruited to public service and she did not complain about the authority refusal to appoint her a a teacher rather the matter before the court is the refusal to delete her name from the list of teacher deemed unsuitable for reappointment to a teaching post maintained by the hesse authority which list pursued the purpose of providing information to any of the decentralised public education authority in hesse that may receive a job application by the applicant however any such authority retained a discretion whether to recruit the applicant or not see paragraph above it is not disputed that the applicant wa included on that list because of the opinion she had expressed and the political activity she had engaged in the court can accept that this measure essentially related to freedom of expression and that article of the convention is applicable to the applicant complaint see mutatis mutandis cimperšek cited above et seq it follows that the government objection a to the applicability of article of the convention must be dismissed at the same time the court point out that it doe not follow from the applicability ratione materiae of article of the convention that the applicant had a right to be appointed to a teaching post at a public school in hesse incompatibility ratione persona the government maintained that the applicant could not claim to be a victim of a convention violation for the purpose of article of the convention her inclusion on the list viewed in isolation had not directly affected the applicant she would only be directly affected by her inclusion in the list if she applied for a teaching post at a public school in hesse and her application wa rejected because of her inclusion on the list the applicant had made a general statement that she had not been appointed to a teaching post by any public or private school in hesse or other german länder a a result of her inclusion on the list but she had not submitted that any application she had made at a school in hesse had been unsuccessful for that reason while she had claimed that her application at a private school in north rhine westphalia had been unsuccessful it had been ruled out that the rejection of her application had been causally linked to her inclusion on the list since a private school in another land had no right to inspect that list it wa more likely that the private school concerned had learned about the applicant political view from the internet where many statement by the applicant and information about her activity were available a evidenced by the lecture she had organised in barcelona in the inclusion on the list in question had not deterred the applicant from continuing her political activity and expressing her view which meant that the impugned measure had not had a chilling effect on her they referred to petropavlovskis v latvia no echr the applicant did not specifically comment on this aspect the court reiterates that in order to lodge an application in accordance with article of the convention an individual must be able to show that he or she wa directly affected by the measure complained of see akbay and others v germany no and others october with further reference in the present case the administrative court did not declare the applicant action concerning the authority refusal to delete her name from the list inadmissible it being noted that claiming to be directly affected in one right by the administrative act or refusal is an admissibility requirement for action before administrative court under german law what is more the domestic court considered that her inclusion and retention on that list had at least made her appointment at a public school in hesse considerably more difficult see paragraph and above in these circumstance and taking into account that the very purpose of the applicant inclusion and retention on the list wa to prevent her reappointment to a teaching post at a public school in hesse it would be overly formalistic to require the applicant to apply for such a post first and be rejected or to consider that she wa not directly affected for the purpose of article of the convention by the refusal to delete her name from the list it follows that the government objection must be dismissed conclusion the court note that this complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merit the party submissionsa the applicant the applicant relying on vogt cited above submitted that her inclusion on and refusal to delete her information from the list a measure which had been based on the opinion she had expressed a well a her membership in and activity on behalf of certain political party and association had breached her right under article of the convention while she had been critical of certain aspect of the political situation in germany such a the significant power of the medium and the government asylum policy the authority conclusion that she had been hostile to the constitution wa untenable it had to be possible to express legitimate criticism and she had no reason to distance herself from the opinion she had expressed no specific evidence of her alleged hostility to the constitution had ever been presented the allegation against her had been unsubstantiated based on wrongful assumption and mostly referred to the association she had been part of while it wa true that certain member of the republican were considered a being hostile to the constitution the party had not been banned and moreover the applicant had left the party a a member of the district council she had never made any statement that were hostile to the constitution extremist or xenophobic nor had she acted in such a manner it wa true that she had been politically active but being politically active wa a protected fundamental right it wa unjust that citizen were invited to engage politically but had their livelihood destroyed if their political engagement did not take the desired form during her study she had never been told that working a a teacher would entail a restriction of her fundamental right the applicant submitted that it wa incorrect that fr an individual who had become known for his extremist opinion wa a member of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance in any event she had resigned a a member of the district council in and had not been politically active since in response to the government observation in which they referred to her activity after the applicant acknowledged that she had attended a conference in barcelona in but disputed that she had organised it she had no knowledge of the picture of that conference on the internet it wa also untrue that she gave regular interview to die deutsche stimme she had given only one interview after being asked to do so following her dismissal similarly the authority conclusion that she wa unsuitable for a teaching post wa untenable the school where she had worked from to wa located some kilometre away from the schwalm eder district and at that school it had not been known that she had been a member of the district council in the latter location a a teacher she had always paid attention to expressing herself in a neutral and matteroffact manner she had never expressed her opinion on politics there had never been any reproach of her professional conduct or performance indeed she had received very positive appraisal report and the management of the school had offered her a permanent position her dismissal had been unjustified and had been withdrawn following the friendly settlement before the labour court and wa thus null and void she had had no choice but to agree to that friendly settlement a she had found herself in a financially precarious situation in sum none of the requirement for inclusion in the list either to have been dismissed from a teaching post with immediate effect or professional deficiency applied to her the retention of her name on the list made it impossible for her to work a a teacher no school wa going to hire her ever since her inclusion on the list all her application for teaching post had been unsuccessful including at private school or at public school in other german länder she had been unemployed and living off welfare benefit ever sinceb the government even assuming that there had been an interference with the applicant article right the government maintained that it had been justified state enjoyed a very broad margin of appreciation in respect of civil service in germany political activity wa allowed up to the limit of conduct engaging criminal liability but civil servant and state employee had a duty of loyalty to the constitution the degree of which depended on their particular function school attendance wa compulsory in germany and teacher thus had a vital role to play by teaching their pupil about the foundation of germany democratic system and the basic value of the constitution they stood a guarantor for living together in a free and democratic state the duty of loyalty imposed upon teacher which entailed restriction of their freedom of expression a fact which individual were aware of when choosing the profession constituted a central pillar of germany defensive democracy and wa of vital importance from a publicpolicy perspective teacher who had reservation about or openly opposed the democratic system would be constrained in their ability to teach pupil that freedom democracy and the rule of law were value worth defending reiterating the essence of the domestic court assessment a to the existence of doubt a to the applicant loyalty to the constitution notably her political activity and statement in their entirety the government explained that the threshold for declaring a political party unconstitutional under article of the basic law wa high and that a party that wa hostile to the constitution would therefore not necessarily be declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court in the light of the reaffirmation of the applicant view and idea in her observation in the proceeding before the court it wa inconceivable that she would successfully be able to convey the basic value of the german constitution to pupil the government emphasised that the applicant appeared to have acknowledged that her initial claim that she had not been politically active since had been incorrect in so far a there wa a dispute a to the fact relating to activity on behalf of certain organisation and group the government noted that in it judgment the administrative court had established that fr an individual who had become known for his extremist opinion had been a member of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance a it had done in respect of the applicant appearance at political rally and her role a an interviewee a regard her participation in the conference in barcelona the government pointed out that it advertisement had borne her name in the title and that any potential lack of knowledge a to any documentation of her lecture or picture taken did not take away from the fact that she had participated in it she had also not distanced herself from that fact or the view she had expressed there she had described herself a a victim of the system because her employment contract had been terminated and stated that germany democratic system wa riddled with hypocrisy and that the country wa in the process of de germanisation if anything the view she expressed had over time become more radical rather than more moderate importantly the applicant political view and her work a a teacher were linked contrary to what she had submitted by way of example the government referred to the speech she had given at the rally held by the russian german conservative in april which had focused on a description of historical event in a school textbook a well a the part of her speech cited by the domestic court see paragraph above the applicant had also stated and so today we are demonstrating not only against the lie in that school textbook but also and in particular against the undemocratic rabblerousing of the medium there are three thing you need to know about the press radio and television today the first is that they lie the second is that they lie and the third is that if they do tell the truth they tell only half the truth the last is the worst of all three because a complete lie is easier to detect than a halftruth at an earlier rally of the russian german conservative in april she had stated our history textbook are written from the perspective of the winner and thats why one of them contains statement about the russian german which are untrue and thats why were protesting here today we must not stand by and watch the victim of bolshevik violence be turned into perpetrator those of u gathered here today believe in the truth we are calling for lie about historical fact to be removed from school textbook our child must not be told lie about their grandfather and greatgrandfathers the time ha come to put an end to the selfdebasement of our people we are calling for genuine freedom of opinion and not simply the acceptance of only one monolithic and politically correct opinion in most german länder there were central recruitment agency which were able to consult the personnel record of individual applying to work a a teacher and to find out whether any of their previous contract of employment had been terminated on ground of unsuitability in hesse teacher at public school were at least in some case appointed on a decentralised basis by the relevant public education authority the list in issue pursued the aim of avoiding that individual whose prior employment a a teacher had been terminated because they had been found unsuitable such a the applicant be recruited by a decentralised public education authority which wa unaware of those fact indeed the applicant political activity had not been known at the time of her recruitment to the post from which she had subsequently been dismissed a soon a they had become known she had been dismissed in the friendly settlement concluded in the authority had not undertaken to refrain from including the applicant name on an information list or from taking into account the fact that had led to her dismissal when deciding whether to appoint her to another teaching post inclusion and retention on the list did not constitute a severe interference access to the list wa heavily restricted among hesse public education authority and neither public school in other german länder nor private school in hesse had access to the list or to the information contained therein inclusion on the list did not entail a ban on working a a teacher in the event of the applicant applying for a teaching post at a public school in hesse an assessment of her suitability would have to be carried out and the school concerned remained free to recruit the applicant regardless of her inclusion on the list moreover deletion from the list could be requested on the basis of a change in the relevant circumstance the applicant had simply not submitted any evidence concerning a change in such circumstance lastly a the applicant wa a french language teacher and had also worked a an english language teacher her qualification would allow her to work at language school the court assessment having regard to it consideration in respect of the applicability of article of the convention see paragraph above the court find that the refusal to delete the applicant name from the list interfered with her right under article of the convention it follows that the court need to examine whether the interference wa justified in accordance with article of the convention that is whether it wa prescribed by law whether it pursued one or more of the legitimate aim set out in that paragraph and whether it wa necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve those aim the inclusion and retention of the applicant name on the list wa based on section of the hesse data protection act in conjunction with section d and g of the hesse civil servant act see paragraph above and served to inform future decision by the relevant hesse public education authority should the applicant apply for a job at a public school in hesse the performance of such check concerning the suitability for employment in public service wa based on article of the basic law and section of the collective agreement for public service in hesse see paragraph above noting that in accordance with the caselaw of the domestic court such suitability entailed a duty of loyalty to the constitution see paragraph above and that the applicant name wa retained on the list in question precisely because of doubt a to such loyalty on her part and that she had been informed about her inclusion on the list without delay the court considers that the impugned measure wa prescribed by law the court ha already recognised in earlier case that the duty of loyalty to the constitution imposed on civil servant and public employee under german law wa an expression of a democracy capable of defending itself and that restriction on the freedom of expression of teacher deriving from that duty of loyalty pursued legitimate aim under article of the convention notably the prevention of disorder and the protection of the right of others see vogt cited above and volkmer v germany dec no november it considers that this applies to the applicant inclusion and retention on the list which pursed the purpose of serving a a basis for a decision on her potential application for a job at public school in hesse it being noted that teacher at public school may be appointed by any of the decentralised hesse public education authority concerning a teacher who wa a civil servant under german law the court considered that when determining whether a fair balance ha been struck between the fundamental right of the individual to freedom of expression and the legitimate aim of a democratic state in ensuring that it civil service properly furthered the purpose enumerated in article of the convention whenever civil servant right to freedom of expression wa in issue the duty and responsibility referred to in article of the convention assumed a special significance which justified leaving to the national authority a certain margin of appreciation in determining whether the impugned interference wa proportionate to the above aim see vogt cited above in subsequent case concerning teacher the court did not delve into the question whether their status under the relevant domestic law wa that of civil servant or other public employee and instead focused on their role a teacher being a symbol of authority for their pupil in the field of education and reiterated that the particular duty and responsibility incumbent on them also applied to a certain extent to their activity outside school see mahi v belgium dec no july with further reference the court see no reason to depart from this approach in the present case and dismisses a irrelevant the applicant submission that she wa not and did not aspire to become a civil servant within the meaning of domestic law it note the approach taken by the domestic court according to which a far a public employee were concerned the decisive element for the duty of loyalty to the constitution and the degree of loyalty owed wa the role and function exercised by the individual and that a high degree of such loyalty wa owed by teacher which wa equivalent or came close to that owed by civil servant in this connection the court emphasis the enormous importance from a publicpolicy perspective of teaching and educating child in a credible manner about freedom democracy human right and the rule of law a in vogt cited above it is undisputed that the applicant work a a teacher had been wholly satisfactory and there were no indication that she had sought to take advantage of her position to indoctrinate or exert improper influence on her pupil during lesson however in vogt there wa no evidence that the applicant had actually made statement that were hostile to the constitution or had personally adopted such a stance the only criticism retained against her had concerned her active membership of and the post held in a political party and her candidature in the election for a land parliament cited above by contrast in the present case the domestic authority did not merely rely on the applicant active membership in the republican from to and the fact that she had sat on the district council and stood a a candidate in several election for that party rather they relied heavily on the applicant additional activity and statement to conclude that there were doubt a to her loyalty to the constitution they took into consideration inter alia the reason the applicant had given for leaving the republican that is that she did not share the concern expressed by the party leadership about a cooperation with member of the npd who were part of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance and her statement that there wa no risk of that alliance abolishing the free democratic constitutional order a such order had ceased to exist a long time ago and that she would make every effort to reinstate a free order deliberately omitting the word democratic see paragraph and above the domestic court also took into consideration the applicant subsequent membership of and active engagement on behalf of that alliance which had been deemed to be hostile to the constitution see paragraph and above a well a statement she had made at political rally see paragraph and above and the fact that she had not distanced herself from her activity see paragraph and above the court is therefore satisfied that the domestic court based their conclusion that there were doubt a to the applicant loyalty to the constitution on a wellreasoned assessment of the relevant fact it note that the additional submission made by the government in their observation both about the link between the applicant statement and her work a a teacher see paragraph above and her continued public statement in the year after her resignation from the district council in late see paragraph above in so far a they are uncontested see paragraph and above reinforce the conclusion reached by the domestic court another significant difference between the present case and that in vogt are the nature and consequence of the impugned measure the applicant in vogt had been dismissed from her post which the court considered a a very severe measure inter alia because of the effect it had on her reputation cited above what is in issue in the present case by contrast is not the applicant dismissal but rather her inclusion and retention on an internal list of teacher deemed unsuitable for future reappointment to a teaching post which wa maintained by the authority a very limited number of public official in hesse had access to this list and her inclusion and retention on it which wa not known or visible to the public can not be said to have had a severe negative effect on her reputation what is more the applicant dismissal in vogt which terminated with immediate effect her existing employment a a civil servant which wa of an indefinite duration under the relevant domestic law constituted a severe interference with her existing right in the present case by contrast the applicant wa not employed at the time her name wa included on the list and none of her existing position or right were interfered with rather her inclusion and retention on the list pursued the aim of preventing her future appointment to a teaching post at a public school in hesse in this respect it constitutes an important element of proportionality that the relevant decentralised public education authority in hesse were not prevented from recruiting the applicant to a teaching post and were obliged to examine her suitability in the event of receiving a job application by the applicant see paragraph and above moreover neither public school in any of the other german länder nor private school in hesse had access to the list or the information contained therein and consequently the applicant inclusion and retention on the list could not possibly prevent her appointment to or negatively affect her application for a teaching post at a public school in another land or at a private school in hesse a established by the domestic court see paragraph and above lastly even though the domestic court dismissed the applicant request to have her name deleted from the list finding that there continued to be ground for doubting her loyalty to the constitution and for retaining her name on the list the possibility for the applicant to request such deletion at any point in time and to obtain a comprehensive judicial review a to the existence at the time of the domestic court assessment of doubt concerning her political loyalty constitutes an important procedural safeguard which is a factor to be taken into account in the proportionality assessment see baka v hungary gc no june having regard to the foregoing consideration the court concludes that the domestic authority adduced relevant and sufficient reason and did not overstep their margin of appreciation the interference with the applicant freedom of expression wa therefore proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and wa thus necessary in a democratic society there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention alleged violation of article and of the convention the applicant also relied on article and of the convention to complain about the same measure alleging that she had been discriminated against because of her political view and that a double standard wa applied depending on which end of the political spectrum teacher belonged to having regard to the fact of the case and the party submission which essentially referred to the argument they had made in respect of article it finding under that latter provision and the parallel it ha drawn in it assessment under article and in earlier case concerning the dismissal of teacher see for example volkmer cited above the court considers that it ha examined the main legal question raised in the present application and that there is thus no need to give a separate ruling on the remaining complaint see mutatis mutandis centre for legal resource on behalf of valentin câmpeanu v romania gc no echr for these reason the court unanimouslydeclares the complaint under article of the convention admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention hold that there is no need to examine separately the admissibility and merit of the applicant complaint under article and of the convention done in english and notified in writing on november pursuant to rule and of the rule of court ilse freiwirth gabriele kucsko stadlmayer deputy registrar president,,,
34,the applicant wa born in and life in pirna the applicant had been employed a head of the subdivision in charge of sanctioning misuse of housing property zweckentfremdung in the housing office of the municipality of dresden since on december a meeting of the staff of the housing office took place in the presence of the deputy mayor for economy and housing w an elected official who inter alia governed the housing office and of a number of staff and trade union representative following a short address on the issue of the expiry of the regulation on misuse of housing property by december given by w the applicant took the floor and accused w of having committed perversion of justice rechtsbeugung by ordering the issue of an unlawful demolition permit for a block of flat in on december the applicant head of division requested the applicant to substantiate his allegation in writing on december the applicant submitted several page of written comment in which he repeated several time using bold character his allegation that w had committed perversion of justice by ordering the issue of a demolition permit in without at the same time imposing compensation payment for the loss of housing space caused by the demolition according to the applicant w had ruthlessly pursued politicoeconomic interest he further submitted that all staff member of his subdivision considered that w had deliberately discredited their work furthermore w had unlawfully attempted to dissolve the subdivision thus putting at risk it staff employment the statement made by w during the staff meeting had been degrading and cynical and had contained halftruths and lie w had not assumed any personal responsibility and did not show any concern for finding a socially acceptable solution to the problem arising from the dissolution of the subdivision by letter of march the municipality of dresden dismissed the applicant with effect from june the dismissal wa primarily based on the applicant statement during the staff meeting according to the letter of dismissal the applicant accusation against w had been unjustified by making these accusation in front of a large number of staff member and representative of the staff committee and of the trade union the applicant had damaged his superior reputation and thus irrevocably destroyed the mutual trust which wa necessary for effective cooperation it wa further observed that the applicant had not availed himself of the possibility of submitting his concern to his superior or to the mayor finally it wa noted that the applicant had been reprimanded for disloyal conduct on two previous occasion on july a local newspaper published a letter to the editor in which the applicant expressed the opinion that the deputy mayor w lacked any competence for resolving problem relating to housing issue by judgment of may the dresden labour court arbeitsgericht established that the employment contract had not been terminated by the dismissal since this could not be justified under section of the unfair dismissal act kündigungsschutzgesetz see relevant domestic law below the labour court did not find it necessary to decide whether the applicant allegation had been correct a they were in any event covered by the applicant right to freedom of expression on january the saxon labour court of appeal landesarbeitsgericht dismissed the appeal lodged by the municipality of dresden on november the federal labour court bundesarbeitsgericht upon the municipality appeal on point of law quashed the judgment of january and remitted the case to the labour court of appeal no azr under the caselaw of the federal labour court gross insult directed against the employer or the employer representative which constituted a serious violation of the concerned person honour could justify dismissal on ground relating to the employee conduct in order to establish the seriousness of the violation of honour it had to be established whether the applicant allegation were based on objective fact account also had to be taken of whether the criticism had been made among staff member or whether other person had been present finally it had to be considered that employee of the public service had to respect specific obligation under their code of conduct the federal labour court confirmed that the right to freedom of expression always had to be taken into account when assessing inappropriate language in a workplace context and that the applicant allegation fell within the scope of his right to freedom of expression accordingly the court had to weigh this right against the protected legal interest with which there had been an interference the federal labour court considered that the court of appeal when weighing the competing interest had failed to establish correctly the seriousness of the applicant allegation and of the violation of the deputy mayor personality right under the criminal code perversion of justice wa a crime subject to up to five year imprisonment in case of a criminal conviction under this provision a deputy mayor would automatically lose his office the conduct of a public service employee had to be measured against a stricter yardstick than that of an employee in the private sector in particular the employee wa under an obligation to behave in such a way a not to interfere with his public employer reputation under the professional code of conduct the employee had to exercise special restraint when openly criticising a superior decision a public allegation of perversion of justice directed against a superior in particular if it wa unfounded very seriously violated the superior personality right and interfered a a rule with the employee professional duty accordingly in order duly to weigh the competing interest in the light of the right to freedom of expression the court of appeal would have to examine whether the applicant allegation had been justified or not it had further to be taken into account that the allegation had been made during a staff meeting while it wa true that criticism made in this context could occasionally be exaggerated or polemic without giving the employer a ground for dismissal this right wa limited by the obligation not to disturb peace in the office it had to be taken into account in the applicant favour that the staff meeting concerned the suppression of the applicant field of work and that the atmosphere had been rather tense however this did not justify neglecting the fact that the allegation of perversion of justice did not concern the subject matter of the staff meeting but a single incident which dated back several year and had not been mentioned by the applicant since the applicant did not make use of the possibility of informing the mayor about his legal concern regarding the deputy mayor decision at the time of the staff meeting the decision dated back such a long time that an attempt to put the decision into question must have lacked the prospect of success accordingly it appeared that the applicant statement wa rather aimed at attacking the deputy mayor it had also to be taken into account that the statement wa made in the presence of person who were not necessarily bound by confidentiality accordingly there wa the risk that the applicant allegation would leak out of this close circle and be made known to a wider public the federal labour court finally observed that the applicant statement had to be seen in the wider context of his conduct and that the applicant had further exacerbated the conflict by the content of his written comment on november the saxon labour court of appeal quashed the judgment of the labour court dated may and dismissed the applicant action the labour court of appeal considered that the applicant dismissal had been justified because the applicant in his statement at the staff meeting and in his subsequent written submission had seriously insulted and slandered the deputy mayor by accusing him of perversion of justice based on a detailed examination of the factual and legal situation in the labour court of appeal considered that the decision taken by the deputy mayor at that time had been lawful the applicant written submission of december demonstrated that he wa not willing to accept and implement politically legitimate decision if they concerned sanction for misuse of property by house owner the content of the letter to the editor see paragraph above contained value judgment which did not amount to insult however the deputy mayor could not be expected to maintain daily cooperation with the applicant after reading this letter in which he had been described a incompetent the labour court of appeal further observed that the applicant had not revised his opinion during the proceeding the labour court of appeal further considered that the employer did not have any milder mean at it disposal in particular it would not have been sufficient to reprimand the applicant and to transfer him to another working position the court observed that the applicant wa currently working in the public procurement office and that there wa no negative information about his conduct this wa temporary employment which the applicant had obtained by court order in separate proceeding the applicant had expressed his readiness to accept employment even at a lower level however the labour court of appeal considered that the applicant would not have changed his attitude without his dismissal from office the municipality could reasonably expect that the applicant would have carried on with his selfrighteous attitude if he had not been dismissed the labour court of appeal finally considered that the applicant chance of finding new employment were low nevertheless the employer interest in terminating the employment outweighed the applicant interest on march the federal labour court dismissed the applicant request to be granted leave to appeal on point of law on august the federal constitutional court refused to entertain the applicant constitutional complaint no bv r without providing reason ii relevant domestic law section of the collective agreement for public service employee in the eastern part of germany bundesangestelltentarifvertrag ost bato provides that an employee who ha worked a minimum period of five year in the public service may be dismissed with three month notice section of the unfair dismissal act provides that termination of an employment relationship by the employer is unlawful if it is socially unjustified under section of that act termination is socially unjustified unless it is inter alia based on ground relating to the employee himself or to his conduct article of the criminal code provides that a judge another public official or an arbitrator who in conducting or deciding a legal matter pervert the course of justice for the benefit or to the detriment of a party shall be liable to imprisonment from one to five year article of the code provides that unlawful act punishable by a minimum sentence of one year imprisonment are considered to be felony verbrechen iii council of europe document the model code of conduct for public official appended to recommendation no r of the committee of minister to member state on code of conduct for public official a far a relevant read a follows article the public official should carry out his or her duty in accordance with the law and with those lawful instruction and ethical standard which relate to his or her function the public official should act in a politically neutral manner and should not attempt to frustrate the lawful policy decision or action of the public authority article the public official ha the duty to serve loyally the lawfully constituted national local or regional authority the public official is expected to be honest impartial and efficient and to perform his or her duty to the best of his or her ability with skill fairness and understanding having regard only for the public interest and the relevant circumstance of the case the public official should be courteous both in his or her relation with the citizen he or she serf a well a in his or her relation with his or her superior colleague and subordinate staff the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that his dismissal from office violated his right to freedom of expression a provided in article of the convention which so far a relevant read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence the government contested that argument a admissibility the court note that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the applicant submission the applicant asserted that the staff meeting wa limited to the employee of the housing office and according to the relevant domestic law wa not public in order to encourage employee to speak out trade union representative could attend but were obliged to respect confidentiality the staff meeting wa therefore the place determined by law to express internal criticism according to the applicant the content of the criticism expressed by him wa entirely workrelated it wa not meant to reach the public but to denounce an internal grievance referring to the caselaw of the federal labour court the applicant submitted that under domestic law the expression of an erroneous legal opinion may not lead to sanction by the employer he therefore had the right to comment on the unlawfulness of w decision insofar a he used the expression perversion of justice this implied any kind of breach of law intentional or negligent but had by no mean to be understood a an accusation that w fulfilled all element of crime prescribed in article of the criminal code see paragraph above the applicant further submitted that w decision wa also related to the dissolution of the subdivision at that time the deputy mayor had already initiated a policy of rollback towards the regulation on misuse of housing property finally the applicant view the dismissal a disproportionate his transfer to a different workplace which wa not under the supervision of deputy mayor w would have been sufficient to resolve the conflict the municipality of dresden employed worker in seven department each of them led by a different deputy mayor it would therefore have been possible to continue to employ the applicant without risking another confrontation with w between and the applicant wa employed in another field of work and proved to be a reliable employee furthermore at the time of his dismissal the applicant wa year old his work experience wa of limited value on the job market and he therefore had not found any possibility save the employment between and to be integrated into the job market and lived on unemployment benefit the government submission the government agreed that there had been an interference with the applicant right under article of the convention but regarded this interference a justified to pursue the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or the right of others and to prevent the dissemination of confidential information referring widely to the argument of the federal labour court and the subsequent judgment of the labour court of appeal of november the government stressed that the applicant primary motivation wa to defame the mayor personally they argued that the applicant could not use the term perverting the course of justice without distinction a a lay person not working in a legal area might do furthermore the applicant had not undertaken any measure to resolve the dispute in this matter had no relevance whatsoever to the staff meeting in any case a staff meeting did not serve to monitor the general administrative conduct of the agency it could only address matter which had a direct impact on the agency or it employee the government concluded that the municipality of dresden had been entitled to assume that the applicant relationship with the deputy mayor w personally wa not only strained but that overall there wa no longer an expectation of loyalty and acceptance towards future supervisor or towards the city administration a employer finally the government added that there had been no possibility of a le severe option than the dismissal of the applicant and that the applicant nonobjectionable conduct during the temporary continuation of his employment had probably only occurred because his employment had been terminated assessment by the court the court reiterates that the protection of article of the convention extends to the workplace in general and to the public service in particular see among other authority wojtas kaleta v poland no july guja v moldova gc no february fuentes bobo v spain no february ahmed and others v the united kingdom no september accordingly the protection of article also applies to the statement made by the applicant during the staff meeting on december it follows that the dismissal from office which wa primarily based on these statement interfered with the applicant right to freedom of expression the court observes that the dismissal from office wa based on section of the collective agreement for public service employee in connection with section of the unfair dismissal act and wa thus prescribed by law within the meaning of article of the convention furthermore the applicant dismissal pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the deputy mayor honour and a professional work environment at the housing office thus the reputation and right of others it remains to be determined whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society the court reiterates the basic principle laid down in it judgment concerning article which have been summarised a follows see among other authority mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no july matúz v hungary no october vogt v germany gc no september i freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society a set forth in article this freedom is subject to exception which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article iii the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact the court further reiterates that employee have a duty of loyalty reserve and discretion to their employer this is particularly so in the case of the public service since the very nature of public service requires it employee to be bound by a duty of loyalty and discretion compare guja cited above see also article and of the model code of conduct for public official adopted by the committee of minister paragraph above furthermore under the court caselaw the signalling by an employee in the public sector of illegal conduct or wrongdoing in the workplace should in certain circumstance enjoy protection this may be called for where the employee concerned is the only person or part of a small category of person aware of what is happening at work and is thus best placed to act in the public interest by alerting the employer or the public at large see guja cited above and heinisch v germany no july the court task is therefore to determine whether in the light of the case a a whole the sanction imposed on the applicant wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason given by the national authority to justify it were relevant and sufficient compare palomo sánchez and others v spain gc no and september fuentes bobo cited above it ha to take into account the circumstance of the case including inter alia the applicant motivation for his statement it legal and factual base the actual wording and it possible interpretation the impact it had on the employer and the sanction inflicted on the applicant turning to the circumstance of the instant case with regard to the applicant motivation the court observes that at the time of the staff meeting the deputy mayor decision dated back almost two year moreover it appears that the applicant addressed his concern neither to w superior nor to the public prosecution the applicant himself claim that he did not want to address the public finally the issue wa not closely related to any subject on the agenda of the staff meeting the court further note that the federal labour court see paragraph above held that the applicant statement wa not aimed at uncovering an unacceptable situation within the housing office but wa rather motivated by the applicant personal misgiving about the deputy mayor arising from the prospect of the impending dissolution of his subdivision the current case ha therefore to be distinguished from case of whistleblowing an action warranting special protection under article of the convention in which an employee report a criminal offence in order to draw attention to alleged unlawful conduct of the employer see heinisch cited above the court further observes that the saxon labour court of appeal on the basis of a thorough examination of the factual and legal situation at the time the impugned demolition permit had been issued considered that the decision taken by the deputy mayor had been lawful and the applicant accusation of perversion of justice unfounded the court considers that the applicant a the longserving head of the subdivision in charge of sanctioning misuse of housing property must have been wellacquainted with the legal background accordingly the court is not convinced that he acquitted himself of the obligation to verify carefully whether his allegation were accurate insofar a the applicant alleged that he had used the term perversion of justice in a colloquial way and therefore had only intended to say that the disputed action of had been unlawful without implying any intention of w relevant under criminal law the court note that the federal labour court found that the applicant a the head of a subdivision of a public authority dealing with legal issue wa more adept in legal matter than the general public it is thus not unreasonable to assume that he should have been aware of the legal implication of the term perversion of justice in particular that it described an intentional abuse of public authority punishable with a minimum of one year imprisonment under article of the criminal code thus considered a felony under domestic law see paragraph above the court considers the unfounded allegation of a serious crime rather a defamatory accusation than a criticism in the interest of the public compare barfod v denmark no february and note that the saxon labour court of appeal held in it judgment that the applicant had never withdrawn his allegation that w had committed this crime the court further observes that the applicant wa given the opportunity to substantiate his allegation and that he repeated his accusation in written form more than a week after the staff meeting using the term perversion of justice several time in bold letter it follows that the dismissal wa not only based on the applicant spontaneous statement during the meeting but also on a written statement he submitted after having been given time to reflect on the impact of his allegation see palomo sanchez and others cited above and de diego nafría v spain no march moreover if in doubt he had the opportunity to verify the legal significance of the term perversion of justice after the staff meeting with respect to the damage suffered by the authority the domestic court found that the applicant accusation were not only likely to damage the deputy mayor reputation but also to interfere seriously with the working atmosphere within the housing office by undermining the deputy mayor authority the court observes that the accusation were not made publicly but during a staff meeting it note however that the federal labour court when assessing the impact of the applicant statement considered that not all person present at the staff meeting had been staff member and that there had been a risk that the applicant allegation would be made known to a wider public the court acknowledges that this intensified the potential impact of the accusation a well a the fact that the crime in question wa a felony and a such the attack on w reputation wa even graver for these reason the case must be distinguished from the case of rubin v latvia no january in which the domestic court had not established that insult had been made and the applicant based his accusation on fact undisputed by the party involved the court further note that the applicant did not act in the context of an ongoing labour conflict compare and contrast palomo sanchez and others cited above nor submit any trade union activity on the issue at stake nor claim to be a union activist himself the court observes that the applicant dismissal from office constituted the heaviest sanction possible under labour law compare heinisch cited above it further note that the saxon labour court of appeal in it judgment of november held that the applicant nonobjectionable conduct at another working place within the municipality of dresden wa likely to be due to his dismissal and the pending proceeding the court further observes that the labour court of appeal acknowledged the applicant difficulty in finding new employment at the age of but still found the dismissal necessary because the applicant behaviour also during the proceeding before the domestic court had shown that the applicant wa likely to reproach the deputy mayor conduct in the presence of other employee and in public it view that the municipality could rightfully fear that the applicant would return to his past behaviour if reinstated taking into account further element such a the applicant written comment and his letter to the editor is not unreasonable and a such is acceptable under the convention having regard to the above consideration and in particular to the fact that the federal labour court and the saxon labour court of appeal in it subsequent judgment both carefully examined the case in the light of the applicant right to freedom of expression the court considers relevant and sufficient the domestic court reason for deciding that the applicant right to freedom of expression did not outweigh the public employer interest in his dismissal the dismissal can not therefore be considered to amount to a disproportionate interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression the court concludes therefore that there ha been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the application admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rule of court claudia westerdiek mark villiger registrar

35,in and life in kyiv he wa represented by m ll pankratova a lawyer practising in the same city the government were represented by their agent most recently mr i lishchyna the fact of the case a submitted by the party may be summarised a follows background to the casethe article of march the applicant is a journalist at the material time he wa working for the national weekly analytical newspaper dzerkalo tyzhnya which had a circulation of approximately copy on march in a series of publication written by the applicant an article entitled black triad nothing else matter in the case чорна трійка все інше справи не стосується wa published in the above newspaper on march it wa published on the newspaper website in the article the author referred to a previous publication of his and noted that in a certain case no which had been pending for some time before the court and had at least twice been remitted to the lower court a judgment had been taken on the basis of a forged copy of a document the original of which wa part of the material in the case file in a certain set of criminal proceeding the donetsk commercial court of appeal had nevertheless delivered it judgment on the basis of the forged copy the applicant went on describing what he called a system for obtaining a required result in order to get the result a particular law firm had been contacted the law firm had been paid a substantial fee by the plaintiff but had then surprisingly taken no further part in the proceeding in which the plaintiff a state enterprise had been represented by it own lawyer a for the court they had carefully referred the case up to the higher commercial court which in turn had taken an excessively long time over the proceeding before finally remitting the case to a lower court for the absence of a copy of the decision complained of in the meantime the plaintiff had been liquidated which according to the applicant had allowed numerous wrongdoing to be hidden the full text of the article read a follows in may last year dt dzerkalo tyzhnya no may published an article entitled how the court validated the copy of the document while the original document wa missing як суд легалізував копію при відсутності оригіналу it discussed an unprecedented legal incident in the history of ukrainian justice that occurred when based on a highly doubtful copy in term of the quality of the print and even more in term of the content of a certain document a guarantee letter the court delivered a judgment that ha been challenged by the respondent for four year now incidentally it wa challenged at the same time a the presidential decree on the formation of appellate court in ukraine wa issued for one simple reason according to the respondent they have never issued a document with such a registration number to the plaintiff and have not provided any guarantee nevertheless since there are many different method to make any conflict of interest palatable for themis the case ha become a kind of symbol of dignity and a fetish of the shortcoming of the very structural judicial system adopted from the developed democracy which wa based on a system tainted with sovietness совковостью and telephone law formation of the principle of independence of the third branch of power in our state paragraph dt ha repeatedly described the vicissitude of the litigation and mutual claim of the party in the dispute in the three year before the publication of the abovementioned article case no underwent two round of court proceeding from the court of first instance to the judgment of the supreme court of ukraine there wa also a third round under newly discovered circumstance in the scope of criminal proceeding instigated against the limited liability company n which stole from a state transport shipping enterprise intertrans something it wa not specified what worth more than million hryvnia uah and then vanished without a trace the prosecutor office discovered the original of the controversial guarantee letter it turned out that the guarantee letter referred to by the plaintiff intertrans had been provided by the defendant to a completely different enterprise which had initially been stated by the party at all the court hearing however for some reason that wa never taken into account the donetsk commercial court of appeal could have set the record straight but instead having established the existence of the guarantee letter in the criminal case file it delivered a decision based on a copy of that letter accordingly this author naturally asked the question i wonder what the commercial justice system will come up with this time in order to protect the state enterprisestructure that caused substantial pecuniary damage to the state paragraph reality ha surpassed the most daring expectation further immersion in the twilight of this dark and shady subject of how commercial dispute in the donetsk region are resolved give you the impression that a system exists that is quite primitive in term of the scheme and reliable in term of efficiency for obtaining the desired result in almost any case at the same time one get the impression that the essence of the problem doe not matter at all to it facilitator what is important is that the customer usually the plaintiff come to the right place at the right time paragraph a a rule this is a law firm to which large amount are legally transferred for legal service subsequently it is difficult to follow what active role the law firm take in the court proceeding instead the representative appear or a in the case of intertrans which for some unknown reason paid a fee of uah to the mysterious i are content with the participation of their own lawyer in the court proceeding throughout the entire process the case is considered by a host of servant of commercial justice in the donetsk region who pas it on with care and concern up to the higher commercial court of ukraine paragraph so when the original copy and then an additional document proving the forgery of the copy were discovered it became clear that it wa no longer necessary to discus the adversarial nature of the argument but the falsification and intent which is not the subject matter of commercial dispute but of criminal investigation and again just the fact the higher commercial court of ukraine hccu made it mark once again contrary to part of article of the commercial procedural code of ukraine which provides for a onemonth period for examining a request for review of a court decision due to newly discovered circumstance the hccu delayed examining the case for nine month paragraph first the hccu received all the necessary material from the donetsk court of appeal and appointed the day of the hearing but when the party arrived at kopylenka st in kyiv they discovered that nothing wa going to happen apparently the document wa missing accordingly the hccu immediately established a it can be seen from the content of the cassation appeal the defendant challenged the ruling of the donetsk commercial court of appeal of june however the case file doe not contain the contested ruling or any mention thereof therefore case no must be remitted to the donetsk regional commercial court for proper registration in accordance with the requirement of the law in force so a new date wa set and the donetsk regional commercial court wa assigned with a task although it clear that it wa meant for the donetsk commercial court of appeal but these are different state institution arent they or maybe it ha been a single structure for a long time a fact the judiciary of the largest commercial court of first instance in ukraine still doe not even suspect but which is clear to kyiv and thats why they wrote it paragraph in short so far no one ha bothered to answer where the ruling wa and where it suddenly came from in the material of case no they quietly sweep it under the carpet although most likely it wasnt an accident and they were achieving a specific task to delay consideration of the case until february indeed on that very day in accordance with order no of september of the ministry of transport in order to increase the efficiency of the use of state property the liquidation of intertrans wa completed and it wa removed from the united state register of enterprise and organisation of ukraine everything turned out a planned the court hearing took place after the specified date and the case file ha not yet been returned from kyiv to donetsk note this is only a part of the state problem inherited from the previous leadership of the ministry of transport informed source claim that the liquidation of intertrans made it possible to bury amount much larger than the unjustly recovered fund from ibank based on the copy however this is yet another topic worthy of journalistic attention paragraph the article ended with the following paragraph the eighth and ninth paragraph by the way ch the managing director of jointstock company d conducted an investigation and came to the conclusion that there wa an organised group operating in the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal in a letter to the head of the parliamentary subcommittee on combating organised crime and corruption in lawenforcement body and court he set out the name of the member of the group and the detailed mode of operation of the whole scheme a proof ch cited case no in which he had been a defendant against the state enterprise ugolnaya kompaniya krasnolimanskaya concerning the invalidation of a contract a well a a number of other similar dispute which were subsequently quashed by the supreme court of ukraine the judge well known from case no appear everywhere paragraph the reason for my address to the verkhovna rada said ch wa case no while the case wa going through all the judicial instance i felt the pressure of the system let say an interested client come knocking and asks for assistance with a case that will clearly lose they recommend that he go to law firm l then the contract is concluded with the client the money is transferred and the claim is prepared then in spite of any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge after that the case is always decided in the client favour if another party lodge an appeal a socalled black triad exists which embrace the principle that nothing else matter in the case most people who have been through these two judicial instance give up they lose their faith in justice and do not apply anywhere else they say to themselves they are all tarred with the same brush paragraph interim injunction proceeding on april judge a c d e b and f applied to the voroshylovsky district court of donetsk city hereinafter the district court for the application of preventive measure and securing of evidence заява про вжиття запобіжних заходів та про забезпечення доказів they argued that the article of march black triad nothing else matter in the case contained a negative evaluation of the activity of the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal and wa not based on any fact the style of the article wa extremely negative in particular the claimant indicated that the following statement did not correspond to reality an organised group the detailed mode of operation of the whole scheme the pressure of the system assistance with a case that will clearly lose in spite of any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge about existence of a black triad and the principle of nothing else matter in the case the applicant had not verified the information in question and had thus failed to comply with his professional duty according to the claimant the publication in question breached the honour dignity and professional reputation of the abovementioned court their management and the judge in particular it wa noted that judge e c d and f had examined case no which wa mentioned in the publication and therefore the article had caused them nonpecuniary damage similar damage had been caused to a the head of the donetsk commercial court of appeal who wa responsible for the organisational management of the court and b the deputy head of the donetsk regional commercial court who according to distribution of duty performed management of the structural unit that included the judge who had examined case no the claimant stated that they would lodge a defamation claim for damage against the newspaper the applicant and ch they eventually did so on april and august see paragraph below a the article in question contained element of an interview ie the last paragraph containing eventually the majority of the untrustful information referring inter alia to article and of the civil code of ukraine the ccu see paragraph below they argued that their right were being infringed while the article wa still available online and requested it removal under article of the code of civil procedure the ccp see paragraph below the claimant request wa for an order against the editorial board of the newspaper to remove the article from the newspaper website in addition they also asked for the attachment of the newspaper property the property of the applicant and that of ch in order to secure their claim finally they asked that the newspaper provide the document their editorial board and the applicant had used to verify the information published in the article on april the district court ordered the editorial board of dzerkalo tyzhnya to remove the article from the newspaper website in it oneandahalfpage decision the court merely reiterated the content of the claimant request the court then referred to article of the ccp which set out the possible injunction measure for securing a claim and noted that the request should be granted in part providing no reasoning or assessment of the claimant position the applicant the newspaper and ch appealed against this decision noting inter alia that an interim injunction such a taking an article down from a website wa not prescribed under domestic law and furthermore that the court had referred to article of the ccp which provided for interim measure after lodging a claim and not before they further noted that the court had failed to provide any reasoning in particular they argued that the article had not named a single judge and that therefore the claimant had failed to prove that their right had been breached on august the donetsk regional court of appeal upheld the district court decision having reiterated the claimant request and quoted article of the ccu the court noted the following the challenged article carry information which is disseminated on the internet since such information is accessible to the general public and is difficult to control the removal of the article from the website similar to a property attachment under paragraph of article of the ccp is the only measure that would ensure protection of the individual right pending examination of the case on the merit the firstinstance court relied on article of the ccp which provides for securing a claim by prohibiting certain action such reference is erroneous since no claim had been lodged at the time when the ruling wa delivered however this shortcoming can not serve a a ground for quashing the court ruling a the request had been examined on the merit correctly the applicant appealed in cassation arguing that article of the ccp did not prescribe any interim measure such a removing an article from a website he further stated that the court had failed to provide any reasoning for it decision and that the claimant had not provided any evidence to support their argument that their right had been infringed some two and a half year later on january the kyiv court of appeal sitting a a cassation court rejected the applicant appeal against the decision of april and august for lack of evidence of breach of the law the above judicial decision were enforced and the impugned article wa removed from the newspaper website on an unspecified date but no later than august subsequent publication on march a the head of the donetsk commercial court of appeal and b a former deputy head of the donetsk regional commercial court sent a letter to the chief editor of dzerkalo tyzhnya demanding a retraction of the information published in the article of march they provided a text to be published for that purpose the letter wa received at the office of the newspaper on march on april following the interim injunction issued by the voroshyloskyy district court of donetsk see paragraph above dzerkalo tyzhnya published an article entitled black triad to be continued чорна трійка далі буде indicating a and b a the author of the letter requesting the retraction the article which apparently wa a summary of the text of their letter of march read a follows every court case is a complicated tangle of antagonistic interest of the party and it settlement irrespective of the outcome will always leave one of the party unsatisfied even when a party understands the lack of ground for it appeal against the court decision very often only the requirement of paying the court and legal fee would stop it from lodging such an appeal most people naturally consider all decision in their favour a lawful and fair and vice versa everyone who ha acted a a judge in any dispute know the loser will most probably regard the decision a unfair and biased on march dt dzerkalo tyzhnya published an article by anatoliy yeremenko entitled black triad nothing else matter in the case the article raised very important and relevant problem for modern ukrainian society it cite the story of the managing director of jointstock company d ch who allegedly discovered unlawful activity on the part of judge of the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal however many were surprised by chs hard feeling towards the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal indeed given the number of case won by jointstock company d and the strength of those case it should have been more likely for his opponent in those case to have had reason to feel that way take for example the decision in case no according to which the claimant jointstock company d wa awarded uah however another case no is cited a an example in the article for some unknown reason the request of d managing director under article to of the code of commercial procedure of ukraine to have his case examined by a bench of judge being disregarded wa not mentioned in the newspaper article we shall explain for those who are not lawyer that these article provide for the examination of case by a bench of judge in a local commercial court where their category and complexity so requires however ch based his request exclusively on the necessity to avoid any pressure on the court by the opposite party which is not a ground for allowing the examination of the case by a bench of judge therefore if we follow the letter of the law the court should have rejected chs request a unlawful however having taken into consideration the category of the case and the extensive number of circumstance to be examined the court allowed his request it follows that the claimant is either unable to understand the text of the law but take the liberty to criticise court decision or he consciously provoked the court to reject the request in order to have an excuse to complain later about the court bias but despite the positive decision about the composition of the court in case no ch asserts that then in spite of any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge it is easy to remark that such a conclusion contradicts the fact a well a the conclusion that the case is always decided in the client favour and that there is a socalled black triad in the court of appeal even more offensive is his final conclusion that they are all tarred with the same brush the only lawful way to receive a decision in your favour is to act within the law and to provide sufficient argument and valid evidence but some it is unlikely that they could be called lawabiding citizen stop at nothing if the end justifies the mean why not try all of them the easiest from a practical point of view but we emphasise not effective and the least ethical way to convince the court to adopt the required decision is to issue a warning in a manner akin to it is better not to mess with me by manipulating public opinion such people try to influence the decision of public servant including judge indeed hardly anybody would wish to be associated with the black triad currently the donetsk regional commercial court is examining the case in which d is one of the party so is the tragical farce of ch not an attempt to scare the court and to influence it future judgment suggesting that the black triad article could be continued with the family name of all the judge with firm belief and they could later try to prove their integrity publicly it is well known the higher a person social status the more society is inclined towards believing in the most absurd gossip about them so they have to prove their innocence therefore the negative evaluation of the functioning of the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal wa given in the absence of any merit in particular there is no reason to believe that there is an organised group involved in unlawful activity operating in the abovementioned court there is no practice of assisting interested client in obtaining positive decision in case that will clearly lose in the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal furthermore the employee of these court never recommend particular law firm it is also untrue that despite any existing procedure the case are given to the right judge in order to deliver a decision in the case in favour of the client the court doe not and can not have client and decision in the case mentioned in the article were taken after impartial examination of all the circumstance of the case and the evidence submitted by the party there are no ground to conclude that most people who went through the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal gave up and lost their faith in justice and that they do not apply anywhere else on may the claimant sent another letter to the chief editor of dzerkalo tyzhnya demanding that the newspaper print a retraction stressing that their previous request had not been addressed adequately since the publication had been printed without a mention in the title of the word retraction and that it had contained only summarised element of their letter of march on may the chief editor of dzerkalo tyzhnya replied that the above demand wa groundless before the examination of the respective claim by the court and the pronouncement of the respective judgment defamation proceeding on april and august the same claimant see paragraph above lodged defamation claim against the applicant ch and the editorial board of dzerkalo tyzhnya they claimed that their professional reputation honour and dignity had been damaged by the article in question according to them the statement contained in the article had undermined the authority of the judiciary in their updated claim the judge asked the court to recognise the following statement a defamatory there wa an organised group operating in the donetsk regional commercial court and in the donetsk commercial court of appeal that ch had discovered a detailed mode of operation of the whole scheme the pressure of the system an interested client come knocking and asks for assistance with a case that will clearly lose they recommend that he go to law firm l then the contract is concluded with the client the money is transferred and the claim is prepared then despite any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge after that the case is always decided in the client favour if another party lodge an appeal a socalled black triad exists which embrace the principle that nothing else matter in the case and they are all tarred with the same brush they further asked the court to order the editorial board of dzerkalo tyzhnya to publish a retraction of the above statement and to order the applicant and ch to pay ukrainian hryvnia uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage to each claimant they noted that the newspaper had partly restored their right by allowing them to exercise their right to reply to the allegation in the impugned article and by removing the article from their website in his response to the claim the applicant insisted that the statement concerned contained information important to the general public and the source of the information were ch and chs letter to the parliamentary subcommittee he further noted that he had duly verified that the letter had indeed been submitted to parliament and that it wa a ground for a related inquiry by the lawenforcement service at the same time he stated that chs remark were in line with the result of his own journalistic investigation in respect of case no and which were based on the case file of those case the applicant considered that since he had received the information from an official of an organisation he wa relieved from liability for published material by virtue of section of the press act lastly the applicant noted that the claimant name had never been mentioned in the article and that there were at least twelve other judge who had examined the case in issue in the donetsk regional commercial court but who had not lodged a defamation claim he also referred to his previous article of may in which a and c had been named but against which they had never initiated defamation proceeding in support of his argument the applicant attached inter alia chs letter to the parliamentary subcommittee the case file of several case he had examined in the context of his investigation including case no and his previous article on the topic in question on an unspecified date the applicant and ch also lodged counterclaim the applicant stated that before initiating defamation proceeding and requesting the interim injunction a c d e b and f had illegally obtained his personal information including his name and contact detail he asked the court to find such action unlawful ch asked the court to determine that the information contained in the judge letter to the newspaper published on april see paragraph above wa untrue on october the petrovskyy local court examined the case on the merit having analysed the eighth and ninth paragraph of the article in question the court allowed the judge claim in part the court concluded that the statement contained in those paragraph were defamatory had presented a distorted view of reality and were not based on actual fact and their publication had resulted in nonpecuniary damage being inflicted on all the claimant the relevant part of the court judgment read a follows the information contained in the relevant paragraph of the article did not correspond to reality and tarnished the honour dignity and reputation of the claimant in view of the following at the court hearing the applicant confirmed that in the eighth and ninth paragraph of the article he had used information provided by ch including the letter to the parliamentary subcommittee along with chs succinct commentary which disclosed element of an interview the respondent ch confirmed that the author had used the information provided by him in the eighth and ninth paragraph of the impugned article upon analysis of the ninth paragraph of the article it is established that it wa published in the form of an interview pursuant to section of the copyright and related right act the copyright of a recorded interview is to be regarded a coauthorship the interviewee and the interviewer are coauthor of the interview the court considers that the applicant and ch are coauthor of the article in the letter addressed to the head of the parliamentary subcommission on combating organised crime and corruption ch stated that an organised criminal group wa operating in the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk regional court of appeal which on demand provided judgment and ruling required by client he named the member of the group and described how it operated ch also sent this letter to the state security service and wa informed that his allegation were being verified in response to an enquiry of the donetsk commercial court of appeal on april the administration of the security service of ukraine in the donetsk region reported that upon examination перевірки of chs allegation no proof of the existence and activity of such an organised criminal group in the abovementioned court had been found therefore the relevant statement published in the eighth paragraph of the article had not been proved and accordingly they were untrue the article referred to chs letter to in which he directly mentioned a criminal organisation that existed in the abovementioned court even though the article did not reproduce the content of that letter the statement in the eighth and ninth paragraph suggested to the reader that the existence of a criminal group wa being discussed in their description of the procedure for distributing and examining case the coauthor of the article accused the judge of the above court not only of violating bylaw but also of what could be interpreted a abuse of office and a miscarriage of justice both being criminal offence the expression organised group wa used in the article in the criminal sense and wa associated with a criminal offence committed by an organised group pursuant to article of the constitution of ukraine a person is presumed innocent of committing a crime until their guilt is proved in accordance with the law and established by a verdict of a court no such verdict ha been delivered in respect of the claimant by any domestic court and therefore those statement were defamatory at the same time the court can not take into consideration the defendant argument according to which at the court hearing they had provided evidence in support of their statement a to the existence of a special procedure for examining case in view of the following a noted above the statement a to the existence of a special procedure for examining case in the abovementioned court constitute an accusation that a crime ha been committed which must be proved by certain mean in view of article of the constitution a to the presumption of innocence the above statement can be proved only by a verdict of a court which doe not exist in respect of the claimant section of the press act provides that a journalist is exempted from liability for the publication of material that is untrue defames the honour and dignity of citizen and organisation infringes the right and lawful interest of citizen or constitutes abuse of the freedom of the printed mass medium and the right of journalist if the information is contained in a reply to a request for access to official document and to a request for written or oral information provided in accordance with the information act section of the information act provides that a request for access to official document is a request addressed to relevant state authority or it official in order to examine the official document since jointstock company d wa not a state body and it managing director ch wa not an official of a state authority his letter could not be considered an official document within the meaning of section of the press act and section of the information act under section of the information act value judgment are not subject to retraction or proof of veracity the information in the eighth and ninth paragraph of the article particularly the following statement can be interpreted a containing factual information and thus they are not value judgment ch came to the conclusion that there wa an organised group operating in the donetsk regional commercial court and in the donetsk commercial court of appeal an interested client come knocking and asks for assistance with a case that will clearly lose they recommend that he go to the law firm l then the contract is concluded with the client the money is transferred and the statement of claim is prepared then in spite of any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge after that the case is always decided in the client favour if another party lodge an appeal a socalled black triad exists which embrace the principle that nothing else matter in the case by virtue of article of the ccu one of the element of the offence is dissemination of information about a person which would enable an observer to deduce that it concern a specific identifiable individual or at least that the person belongs to a group of people to whom such information pertains indication of the person name is not obligatory for information to be considered a concerning a specific person if he or she is identifiable on the basis of other element the claimant a c d and e are judge at the donetsk commercial court of appeal and b and f at the donetsk regional commercial court in addition a is a head of the donetsk commercial court of appeal and b used to be a deputy head of the donetsk regional commercial court in the article the author assert the existence of an organised group in the abovementioned court which ha been found by this court to be inaccuratefalse this fact alone tarnish the dignity honour and reputation of the managing official of such court namely a and ba proof of the existence of an organised group in the abovementioned court the author refer to case no having examined the case file of the above case the court established that b assigned f to examine case no f wa a presiding judge at the firstinstance court examination of this case and e c and d further examined this case in the court of appeal thus a a result of the publication of untrue information all of the above judge sustained nonpecuniary damage including b who at the material time wa deputy head of the donetsk regional commercial court and wa managing the court division comprising the judge who had examined the case at first instance a the head of donetsk commercial court of appeal who is responsible for the organisational management of the court where the case in issue wa examined on appeal also sustained nonpecuniary damage the court dismisses the respondent argument concerning the fact that the name of the claimant had not been mentioned since the coauthor of the article provided sufficient information to identify them in addition the information on judge examining the domestic case wa not restricted the copy of the court decision had been sent to the party and information about these judge could be known to an unlimitedunrestricted number of person when setting a compensation to be paid to the claimant by the applicant and ch the court noted that the applicant wa guilty to a lesser degree since it wa ch who had provided him with the information however the applicant had failed to verify the information and had thus failed in his professional duty a set out in section of the press act the court ordered the editorial board of dzerkalo tyzhnya to publish a retraction of the statement contained in the eighth and ninth paragraph of the article and the applicant to pay uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage to each of the claimant plus their legal uah per claimant and court fee uah per claimant in total the applicant wa ordered to pay the equivalent of euro eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage and eur in respect of legal and court fee ch wa ordered to pay uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage per claimant plus legal and court fee finally the court dismissed the applicant and chs counterclaim a unsubstantiated the applicant appealed against the judgment of october of the petrovskyy local court relying on the following argument i the court had failed to substantiate the existence of the nonpecuniary damage by not giving concrete reason for the effect the article had had on the claimant and their psychological health ii the court had failed to make a distinction between the fact and value judgment in this respect the applicant noted that the phrase tarred with the same brush wa clearly a value judgment yet it had not been examined by the court separately and had been found defamatory a a part of the whole text iii the material in the case file of case no and a number of other case were sufficient to conclude that the statement published in the article were true iv the court had failed to examine the existence of men rea in the applicant action v the court had gone beyond what had been claimed in the complaint and had found defamatory the wider content of the statement published in the article he referred to the fact that the court had relied on the full text of the eighth and ninth paragraph instead of only the particular statement quoted by the claimant in their complaint for example the phrase ch concluded and most of the people and vi the amount of the court fee he had been ordered to pay to the claimant wa excessive on january the donetsk regional court of appeal upheld the firstinstance court judgment on the merit and modified it concerning legal and court fee reducing the court fee imposed on the applicant to the equivalent of eur the relevant part of the appellate court judgment read a follows it follows from the content of the impugned article that the respondent ch had conducted his own investigation and concluded that there wa an organised group in the donetsk regional commercial court and donetsk regional court of appeal with reference to the letter of the head of the subcommittee of verkhovna rada naming the member of the group and the detailed mode of operation of the whole scheme there are reference to case no and the ninth paragraph contains a direct speech and it discus on behalf of ch case no at the court hearing the respondent maintained that the information published a to the existence of an organised group in the court in question wa true they insisted that case no a well a other case had been allocated by b and a to their judge in violation of the order on specialisation of the court composition they submitted the order allocating the case noting the breach allegedly committed during the allocation of case no and others the court reasonably rejected the respondent argument the allocation of case in the court in question is an internal matter for the court and such circumstance can not point to the existence of an organised group or functioning of a scheme with interested client at the time the article wa published the claimant had not been convicted or found liable of act of corruption it follows from the certificate in the case file that all the claimant serve a judge at the court in question in the article the claimant were accused of violating the law during the examination of commercial case however such circumstance were not proved at the court hearing in support of their argument the respondent referred to the allocation of the case in violation of specialisation order but they did not provide any factual data to prove the information published in the article in his cassation appeal the applicant reiterated his previous argument and also noted that after reading chs letter he had conducted his own investigation and relying on the material in the case file he considered that he had verified the respective information with due diligence by a final decision of november the kyiv court of appeal acting a a court of cassation rejected the applicant

article from the website pending the examination of the defamation case and holding him liable for the publication of the impugned article had been in breach of article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the court note that the complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merit general principlesa medium and journalistic freedom of expression the general principle were reiterated in bédat v switzerland gc no march and more recently in editorial board of grivna newspaper v ukraine no and april i freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society a set forth in article this freedom is subject to exception which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court iii the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact the court ha consistently emphasised that the press play an essential role in a democratic society although it must not overstep certain bound regarding in particular protection of the reputation and right of others it duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with it obligation and responsibility information and idea on all matter of public interest including those relating to justice not only doe it have the task of imparting such information and idea the public also ha a right to receive them article of the convention protects not only the substance of the idea and information expressed but also the form in which they are conveyed journalistic freedom also cover possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation see perna v italy gc no echr v with further reference the court ha observed that the protection afforded by article of the convention to journalist however is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenet of responsible journalism see bédat cited above the concept of responsible journalism is not confined to the content of information which is collected andor disseminated by journalistic mean this concept also embrace the lawfulness of the conduct of a journalist see pentikäinen v finland gc no echr b judge a the subject of publication and the limit of acceptable criticism the general principle relating to maintaining the authority of the judiciary were summarised in morice v france gc no echr question concerning the functioning of the justice system an institution that is essential for any democratic society fall within the public interest in this connection regard must be had to the special role of the judiciary in society a the guarantor of justice a fundamental value in a state governed by the rule of law it must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out it duty it may therefore prove necessary to protect such confidence against gravely damaging attack that are essentially unfounded especially in view of the fact that judge who have been criticised are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying the phrase authority of the judiciary includes in particular the notion that the court are and are accepted by the public at large a being the proper forum for the resolution of legal dispute further that the public at large have respect for and confidence in the court capacity to fulfil that function what is at stake is the confidence which the court in a democratic society must inspire not only in the accused a far a criminal proceeding are concerned but also in the public at large nevertheless save in the case of gravely damaging attack that are essentially unfounded bearing in mind that judge form part of a fundamental institution of the state they may a such be subject to personal criticism within the permissible limit and not only in a theoretical and general manner when acting in their official capacity they may thus be subject to wider limit of acceptable criticism than ordinary citizen ibid a regard the level of protection of freedom of expression there is little scope under article of the convention for restriction on debate on matter of public interest accordingly a high level of protection of freedom of expression with the authority thus having a particularly narrow margin of appreciation will normally be accorded where the remark concern a matter of public interest a is the case in particular for remark on the functioning of the judiciary even in the context of proceeding that are still pending in respect of other defendant a degree of hostility and the potential seriousness of certain remark do not obviate the right to a high level of protection of freedom of expression given the existence of a matter of public interest see paturel v france no december and morice cited above application of those principle regarding the injunction proceedingsa the party submissionsi the applicant the applicant did not dispute the legitimate aim of the removal of the article from the website but submitted that the measure had not been prescribed by domestic law or necessary in a democratic society he stated that the domestic court had failed to conduct any preliminary analysis a to whether the published information wa true and based on fact or whether it had violated the right of the judge who had requested the measureii the government the government did not contest that there had been an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression they maintained that the measure had been based on law namely article and of the ccu section of the information act and section of the press act and that those provision had been sufficiently accessible and clear they added that the interference had served the legitimate aim of protecting the right and reputation of the judge and preserving the authority of the judiciary the government noted that the article in question had included expression which after being analysed by the court in the main proceeding had been found to contain untrue information therefore given the public access to the article on the newspaper website the measure had served a the only way of protecting the right of others before examination of the defamation case in view of the above the domestic court had been forced to interfere with the applicant right to freedom of expression by partially allowing the claimant request and the interference had been necessary in order to protect the right and the reputation of othersb the court assessmenti whether there ha been an interference the court note that it is not in dispute between the party that the decision of the domestic court ordering the removal of the article in question from the newspaper website constituted an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expressionii whether the interference wa prescribed by law the court note that the first and most important requirement of article of the convention is that any interference by a public authority with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression should be lawful the first sentence of the second paragraph essentially envisages that any restriction on expression must be prescribed by law in order to comply with this requirement interference doe not merely have to have a basis in domestic law the law itself must correspond to certain requirement of quality in particular a norm can not be regarded a a law unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct he must be able if need be with appropriate advice to foresee to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstance the consequence which a given action may entail those consequence need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty whilst certainty is desirable it may bring in it train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstance accordingly many law are inevitably couched in term which to a greater or lesser extent are vague and whose interpretation and application are question of practice see for example lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc no and echr iv turning to the circumstance of the present case the court observes that the applicant challenged the lawfulness of the interference being of the view that an interim measure such a the removal of an article from a website had not been prescribed by the law at the material time the court note at the outset that the interim injunction request had been lodged at least ten day before the defamation claim that followed and that the legal provision expressly provided for a situation where an injunction request is lodged before the court in the absence of a pending case a to the domestic provision on which the court of appeal relied when upholding the interim measure the court note that it interpreted article of the ccp which relates to property attachment a encompassing an order to remove content from a website having regard to the broad term in which that provision is framed it would appear capable of encompassing both print and digital content the court of appeal explicitly overruled the district court reliance on article of the ccp which it considered erroneous furthermore article of the ccp explicitly provides for the possibility of requesting and ordering an interim injunction before the main claim is lodged having regard to the fact that the national court are best placed for interpreting and applying rule of substantive and procedural law the court observes that it ha no reason to call into question the interpretation and application of domestic law by the court of appeal in the present case the court also note that the foreseeability requirement doe not exclude the law from being partly left to the interpretation of the judge see for example kudrevičius and others v lithuania gc no and echr an individual can not argue that a legal provision lack foreseeability simply because it is applied for the first time in his case see satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june the mere fact that a legal provision is capable of more than one construction doe not mean that it doe not meet the requirement of foreseeability see perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extract therefore while it would have been preferable for the government to provide further information on the relevant caselaw of the domestic court concerning the interpretation and application of the provision in question particularly article of the ccp the court can proceed on the premise that the interference had a basis in domestic lawiii whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim the court is satisfied that the interference in question pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation of others and most importantly maintaining the authority of the judiciaryiv whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society the court note that interim injunction by their very nature are temporary measure which merely aim to provide provisional protection to the party concerned pending the examination of the claim on it merit in case where the postponement of such measure until after a final decision on the merit would risk causing irreparable harm to the person seeking the injunction or where the judicial examination of the claim would otherwise be impeded see cumhuriyet vakfı and others v turkey no october while article of the convention doe not prohibit interim injunction even where they entail prior restraint on publication the apparent danger inherent in such measure call for the most careful scrutiny by the court see edition plon v france no echr iv the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority basing themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article of the convention see among many others zana v turkey no november report of judgment and decision vii in addition the fairness of the proceeding and the procedural guarantee afforded are factor to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with respect to the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention including a close examination of the procedural safeguard embedded in the system to prevent arbitrary encroachment upon the freedom of expression see association ekin v france no echr viii steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii lombardi vallauri v italy no october and igor kabanov v russia no february in the present case the claimant considering that the publication in question encroached on their dignity honour and reputation lodged a request for it to be removed from the newspaper website and also sought the attachment of the newspaper property see paragraph above the court note firstly that the domestic court granted the request only insofar a it concerned the removal of the publication from the newspaper website and that no measure were sought or imposed in respect of the printed copy of the newspaper which contained the same publication and which could remain in circulation see paragraph above in this regard it can be considered that the injunction did not put an end to the dissemination of the publication in all form and wa not of a sweeping nature see in contrast obukhova v russia no january therefore the fact that the publication wa not available on the newspaper website pending the examination of the defamation case did not totally hamper the applicant ability to disseminate information and idea the interference with the applicant freedom of expression wa not therefore of a significant magnitude the court further note that the request for interim measure wa submitted on april nearly a month after the publication of the article on march in print and roughly three week after it wa published on the newspaper website on march see paragraph and above while it is true that there is no information about the exact date on which the claimant learned about the publication this must have happened before march the date on which they demanded it retraction and publication of their response therefore the article in question had already been freely available to the public for nearly a month news is a perishable commodity and to delay it publication even for a short period may well deprive it of all it value and interest see for example observer and guardian v the united kingdom november series a no the sunday time v the united kingdom no november series a no and association ekin cited above in the present case being available to the public for nearly a month before being removed and that only from the internet site and not from the free circulation it could be concluded that such removal did not undermine the very essence of the public debate the court is particularly conscious of the fact that issue covered by the article in question concerned the functioning of the justice system while those issue definitely constitute question of public interest the debate on which enjoys the protection of article of the convention the court ha on many occasion emphasised the special role in society of the judiciary which a the guarantor of justice a fundamental value in a lawgoverned state must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out it duty it may therefore prove necessary to protect that confidence against destructive attack which are essentially unfounded especially in view of the fact that judge who have been criticised are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no the court find it a matter of concern that the court of first instance limited it reasoning in respect of the injunction to citing exhibit from the claimant request while the court of appeal looked to the dissemination of the information on the internet and considered that it temporary removal wa the only measure which would protect the applicant interest pending examination of the case on the merit see paragraph and above when reasoning is succinct it can make it difficult for the court to ass whether the national authority duly balanced the party interest at stake see cumhuriyet vakfı and others cited above at the same time the court is conscious of the fact that by their very nature ruling on interim measure are issued a a matter of urgency and can not always contain finely calibrated and detailed reasoning equivalent to that required in the main defamation proceeding the court finally point out that the interim injunction concerned the whole article despite the fact that the alleged damaging statement had been only in two paragraph however the applicant never raised before the court of appeal and the cassation court the argument that the injunction could have been limited to two paragraph of the publication in view of the above the court concludes that in the particular circumstance of the present case the necessary in a democratic society requirement contained in the second paragraph of article of the convention wa met and the interim injunction can not be said to have constituted a disproportionate interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression accordingly there ha been no violation of article of the convention on account of the domestic court decision in the injunction proceeding application of those principle regarding the defamation proceedingsa the party submissionsi the applicant the applicant argued that he had thoroughly and diligently verified all the fact provided by ch and that the latter had supported those fact in the court proceeding he further noted that he had simply quoted chs statement containing the latter own evaluation of the situation in the court in question and reported that ch had sent a letter regarding that situation to the head of the parliamentary subcommittee thus he had been held liable for the verbatim reproduction of a third party opinion the applicant further stated that the burden of proving that chs statement were true wa incompatible with exercising the right to freedom of expression referring to thorgeir thorgeirson v iceland june series a no lyashko v ukraine no august gazeta ukraina tsentr v ukraine no july and thoma v luxembourg no echr iii the applicant further argued that by virtue of section of the press act he wa exempted from civil liability for reproducing verbatim official statement of the official of state authority organisation and association of citizen he referred to article of the ccu according to which information provided by an official while on official duty wa considered authentic and a person disseminating such information wa not obliged to verify it authenticity and would not be held liable if such information wa disproven see paragraph above the applicant considered that the above provision were vague and their consequence had not been foreseeable to him since they did not clearly prescribe that the official in question could only be an official of a state body a the domestic court held in his case see paragraph above he stated that a concerned the defamation proceeding there had been no legitimate aim for the interference with his right under article of the convention since the true aim of the claimant had been to intimidate him a a journalist the applicant argued that the domestic court had never examined the issue of the necessity and had not taken into account the public interest of the information published in the article the domestic court had failed to examine the article a a whole and a part of a series of article disclosing a miscarriage of justice by the commercial court the applicant stated that at the time when the article had been published he had been unaware of the result of the examination conducted by the state security service which he had only found out about on april he had therefore had a sufficient factual basis for the critical evaluation of the fact in the impugned article the applicant observed that at the time of the publication of the impugned article there had been no public register of court decision and that the party to the proceeding who had received copy of the relevant decision or who had known the judge examining the case formed a fairly limited circle of person furthermore the case mentioned in the article had been examined by many more judge throughout all the round of proceeding however only six of them had lodged a defamation claim he therefore considered that the statement a to the information about the claimant being accessible to an unlimited number of people had been greatly exaggerated he maintained that the penalty of retraction ordered by the court in the defamation proceeding had been disproportionate a the newspaper had already printed a refutation by publication of the letter of a and b and had taken down the impugned article from their website in compliance with the interim injunction the applicant reiterated that the press wa one of the mean by which politician and public opinion could verify that judge were discharging their heavy responsibility in a manner that wa in conformity with the aim which wa the basis of the task entrusted to them citing prager and oberschlick ii the government the government did not contest that there had been an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression they submitted however that it had been prescribed by law namely by section and of the press act section and of the information act and article of the ccu they further stated that this lawful interference had pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation or right of others and of the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a to whether it had been necessary in a democratic society the government noted that the applicant had clearly been of the opinion that the statement published in the eighth and ninth paragraph of the article had been fact and not value judgment this had been proved by the applicant stance in the domestic proceeding in which he had argued that the court should have examined the evidence in support provided by ch and in his application to the court in which he had maintained that he had thoroughly and diligently verified all the fact provided by ch in addition in his appeal of november the applicant had stated that the information provided by ch wa trueaccurate since it had been provided by an official the government further considered that by virtue of article of the ccu see paragraph above one of the element of the offence wa dissemination of information about a person which would enable an observer to deduce that it concerned a specific identifiable individual or at least that the person belonged to a group of people to whom such information pertained indication of the person name wa not obligatory for information to be considered a concerning a specific person if he or she wa identifiable on the basis of other element in that respect they noted that the claimant worked a judge in the domestic court explicitly mentioned in the article that the information about judge examining case had not been restricted and copy had been sent to the party in the dispute and thus an unrestricted number of people could have been aware of it the government reiterated that the court the guarantor of justice whose role wa fundamental in a state based on the rule of law had to enjoy public confidence they had accordingly to be protected from destructive attack that were unfounded especially in view of the fact that judge were subject to a duty of discretion that precluded them from replying to criticism citing de haes and gijsels v belgium february report i the government then referred to the domestic court finding that the specific term and statement used by the author in the eighth and ninth paragraph of the article had suggested criminal activity at the court in question the government also referred to the case of vitrenko and others v ukraine dec no december in which the court had concluded that the term thief wa not a mere value judgment but an untrue statement of fact since it ordinarily suggested involvement in criminal activity and therefore it wa most likely that this would be the meaning understood by the public they also briefly referred to the petrovskyy local court finding that the relevant paragraph of the article contained element of an interview and thus pursuant to section of the copyright and related right act the applicant and ch a an interviewer and interviewee had coauthored the article in question they further noted without providing any further detail or referring to any document that the local administration of the state security service of ukraine upon revision of information contained in the chs letter had later found no proof of the chs allegation a to the existence and activity of an organised criminal group in the court in question therefore the factual statement had not been proved and accordingly they were untrue the government also noted that there were no ground for exempting the applicant from liability under section of the press act since ch wa not an official of a state body finally the government maintained that the above interference had also been proportionate a the domestic court had allowed the claim only in part furthermore they had reduced the fine in respect of the court fee and fee for legal aid in addition the applicant had never challenged the amount of the damage awarded before the domestic court they also submitted that the retraction penalty had been proportionate since providing an opportunity to rebut the accusation in the same forum where they had been made could reasonably be considered to be in line with the principle established in the court caselaw they referred to vitrenko and others cited aboveb the court assessmenti whether there ha been an interference the court find that holding the applicant liable for the publication of the impugned article constituted an interference with his right to freedom of expression it is also not in dispute between the party the court further note that the applicant a journalist wa held civilly liable for an article published in a newspaper the interference must therefore be seen in the context of the essential role of a free press in ensuring the proper functioning of a democratic society see among many other authority lindon otchakovsky laurens and july cited above ii whether the interference wa prescribed by law the court note that the government and the domestic court in their decision in the defamation proceeding relied on section and of the press act section and of the information act and article of the ccu see paragraph and above those provision envisaged both the penalty of retraction of inaccurate information and compensation in respect of damage caused thereby the court considers therefore that the interference at issue wa prescribed by law namely the relevant provision of the press act and information act see paragraph and above and that the applicant submission regarding alleged lack of clarity on some of the relevant point see paragraph above concern question which may arise in the analysis of the interference necessity in a democratic societyiii whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim the domestic court deciding on claim that the publication of the relevant excerpt of the article had infringed the claimant reputation a well a the authority and impartiality of the judiciary at large relied on the law protecting individual from defamation and prescribing liability for defamation of the honour and dignity of others the court accepts that the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression pursued the legitimate aim of protection of the reputation or the right of others and maintaining the authority of the judiciary see paragraph above it remains to be determined whether that interference wa necessary in a democratic societyiv necessary in a democratic societyα relevant caselaw principle regarding the defamation proceeding in order to determine whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society the court must ascertain whether it met a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article of the convention see perinçek cited above and peruzzi v italy no june the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not however to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article of the convention the decision they have delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation see fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i in particular the court must determine whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify the interference are relevant and sufficient and whether the interference wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued see chauvy and others v france no echr vi and in so doing the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority basing their decision on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article of the convention see perinçek cited above peruzzi cited above and the reference therein the court reiterates that in assessing the proportionality of the interference the nature and severity of the sanction imposed are also factor to be taken into account a the court ha previously pointed out interference with freedom of expression may have a chilling effect on the exercise of that freedom the relatively moderate nature of a criminal fine see mor v france no december doe not suffice to negate the risk of a chilling effect on the exercise of freedom of expression generally speaking while it is legitimate for the institution of the state a guarantor of the institutional public order to be protected by the competent authority the dominant position occupied by those institution requires the authority to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceeding see morice cited above with further referencesβ criterion relevant for the balancing exercise between the applicant right to freedom of expression and the necessity to maintain the authority of the judiciary the court ha previously identified a number of criterion which are relevant when balancing the right to freedom of expression against the necessity to maintain the authority of the judiciary see for instance benitez moriana and iñigo fernandez v spain no and and march and which are to be applied by the domestic court see goryaynova v ukraine no october the court considers the following criterion relevant to the examination of the particular circumstance of the present case i contribution to a debate on a matter of public interest ii nature of the impugned publication and reasoning of the domestic court iii nature and severity of the penalty imposed accordingly the court will now proceed to analyse the abovementioned criterion in the light of reasoning provided by the domestic court in their decision contribution to a debate on a matter of public interest the court first observes that the article in question including the statement in paragraph and discussed alleged practice of bribery at the domestic court a topic which wa clearly of legitimate interest to the general public but at the same time if treated in a defamatory manner wa capable of undermining the authority of the judiciary the court reiterates that question concerning the functioning of the judiciary fall within the public interest so a high level of protection of freedom of expression with the authority thus having a particularly narrow margin of appreciation will normally be accorded on the other hand judge must be protected from destructive attack and the authority of the judiciary should be maintained see paragraph and above the court note that in the present case the domestic court did not examine at all whether the publication concerned an issue of public interest concentrating solely on the veracity of the impugned statement and the harm to the judge reputation in this respect the court observes that paragraph and specifically mentioned two court the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal where all of the claimant worked a judge the court agrees that the statement used by the author in paragraph and suggested the existence of illegal practice in the aforementioned court which could constitute criminal offence given the seriousness of the allegation those statement were capable of undermining the authority of the judiciary however by omitting to analyse the importance of the issue of public interest in the dispute the domestic court failed to take into consideration the essential function that the press fulfils in a democratic society see among many other authority lindon otchakovsky laurens and july cited above and engage in a balancing exercise regarding the need to maintain the authority of the judiciary such analysis wa of particular importance given the subject matter of the publication alleged illegal judicial conduct and hence the authority of the judiciary nature of the impugned publication and reasoning of the domestic court the court observes that the applicant a journalist wa held civilly liable for an article published in a newspaper in particular the claimant stressed that the statement contained in paragraph and of the article had undermined the authority of the judiciary thus in their decision the domestic court relied heavily on the finding that the impugned statement were not value judgment but consisted of factual information while mindful of the need to make a careful distinction between statement of fact and value judgment see cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no echr xi the court considers that the thrust of the present case is not the distinction between statement of fact and value judgment a such but the fact that the applicant wa found liable for having reported the opinion of a third party namely ch see novaya gazeta and milashina v russia no october the court take note that paragraph of the article began with the phrase by the way ch conducted an investigation and came to the conclusion that it continued with the phrase in a letter to the ch set out and a proof ch cited framing the very statement that constituted the subject matter of the defamation proceeding the court therefore concludes that the above paragraph consisted of the applicant reporting on chs action and opinion a to paragraph of the article the court attache importance to the fact that it wa published a wa indeed established by the domestic court see paragraph above in the form of an interview given that the paragraph in issue started with a direct quote of ch the reason for my address to the verkhovna rada said ch wa case no and taking note of the wording that follows the author simply reproduced the statement made by ch indeed at the court hearing ch confirmed that the statement were based on information provided by him see paragraph above the court reiterates that the punishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statement made by another person in an interview would seriously hamper a contribution of the press to discussion of matter of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reason for doing so see jersild v denmark september series a no the court further note that news reporting based on interview or reproducing the statement of others whether edited or not constitutes one of the most important mean whereby the press is able to play it vital role of public watchdog see for instance observer and guardian cited above in such case a distinction need to be made according to whether the statement emanate from the journalist or are quotation from others see thorgeir thorgeirson cited above jersild cited above and pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi taking note of the above caselaw the court observes that in the present case the domestic court failed to distinguish between the statement made by ch and the reporting of such statement by the applicant by not having elaborated on whether the applicant could be held responsible under the relevant law for relaying that person statement while making it clear who the author wa see paragraph above a a result the applicant wa held liable for the statement that did not emanate from him but were clearly identified a proffered by another person see gazeta ukraina tsentr cited above the court further note that the concept of responsible journalism requires that journalist check the accuracy and reliability of information provided to the public to a reasonable extent a well a comply with the law while carrying out their professional activity see paragraph above the court point out that it wa not alleged that the applicant had obtained the information in question by unlawful mean the domestic court concluded that the applicant had failed to verify the information contained in the impugned statement before it publication and had thus failed to comply with his journalistic duty see paragraph above however in both his written submission and at the hearing before the domestic court the applicant submitted that before publication of the article he had checked that the letter containing the statement and opinion expressed by ch had indeed been sent by the latter to the competent state authority see paragraph above in addition chs allegation were corroborated with the case file material of several case examined by the court mentioned in the article and the applicant had discovered this in the context of his own journalistic investigation publishing a series of analytical article on the subject see paragraph above the applicant submitted copy of these material to the court examining the defamation claim nonetheless the domestic court failed to provide adequate reasoning while dismissing in a very formalistic manner the applicant argument in this regard see paragraph above the domestic court referred to the fact that upon examination of chs allegation by the state security service no proof of the existence of criminal activity in the court in question had been found see paragraph above however they did not provide any important detail a to the scope of such examination did not rely on any document and importantly did not clarify the relevance of the examination of chs allegation by the state security service which postdated the impugned publication to the applicant liability for defamation for having reported chs statement the court note that in view of the applicant submission before the domestic court it could be concluded that since in paragraph and of the impugned publication he had reported on the chs allegation brought before the domestic authority the applicant had duly verified the fact that ch had indeed made such allegation the court find that the domestic court did not provide relevant and sufficient reasoning demonstrating that the applicant had not acted with the due diligence expected of a responsible journalist reporting on a matter of public interest see erla hlynsdόttir v iceland no july and björk eiðsdóttir v iceland no july or specified any action that had been expected from the applicant a a journalist in such circumstance nature and severity of the penalty imposed the court observes that the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are further factor to be considered when assessing the proportionality of an interference furthermore the court must be satisfied that the penalty doe not amount to a form of censorship intended to discourage the press from expressing criticism in the context of a debate on a topic of public interest such a sanction is likely to deter journalist from contributing to public discussion of issue affecting the life of the community by the same token it is liable to hamper the press in performing it task a purveyor of information and public watchdog see bédat cited above the court observes that in the present case the applicant wa ordered to pay eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage while this amount undoubtedly wa not unusually high it wa not symbolic or insignificant in ukraine at the relevant time furthermore the domestic court ordered the removal of the article from the website and the publication of a retraction the court reiterates that where fine are concerned the relatively moderate nature of this type of sanction would not suffice to negate the risk of a chilling effect on the exercise of the right to freedom of expression see morice cited above in these circumstance the fact that the proceeding were civil rather than criminal in nature and that the amount of compensation which the applicant wa ordered to pay wa relatively moderate doe not diminish the importance of the failure by the domestic court to base their decision on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact and to adduce relevant and sufficient reason that brings the court to the conclusion that the interference complained of wa not necessary in a democratic society see for a similar finding godlevskiy v russia no october conclusion the afore mentioned lead the court to conclude that the reason that the domestic court adduced to justify the interference with the applicant right were not relevant and sufficient in particular due to their failure to address key element of the case the court further find that the domestic court can not be said to have applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article or to have based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see cumhuriyet vakfı and others cited above and ringier axel springer slovakia a v slovakia no no january the court is therefore not satisfied that the domestic court performed a balancing exercise between the conflicting interest in the light of the abovementioned factor it follows that the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression wa not necessary in a democratic society accordingly there ha been a violation of article of the convention on account of the domestic court decision in the defamation proceeding other alleged violation of the convention the applicant also complained under article and article of the convention and article of protocol no to the convention of the unfairness of the court proceeding of a violation of his intellectual property right and of professional discrimination the court ha examined the remainder of the applicant complaint and considers that in the light of all the material in it possession and in so far a the matter complained of are within it competence they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the right and freedom set out in the convention or it protocol it follows that this part of the application must be rejected a being manifestly illfounded pursuant to article and of the convention application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court find that there ha been a violation of the convention or the protocol thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party damage the applicant claimed euro eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage he stated that considerable harm had been done to his journalistic reputation a a result of the decision of the domestic court and he had been ostracised and discredited in professional circle and that the newspaper had terminated it working relationship with him and he had been unable to get offer from other employer he stated that he had been in a state of depression and psychological stress he relied on the income he would have received from the newspaper had they not terminated his contract between and the government contested those claim considering them unsubstantiated and exorbitant they noted that the applicant had failed to demonstrate a direct causal link between the termination of his employment and the domestic proceeding in question or with the loss of future income referring to the court decision in ilhan v turkey gc no echr vii they considered that the applicant claim were of a largely speculative nature they also considered the rest of his claim in this respect unsubstantiated the court ruling on an equitable basis award the applicant eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage plus any tax that may be chargeable cost and expense the applicant also claimed ukrainian hryvnia the equivalent of eur at the material time in respect of his expense for legal assistance translation and postage the government contested those claim noting that the applicant had failed to provide any document in respect of legal assistance he had allegedly received such a a power of attorney or a contract for legal assistance a to translation expense the government noted that the receipt provided by the applicant did not prove that the respective amount had been paid for translation service in the context of the proceeding before the court lastly the government noted that the applicant had submitted supporting document only in respect of part of the postal expense claimed by him according to the court caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of cost and expense only in so far a it ha been shown that these were actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable a to quantum in the present case regard being had to the document in it possession and the above criterion the court considers it reasonable to award the sum of eur in respect of postal and translation expense for the proceeding before the court plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant default interest the court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the european central bank to which should be added three percentage point for these reason the court unanimouslydeclares the complaint under article of the convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention on

democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that claim a admissibility seizure of copy of the book on september the court observes that on september an interim order for the seizure of copy of the book wa made and that on october the applicant application to set aside the order of september wa rejected the present application on the other hand wa lodged on september accordingly this part of the application ha been lodged out of time and must be rejected in accordance with article and of the convention criminal proceeding brought against the applicant the government claimed that the applicant did not have victim status within the meaning of article of the convention a he had not been convicted at the end of the proceeding the court considers that the government objection regarding the applicant lack of victim status is closely linked to the merit of his complaint under this head it therefore join this issue to the merit the court further note that this part of the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission the government submitted that the applicant could not claim to be a victim a the proceeding against him had become timebarred they therefore argued that there had been no interference with the applicant freedom of expression alternatively they submitted that the applicant had been prosecuted pursuant to section of law no and thus the interference if any had been prescribed by law they further submitted that the domestic authority had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting public order and national security the government lastly submitted that the interference had been necessary in a democratic society given that the content of the book in question had promoted hatred hostility the use of arm militancy and revenge the applicant submitted that his trial which had lasted for more than seven year and which had resulted in his being convicted under section of law no had amounted to an interference with his right guaranteed under article of the convention he also claimed that the interference in question had not been necessary in a democratic society in that respect he submitted that the book in question wa like an historical novel and that read in it entirety it did not incite violence the court assessmenta whether there wa an interference the court note at the outset that it ha already examined and rejected a similar objection by the government to the admissibility in the case of dilipak v turkey no september the circumstance of which were similar to the present case the court find no reason which would require it to reach a different conclusion in the present case in particular criminal charge were pending against the applicant for a considerable length of time and he could not be sure that he would not face further legal consequence if he a a publisher published other book on similar matter either during those criminal proceeding or at any future stage the court considers that the seven and a half year of criminal proceeding conducted against the applicant in view of the chilling effect which those proceeding may well have caused can not be viewed a solely comprising purely hypothetical risk to the applicant and considers that they constituted genuine and effective restriction per se the declaration that the proceeding had become timebarred merely put an end to the abovementioned risk but did not alter the fact that those risk had put the applicant under pressure for a substantial period of time ibid and see also semir güzel v turkey no september accordingly the court reject the government objection and find that the criminal proceeding in question constituted an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression a secured by article of the conventionb whether the interference wa justified the court note that it is not disputed between the party that the interference wa prescribed by law the dispute in the present case concern the question whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim and whether it wa necessary in a democratic society agit demir v turkey no february the court is prepared to accept that in the instant case the national authority may be considered to have pursued the legitimate aim of protecting national security and preventing disorder and crime see faruk temel v turkey no february a regard the necessity of the interference in a democratic society the court reiterates the basic principle laid down in it judgment concerning article see for example sürek v turkey no gc no echr iv şener v turkey no july and bédat v switzerland gc no echr the court considers that the principle contained in the abovementioned judgment pertaining to the medium also apply to the publication of book in general or written text other than the periodical press see association ekin v france no echr viii and çamyar and berktaş v turkey no february it will examine the present case in the light of the above principle the court observes that the book consists of seventeen chapter written by seventeen member of the pkk who had been involved in that organisation armed activity in the chapter the author convey the detail of their daily life in camp and rural area in different region of turkey and iraq their experience with local people their interaction with other member of the pkk a well a their political opinion and emotion in the court view given that serious disturbance have occurred between the security force and member of the pkk since approximately involving a very heavy loss of life and the imposition of emergency rule in much of the southeast of turkey for many year it may be concluded that the book may be considered to contain issue of public concern hence in the court view publication of a book describing the life of pkk member per se doe not run counter to the value of a democratic society in that connection the court observes that the applicant wa not charged with disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk because he had published the book in question but because the judicial authority considered that certain passage in the book constituted propaganda in favour of that organisation a a matter of fact a number of passage contained in the book were cited in both the bill of indictment and the firstinstance court judgment of march and june and the applicant wa prosecuted on the basis of the content of those passage the court must have particular regard to the impugned passage and the context in which they were published with regard to the context it will also take into account the background to the case submitted to it described in paragraph above see among many others sürek no cited above başkaya and okçuoğlu v turkey gc no and echr iv cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no echr xi and demirel and ateş v turkey no no december the court note that the common factor in most of the passage cited and referred to by the public prosecutor the istanbul state security court and the istanbul assize court is the author reference in those passage to either abdullah öcalan the leader of the pkk being the president or the member of the security force being enemy in the court view those passage can not be construed a encouraging violence armed resistance or an uprising however the court observes that three passage in the book namely the preface and the passage on page and cited in the judgment of june see paragraph above clearly glorify the use of armed force and praise deadly violence in particular in the preface the result of the war are presented a valuable and the death of member of the pkk are romanticised on page the destruction of the security force vehicle wa announced a very good news and the author express his desire to get in a good shot lastly on page an armed clash between the pkk and the security force wa described a an enjoyable event hence the court find that the domestic authority assessment that the passage in question constituted incitement to violence and to other method of terrorism wa reasonable indeed the message which wa communicated to the reader in those part is that recourse to violence is necessary satisfactory and even pleasant see mutatis mutandis sürek no cited above the court note that the passage on page and were not written by the applicant the author of the preface on the other hand is not known a there is no signature however given that the book wa edited by bk it is possible to assume that the preface wa written by him while it is true that there is nothing in the case file showing that the applicant personally associated himself with the view contained in the preface and on page and he nevertheless provided the writer with an outlet for stirring up violence see sürek v turkey no gc no july he wa the owner and editorinchief and a such had the power to shape the editorial direction of the book for that reason he wa vicariously subject to the duty and responsibility which author take on when they disseminate their writing to the public and which assume an even greater importance in situation of conflict and tension see sürek no cited above sürek no cited above halis doğan v turkey no no october and saygılı and falakaoğlu v turkey no no february lastly the court note that although not decisive the criminal proceeding against the applicant were terminated a timebarred and that there wa no final conviction nor wa he detained on remand or made to serve any prison sentence in the context of the proceeding in question against this background the court find that the criminal proceeding brought against the applicant a the owner and editorinchief of aram basım ve yayıncılık for publishing the book could reasonably be regarded a answering a pressing social need being proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and thus being necessary in a democratic society there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the length of the proceeding wa incompatible with the reasonable time requirement laid down in article of the convention which in so far a relevant provides in the determination of any criminal charge against him everyone is entitled to a hearing within a reasonable time by a tribunal the government contested that claim a admissibility the court observes at the outset that a new domestic remedy ha been established in turkey since the application of the pilot judgment procedure in the case of ümmühan kaplan v turkey no march the court observes that it declared a new application inadmissible in it decision in the case of turgut and others v turkey no march on the ground that the applicant had failed to exhaust the domestic remedy that is to say the new remedy established under law no in doing so the court considered in particular that this new remedy wa a priori accessible and capable of offering a reasonable prospect of redress for complaint concerning the length of proceeding the court further point out that in it judgment in the case of ümmühan kaplan cited above it stressed that it could nevertheless pursue the examination of such application under the normal procedure in case which had already been communicated to the government prior to the entry into force of the new remedy it further note that in the present case the government did not raise an objection in respect of the new domestic remedy in view of the above the court decides to pursue the examination of the present complaint see rifat demir v turkey no june the court note that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the government submitted that that the length of the proceeding could not be considered unreasonable the applicant reiterated that the criminal proceeding against him had not been concluded within a reasonable time the court observes that the period to be taken into consideration began on september at the latest with the istanbul state security court granting the public prosecutor request for the seizure of copy of the book and ended on april when the istanbul assize court decided to discontinue the proceeding against the applicant it thus lasted for more than seven year and six month over two level of jurisdiction the court note that the case wa not particularly complex furthermore no delay can be imputed to the applicant a to the conduct of the authority the court observes that it took both the istanbul assize court and the beyoğlu criminal court month to rule on the jurisdiction issue besides following the second judgment given by the firstinstance court on june the court of cassations examination of the appeal lasted more than two year and seven month the court ha frequently found violation of article of the convention in case raising issue similar to the one in the present case having examined all the material submitted to it the court considers that the government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case having regard to it caselaw on the subject the court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceeding wa excessive and failed to meet the reasonable time requirement daneshpayeh v turkey no july and yavuz and yaylalı v turkey no december there ha accordingly been a breach of article of the convention iii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that there wa no effective remedy under domestic law whereby he could have contested the length of the proceeding brought against him article read everyone whose right and freedom a set forth in the convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation ha been committed by person acting in an official capacity the government contested that claim a admissibility the court note that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the government did not make any submission under this head the applicant reiterated his complaint the court ha examined similar issue in previous application and ha found violation of article of the convention in respect of the lack of an effective remedy under turkish law whereby the applicant could have contested the length of the proceeding at issue see daneshpayeh cited above ümmühan kaplan cited above and gürbüz and özçelik v turkey no and february it find no reason to depart from that conclusion in the present case the court accordingly concludes that there ha been a violation of article of the convention iv application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court find that there ha been a violation of the convention or the protocol thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to

cost and expense the applicant also claimed turkish lira try approximately eur for cost and expense incurred before the court in support of his claim the applicant submitted a receipt showing that he had paid his representative eur for his representation before the court the government contested that claim in accordance with the court caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of cost

possession and the above criterion the court considers it reasonable to award the sum of eur covering cost for the proceeding before the court c default interest the court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the european central bank to which should be added three percentage point for these reason the court unanimously join to the merit the government objection regarding the applicant lack of victim status under article of the convention and dismisses it declares the complaint concerning the alleged breach of article of the

relevant international material according to the resolution of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on the functioning of democratic institution in armenia the presidential election involved a political crisis in armenia the resolution state inter alia that the parliamentary assembly regret that the violation and shortcoming observed did nothing to restore the currently lacking public confidence in the electoral process and raised question among a part of the armenian public with regard to the credibility of the outcome of the election this lack of public confidence wa the basis for the peaceful protest held without prior official notification that ensued after the announcement of the preliminary result and which were tolerated by the authority for ten day the assembly deplores the clash between the police and the protester and the escalation of violence on march which resulted in death and about people being injured the exact circumstance that led to the tragic event of march a well a the manner in which they were handled by the authority including the imposition of a state of emergency in yerevan from to march and the alleged excessive use of force by the police are issue of considerable controversy and should be the subject of a credible independent investigation the assembly condemns the arrest and continuing detention of score of person including more than opposition supporter and three member of parliament some of them on seemingly artificial and politically motivated charge this constitutes a de facto crackdown on the opposition by the authority while the outbreak of public resentment culminating in the tragic event of march may have been unexpected the assembly belief that the underlying cause of the crisis are deeply rooted in the failure of the key institution of the state to perform their function in full compliance with democratic standard and the principle of the rule of law and the protection of human right the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that their dismissal from office following their statement in the medium had violated their right to freedom of expression under article of the convention article of the convention read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the court note that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submissionsa the applicant a regard the lawfulness of the interference with their freedom of expression the applicant agreed that the diplomatic service act had met the requirement of accessibility but argued that it had lacked sufficient precision and foreseeability section subsection point c of the act referred to other political activity which wa vague a a term and the adjective political had been given an extremely broad scope involving practically any activity in the applicant social and professional environment the way the provision wa phrased at the material time all element mentioned in it had to exist in order for it to become applicable it could not therefore have been applied in the present case in which all required element did not exist it wa only after the amendment of the act in that the existence of a single element made the provision applicable moreover the provision had lacked foreseeability a it had not been applied to anyone before the applicant and it wa therefore not known how it would be interpreted the interference with the applicant freedom of expression had thus not been prescribed by law a section subsection point c of the diplomatic service act had lacked precision and foreseeability on the other hand the applicant agreed that the interference had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting national security and public safety a well a preventing disorder a to the necessity in a democratic society the applicant maintained that their statement had been of strictly neutral political content and that it had aimed to achieve value enshrined in the constitution and in the international treaty binding on armenia it had not been intended to support any political party the applicant had drafted the statement a citizen of armenia and not in their official capacity the fact that the first applicant had received the statement of several ambassador in his electronic mail could not be held against him a he had only been a passive receiver the interference had not been proportionate a section subsection point c of the diplomatic service act had been applied to the applicant selectively and without all required statutory element being present the applicant argued that the reason relied on by the government had not been relevant to justify the interference with the applicant freedom of expression and to show that it had been necessary in a democratic society it had been disproportionate to the aim pursuedb the government the government maintained that the applicant dismissal from their post following their statement of february wa compatible with article of the convention their dismissal wa prescribed by law a it had been based in particular on section subsection point j of the diplomatic service act which provided that a diplomat should be dismissed from office if he violated any of the restriction prescribed in section of the act one of those restriction wa that a diplomat had no right to use his official capacity and work facility for the benefit of political party or nongovernmental organisation or in order to carry out other political or religious activity contrary to what the applicant claimed at the relevant time the existence of a single element made the provision applicable this act wa both accessible and foreseeable and the notion used in it were sufficiently clear the act had been designed to cover relation within the diplomatic service and it wa thus designed for professional the applicant had had from to year professional experience a member of diplomatic corp had they been uncertain about the content of the act they could have sought advice from the ministry of foreign affair taking into consideration the applicant position and professional experience they had to be aware of the legal framework regulating their service including the restriction they had also been well aware of the political situation in armenia the character of their public statement and it possible impact the applicant could and must have foreseen the consequence of their statement especially a the ambassador who had issued the original statement had been dismissed from their post the day before and their dismissal had been widely reported in the medium the government argued that the applicant dismissal pursued a legitimate aim namely the aim of guaranteeing the neutrality of civil servant including diplomatic corp the restriction provided in section subsection point c of the diplomatic service act had the legitimate aim of establishing a professional diplomatic service which would not be politically loaded would not endure impact from any political force and would not depend on internal political development and change in political conjuncture the aim wa thus to uphold democracy and to protect national security in a newly independent country a to the necessity in a democratic society the government maintained that the interference had been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and that the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it had been relevant and sufficient the applicant statement had had political content and it could have had a negative effect on armenia international reputation in their statement the applicant had assessed a political process supported a political line of a political force and put in question the presidential election of they had carried out this political activity using their name and position in particular any public statement made by the first applicant who wa the press secretary to the foreign minister could potentially be perceived a the official position of the ministry diplomat were completely free in their political opinion a long a these were not pronounced publicly moreover the statement had also been discussed in the medium and this had impaired the political neutrality and reputation of the diplomatic staff of the ministry of foreign affair the interference wa thus necessary in a democratic society the court assessmenta whether there wa an interference the court note that even though neither of the party took a specific stand on the issue of whether there had been an interference within the meaning of article of the convention the court find it that the applicant dismissal from their post a a result of their statement issued on february clearly constituted an interference with their right to freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the conventionb whether it wa prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim the court note that according to the government the impugned measure had a basis in armenian law in particular in section subsection point j and of the diplomatic service act which provision were both accessible and foreseeable and the notion used in them were sufficiently clear moreover the interference complained of pursued a legitimate aim namely the aim of guaranteeing the neutrality of civil servant including diplomatic corp the applicant agreed that the diplomatic service act had been accessible but argued that it had lacked sufficient precision and foreseeability however they agreed that the interference had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting national security and public safety a well a preventing disorder the court reiterates that freedom of expression is subject to the exception set out in article of the convention the court accepts that in the present case the interference wa based on section subsection point j and of the diplomatic service act a in force at the relevant time and that these provision were accessible the party view however diverge a far a the precision and foreseeability of the said provision are concerned the court must thus examine whether the provision in question fulfil the precision and foreseeability requirement a norm can not be regarded a a law unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the individual to regulate his conduct he must be able if need be with appropriate advice to foresee to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstance the consequence which a given action may entail those consequence need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty experience show this to be unattainable again whilst certainty is highly desirable it may entail excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstance accordingly many law are inevitably couched in term which to a greater or lesser extent are vague and whose interpretation and application are a question of practice see sunday time v the united kingdom no april series a no and mutatis mutandis kokkinakis v greece may series a no a a concern the provision in question at the relevant time the court find no ambiguity in the content of section subsection point j of the diplomatic service act it clearly provides that a diplomat shall be dismissed from office if he violates the restriction enumerated in section of the act a regard section subsection point c of the act the court note that the administrative court seems to have qualified the applicant act both a falling into the category of other political activity and a falling under the use of official capacity and work facility for the benefit of party and nongovernmental organisation the court find that the latter category is sufficiently clearly worded for the purpose of article of the convention a to other political activity it is true that this formulation is more vague however it is apparent that the purpose of this general clause is to capture all other possible situation to which the provision may apply and which have not been specifically enumerated in the provision the court observes that the precision of the term other political activity is also connected to it foreseeability however even if it were true that at the relevant time in february there wa no caselaw concerning the interpretation of section subsection point c of the diplomatic service act the court find that the possibility that a diplomat could be dismissed on the basis of other political activity can not be regarded a unforeseeable the act wa enacted to cover professional conduct of diplomat who formed a specific and restricted group at the time of the impugned event the act had been in force for several year the court agrees with the government that the applicant who were all professional diplomat and who had worked in this field for more than year could not therefore claim to be ignorant of the content of the said provision had they had doubt about the exact scope of the provision in question they should either have sought advice about it content or refrained from issuing their statement moreover it appears that those ambassador who had issued the original statement only a day before were consequently dismissed from their post on the basis of the same provision although the fact that they had been dismissed may not have been known to the applicant at the relevant time they must have held it possible that such interpretation of the provision in question could be foreseeable it must therefore be concluded that section subsection point c of the diplomatic service act wa sufficiently clearly formulated in order to fulfil the requirement of precision and foreseeability under article of the convention moreover the applicant also claimed that the application of section subsection point c of the diplomatic service act to their case had been erroneous a all element required for it application did not exist the court reiterates that it is not it function to deal with error of fact or law allegedly made by a national court unless and insofar a they may have infringed right and freedom protected by the convention see mutatis mutandis garcía ruiz v spain gc no echr i in the present case there is no indication that the domestic court in their interpretation and application of the relevant law went beyond the margin allowed to them under the convention the court therefore concludes that the impugned interference wa prescribed by law in addition it ha not been disputed that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting national security and public safety a well a preventing disorder within the meaning of article see paragraph and abovec whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic societyi general principle the court reiterates that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of that pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society freedom of expression a enshrined in article is subject to a number of exception which however must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restriction must be convincingly established see for example handyside v the united kingdom december series a no lingens v austria july series a no and jersild v denmark september series a no the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with a european supervision embracing both the law and the decision applying it even those given by independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient see the sunday time v the united kingdom no november series a no in so doing the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they based their decision on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see jersild v denmark cited above while the court ha admitted that it is legitimate for a state to impose on civil servant on account of their status a duty of discretion civil servant are individual and a such qualify for the protection of article of the convention see vogt v germany september series a no and baka v hungary gc no echr it therefore fall to the court having regard to the circumstance of each case to determine whether a fair balance ha been struck between an individual fundamental right to freedom of expression and the legitimate interest of a democratic state in ensuring that it civil service properly furthers the purpose enumerated in article of the convention in carrying out this review the court will bear in mind that whenever a civil servant right to freedom of expression is in issue the duty and responsibility referred to in article of the convention assume a special significance which justifies leaving to the national authority a certain margin of appreciation in determining whether the impugned interference is proportionate to the above aim see vogt cited above albayrak v turkey no january and baka cited above in this regard the court considers that measure directed at the need to preserve the political neutrality of a precise category of civil servant can in principle be considered legitimate and proportional for the purpose of article of the convention see ahmed and others v the united kingdom september report of judgment and decision vi however such a measure should not be applied in a general manner which could affect the essence of the right protected without having in mind the function and the role of the civil servant in question and in particular the circumstance of each case see mutatis mutandis küçükbalaban and kutlu v turkey no and march and dedecan and ok v turkey no and september furthermore the court ha recognised bearing in mind the role of diplomat in society that it is a legitimate aim in any democratic society to have a politically neutral body of civil servant including the diplomatic corp in view of the particular history of some contracting state the national authority of these state may so a to ensure the consolidation and maintenance of democracy consider it necessary to have constitutional safeguard to achieve this aim by restricting the freedom of civil servant to engage in political activity see mutatis mutandis rekvényi v hungary gc cited above a democratic state is thus entitled to require civil servant to be loyal to the constitutional principle on which it is founded see vogt v germany cited above the court ha found that the special bond of trust and loyalty between a civil servant and the state a employer is important in particular in case of diplomat who are especially expected to be loyal to the state this is a particularly important element in society which are in the process of building up the institution of a pluralistic democracy see mutatis mutandis rekvényi v hungary gc cited above ii application of the above principle to the present case turning to the fact of the present case the court considers that in the light of the above principle it must in it examination take account of the circumstance and the overall background against which the applicant statement were made it must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case a a whole attaching particular importance to the office held by the applicant the form and content of their statement and in particular the context in which they were made see baka cited above the court task is to determine whether the applicant dismissal corresponded to a pressing social need and whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued according to the government the applicant had in their statement assessed a political process supported a political line of a political force and put in question the presidential election of using their name and position in the government view diplomat were completely free in their political opinion a long a these were not pronounced publicly see paragraph above the applicant disagreed with the government maintaining that their statement had been of strictly neutral political content and that it had aimed to achieve value enshrined in the constitution and in the international treaty binding on armenia it had not been made in support of any political party the applicant argued that the reason relied on by the government had not been relevant to justify the interference with their freedom of expression and to show that it had been necessary in a democratic society see paragraph above the court note that in the present case the only act which wa regarded a political by the domestic court and authority and which led to the applicant dismissal from their post wa the fact that they had published the impugned statement on february a a consequence the minister for foreign affair of armenia adopted on the next day on february decree dismissing the first second and third applicant from office the fourth applicant wa dismissed from office by a similar decree on march see paragraph above at the outset the court considers it of particular importance in it assessment that all of the four applicant occupied highranking position within the ministry of foreign affair and that their name with an explicit reference to their official title appeared on the impugned statement see paragraph and above in the light of it caselaw see paragraph above the court thus considers that the respondent state in it assessment on whether to institute disciplinary proceeding and proceed with dismissal wa entitled to have regard to the requirement that highranking civil servant such a the applicant respected and ensured the special bond of trust and loyalty between them and the state in the performance of their function furthermore the court note that in their published statement of february see paragraph above the applicant made a specific reference to the statement made on the previous day by several ambassador for armenia see paragraph above explicitly stating that they joined that statement then in the applicant statement outrage wa expressed against the fraud of the election process and a demand wa put forward that urgent step be undertaken to call into life the recommendation contained in international report the court thus considers that it is not in a position to call into question the relevance of the administrative court finding see paragraph above that the applicant impugned statement concerned political process a it contained a political assessment of election and postelection event the court also note that the applicant instituted proceeding for judicial review challenging their dismissal and seeking to be reinstated in their post in it examination of the applicant claim the administrative court found that the applicant by indicating their official title in the published statement had made use of their official capacity in consequence the domestic court found that their right to freedom of expression protected by article of the constitution had not been breached in view of the limitation clause a provided for by article of the constitution in the court view this demonstrates that the domestic court took into account the applicant right to freedom of expression in it overall assessment of the applicant claim in a manner sufficiently in conformity with the requirement of the convention finally in it assessment the court attache particular importance to the overall domestic context in which the applicant published their statement under their official title that context seemingly involved a political crisis see inter alia resolution of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on the functioning of democratic institution in armenia in paragraph above the court reiterates that a civil servant enjoy the freedom to express their opinion and idea under article of the convention like all other individual see baka cited above contracting state must allow a certain space in domestic public debate even in difficult time for the participation of civil servant in particular where their experience and expertise may be conducive to an informed debate on issue of public interest and importance however the position of the applicant in the present case differs from that of the applicant in the baka case contrary to the present applicant the baka case concerned a public servant who had a specific statutory duty a president of the national council of justice to express his opinion on legislative reform affecting the judiciary see baka cited above the court recall that a it ha previously held in view of the particular history of a contracting state the national authority may so a to ensure the consolidation and maintenance of democracy consider it necessary to have constitutional safeguard to achieve the aim in a democratic society of having a politically neutral body of civil servant including the diplomatic corp by restricting the freedom of civil servant to engage in political activity see paragraph above viewing the particular circumstance of the present case a a whole the court considers that no evidence ha been adduced that could call into question the respondent state assessment in this matter a to the sanction the court considers that the dismissal of the applicant although severe did not constitute a disproportionate measure taking into account the particular circumstance of the case and the available option under domestic law against this background and taking account of all of the element described above the court find that the government have demonstrated that the measure taken against the applicant were based on relevant and sufficient ground and were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued the court accordingly find that there ha been no violation of article of the convention ii remainder of the application the applicant also complained under article of the convention that the administrative court had lacked independence and impartiality since it had failed to apply the law and to evaluate the evidence correctly besides the applicant had been denied access to a court a the court of cassation had failed to give any reason when declaring their appeal on point of law inadmissible for lack of merit the applicant further complained under article of the convention that they had been discriminated against on the ground of their political opinion having regard to the material before it the court find that the fact complained of do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the applicant right under the convention accordingly this part of the application is manifestly illfounded and must be rejected pursuant to article a and of the convention for these reason the court declares unanimously the complaint concerning article of the convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible hold by six vote to one that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on november pursuant to rule and of the rule of court abel campos mirjana lazarova trajkovska registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the following separate opinion are annexed to this judgmenta concurring opinion of judge sicilianos and mahoneyb dissenting opinion of judge lazarova trajkovska mltacconcurring opinion of judge sicilianos and mahoneywe have voted with the majority in holding that no violation of article of the convention can be found on the basis of the material before the court we would however have preferred that for the sake of clarity the judgment contain more developed reasoning on the issue of the proportionality of the interference with the applicant exercise of their freedom of expression paragraph of the judgment read a to the sanction the court considers that the dismissal of the applicant although severe did not constitute a disproportionate measure taking into account the particular circumstance of the case and the available option under the law this is a general affirmation the only specification of the ground for the conclusion arrived at being the particular circumstance of the case and the available option under the law the latter mention is presumably a reference to section of the diplomatic service act which appears to prescribe dismissal from office a the sole sanction available for misconduct contrary to section of the act see paragraph of the judgment it is difficult to understand how this feature of the law although relevant to the issue of lawfulness dealt with in paragraph of the judgment constitutes a factor indicative of the proportional nature of an individual measure taken under the law indeed in some instance it may be the inflexibility of the applicable law in not allowing for graduated sanction which is the source of disproportionality of the interference in the form of an excessively severe sanction in relation to the misconduct found by definition in every case the application of the test of proportionality whichever way it go depends on the particular circumstance of the case that being so the first ground mentioned in paragraph of the judgment merely state the obvious and doe not offer any substantive reasoning for the conclusion arrived at in our view the factor on which the authority could rely in order to provide for and impose dismissal from office a a suitable sanction for the misconduct held against the applicant are indeed adverted to the judgment at paragraph where the court outline in an introductory manner a number of factual consideration of importance for the application of the relevant convention principle to the present case thus the respondent state in it assessment on whether to institute disciplinary proceeding and proceed with dismissal wa entitled to have regard to the requirement that highranking civil servant such a the applicant respected and ensured the special bond of trust and loyalty between them and the state in the performance of their function in brief for u what make it possible for dismissal from office to be regarded a a proportionate measure is the fact that in making use of their official capacity for political purpose in a publicly disseminated statement the applicant could be taken by the state a their employer to have destroyed the special bond of trust and loyalty that they a relatively senior diplomat in the ministry of foreign affair owed to it we would therefore have preferred that some such explanation a to the proportionality of the interference with the applicant exercise of their freedom of expression be given and developed in paragraph rather than being presented in paragraph a a general introductory consideration on a second point we have noted the conclusion of the parliamentary assembly in relation to the violence that occurred in armenia in march in the wake of the disputed presidential election that wa the subject of the applicant statement this conclusion in of the parliamentary assembly resolution on the functioning of democratic institution in armenia quoted at paragraph of the judgment read while the outbreak of public resentment culminating in the tragic event of march may have been unexpected the assembly belief that the underlying cause of the crisis are deeply rooted in the failure of the key institution of the state to perform their function in full compliance with democratic standard and the principle of the rule of law and the protection of human right a demonstrated by the sad example of the totalitarian regime in power in some european state prior to and after the second world war in extreme instance not merely the active collaboration of civil servant in the commission of human right abuse by the authority but even their passivity in the face of such abuse may be condemnable in human right term the present applicant did not however claim that the fact of their case were an illustration of such an extreme instance they did not for example argue that although their political action on february might in a normally functioning democratic society a referred to in paragraph of article have been prima facie susceptible of justifying a disciplinary measure a severe a dismissal it wa nonetheless called for in defence of democratic standard and the principle of the rule of law and the protection of human right to use the word of the parliamentary assembly had the applicant adduced some such argument on the basis of sufficiently plausible material the court scrutiny of compliance with the requirement of paragraph of article would undoubtedly have been more demanding a it is the applicant submission in this connection were rather directed towards showing that their statement wa neutral and not political a such see paragraph of the judgment it is on that basis that like our colleague we have subscribed to the conclusion in paragraph of the judgment that no evidence ha been adduced that could call into question the respondent state assessment a to the necessity to restrict the applicant freedom to engage in political activity dissenting opinion of judge lazarova trajkovskai regret that i am unable to agree to a finding of no violation of article in this case in my view this case should be referred to the grand chamber freedom of expression is one of the essential foundation of a democratic society see handyside v the united kingdom judgment of december series a no although it is legitimate for a state to impose on civil servant on account of their status an obligation of discretion civil servant are individual and a such qualify for the protection of article of the convention see baka v hungary gc no echr the status of civil servant doe not deprive a person of the protection afforded by article of the convention in such case it fall to the court having regard to the circumstance of each case to determine whether a fair balance ha been struck between the fundamental right of the individual to freedom of expression and the legitimate interest of a democratic state in ensuring that it civil service properly furthers the purpose enumerated in article see vogt v germany september series a no i agree with the majority that the applicant dismissal from their post a a result of their statement published on february clearly constituted an interference with their right to freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the convention i can also agree that this interference wa prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim where i disagree with the majority is in respect of the chamber reasoning regarding the necessity and the proportionality of the impugned interference in particular in my view the administrative court did not balance the applicant right to freedom of expression under article of the convention with the interest of the state it doe not emerge from the reasoning of the administrative court what pressing social need in the present case existed to justify a proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued the protection of the state interest over the applicant right to freedom of expression moreover i disagree with the majority that the dismissal of the applicant a the most severe measure did not constitute a disproportionate measure given the particular circumstance of the case and the available option under domestic law in this connection i note that the court ha usually considered dismissal from employment to be a very harsh measure particularly when other more lenient and more appropriate disciplinary sanction could or should have been envisaged see for example in other context guja v moldova gc no echr fuentes bobo v spain no february and kudeshkina v russia no february armenian legislation provides for a variety of reprimand which can be applied to a diplomat should he or she breach diplomatic ethic starting with a warning followed by a reprimand a severe reprimand a reduction in salary and finally dismissal government decree on approving the rule of ethic of a diplomat decree no of may provided inter alia that a diplomat is obliged b not to use or abuse his professional official capacity and work facility or the information obtained when performing his official duty for personal benefit or the benefit of third person a well a for the benefit of party and nongovernmental organisation including religious one or in order to carry out other political or religious activityand thata breach of these rule shall entail disciplinary sanction it appears from the background to this case that the domestic authority did not consider the imposition of other sanction but instead proceeded instantly a a result of applicant action to their dismissal from office the effect of the applicant dismissal were severe they were deprived of the opportunity to exercise the profession for which they had a calling for which they had been trained and in which they had acquired skill and experience see vogt v germany cited above the fact that there were no real effective safeguard available to the applicant added to the severity of the sanction it seems that there wa no possibility for the applicant to appeal before the administrative organ it will be recalled in this respect that the fairness of the proceeding and the procedural guarantee afforded are also factor to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see for example kudeshkina v russia and baka v hungary both cited above in light of all the foregoing the reason put forward by the government in order to justify their interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression were not sufficient to establish convincingly that it wa necessary in a democratic society to dismiss them even taking into account the difficult political situation at the time and allowing the national authority a certain margin of appreciation to dismiss the applicant from their post a diplomat wa disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued,,,
38,the applicant wa born in and life in debrecen he is a practising lawyer and member of the békés county bar association at the material time the applicant wa appearing a the legal representative of a hunting association before the battonya district court on march he filed with the court a notice of appeal for the attention of the secondinstance békés county regional court in which he also requested this court to initiate proceeding with a view to examining the firstinstance judge competence to exercise the duty of a judge in his appeal he wrote inter alia of course we do not assume any professional incompetence on the side of the sitting judge thus the fact that he appointed a guardian ad litem despite explicit objectionis the first proof of his bias questioning whether or not the general assembly of the respondent wa entitled to suspend it session continue at a later point and call another general assembly is not a question of bias but that of clearcut professional incompetence because the judgment reflected the personal opinion of the judge and wa not based on any evidence we can not but call into question the professional competence of the sitting judge his conduct wa guided either by sympathy for the plaintiff or a dislike for the respondent and this wa also represented in the judgment in a state based on the rule of law where proceeding should be based on the constitutional independence of judge such judicial bias can not be permissible based on the above besides our request for appeal we also request the county regional court to forward our motion to the authority responsible for initiating proceeding to examine the professional incompetence of the judge the motion wa transferred to the békés county regional court whose vicepresident indicated to the békés county bar association that in his view the applicant submission should give rise to disciplinary proceeding on april the president of the bar association informed the applicant about the opening of disciplinary proceeding on april the applicant submitted his observation contesting the initiation of the disciplinary proceeding in the ensuing proceeding the szeged bar association disciplinary board dealt with the case on june it fined the applicant hungarian forint huf approximately euro eur for having committed a serious disciplinary offence on appeal on november the national bar association disciplinary board upheld this decision in essence the applicant sought judicial review on september the budapest regional court remitted the case to the disciplinary instance essentially on procedural ground in the resumed disciplinary proceeding on april the disciplinary board fined the applicant huf eur for having committed a deliberate disciplinary offence the board wa of the opinion that the expression of course we do not assume any professional incompetence on the side of the sitting judge this is not a question of bias but that of clearcut professional incompetence and we can not but call into question the professional competence of the sitting judge amounted to disrespecting the court dignity and to denying the judge the requisite respect this wa a disciplinary offence consisting of the applicant breaching the relevant ethical obligation on november the national bar association disciplinary board upheld this decision endorsing the firstinstance disciplinary board position that the tone and language of the impugned statement wa unacceptable and prejudicial to the reputation of lawyer on june the budapest regional court dismissed the applicant action challenging the disciplinary sanction the court did not agree with the applicant contention that in expressing the impugned statement he had merely exercised his procedural right that is that he had requested the exclusion of the sitting judge for bias it also found that the statement had accused the court a an institution and not merely the sitting judge of circumventing the law on april the supreme court rejected the applicant petition for review endorsing the regional court reasoning it dismissed the applicant argument that the disciplinary measure had infringed his procedural right exercised in his capacity a defence counsel to lodge a motion for bias reiterating the regional court finding the supreme court held that contrary to what the applicant had argued his notice submitted following the closing of the firstinstance proceeding see paragraph above could not possibly serve the purpose of seeking the exclusion of the sitting judge for bias it further found that in a much a the applicant request could be interpreted a initiating proceeding to have the judge professional competence examined the reason for which he had been subjected to a disciplinary measure wa not the very request but it tone ii relevant domestic law act no xi of on attorney at law provides a follows disciplinary offence section a disciplinary offence is committed by an attorneya who wrongfully breach the obligation arising from the exercise of the practice of his profession or the duty specified in the code of ethic for attorney orb whose culpable conduct not performed a part of his attorney activity diminishes the prestige of attorney a a group regulation no iii mük of the national bar association on the ethical rule and expectation pertaining to attorney profession provides a follows attorney are to maintain the dignity of official proceeding in particular the dignity of court hearing attorney are bound to respect the dignity of the court in hearing and proceeding attorney shall behave towards member of the court and other authority in compliance with the tradition of the profession by showing and demanding due honour and respect section of the act on attorney at law and section of regulation no vi mük of the national bar association provide for the following disciplinary penalty a reprimand a fine not exceeding double the amount of the fine imposed for minor offence and removal from the bar roll the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that his right to express himself freely in his capacity a an attorney had been violated in that he had been fined for a disciplinary offence for infringing the dignity of the judiciary he relied on article and of the convention the court considers that this complaint fall to be examined under article alone the relevant part of which provides a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to impart information and idea without interference by public authority the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the court note that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission the government admitted that imposing a fine for a disciplinary offence amounted to an interference with the applicant freedom of speech however they argued that the interference had been in accordance with the law pursued a legitimate aim and been necessary in a democratic society in particular the decision to fine the applicant had been based on section a of the act on attorney at law and meant to maintain the authority of the judiciary the government also considered that the interference had been proportionate to it aim for the following reason they first emphasised that the domestic court had solved the conflict between the applicant right to freedom of expression and the protection of the court dignity by weighing the relevant interest at stake in a manner reconcilable with the principle embodied in article of the convention according to the government the applicant had overstepped the limit of freedom of expression by using a tone and language disrespectful to the court dignity and by referring to the professional unfitness of the sitting judge in their view the applicant statement had also suggested that the court a a whole assisted in the circumvention of the law the government also submitted that the applicant could have used a different manner to express his dissatisfaction when filing his motion for bias he could have applied expression not injurious to the court dignity the government further argued that the nature and severity of the imposed sanction wa a factor to be taken into consideration in assessing the proportionality of the interference in the present case the applicant had sustained a fine of huf an amount which could not be considered disproportionate the applicant submitted that his remark had been expressed in a motion for bias in exercise of his procedural right under the code on civil procedure he had only intended to call attention to the performance of the sitting judge in a particular case and his motion had contained all relevant reason to substantiate his statement the court assessment the court reiterates that article is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb see for example mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no echr extract furthermore freedom of expression protects not only the substance of the idea and information expressed but also the form in which they are conveyed see for example kyprianou v cyprus gc no echr xiii and mariapori v finland no july it is not disputed between the party and the court see no reason to hold otherwise that fining the applicant for a disciplinary offence amounted to an interference with his freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the convention the court note that freedom of expression is subject to exception set out in article of the convention it observes that the interference with the applicant freedom of expression wa based on section a and of act no xi of it wa thus prescribed by law moreover it is undisputed that it pursued the legitimate aim of maintaining the authority of the judiciary within the meaning of article therefore the only question for the court to determine is whether that interference wa necessary in a democratic society in so doing the court must ascertain whether the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see among many other authority jersild v denmark september series a no and that a fair balance wa struck between on the one hand the need to protect the authority of the judiciary and on the other hand the protection of the applicant freedom of expression see žugić v croatia no may according to the court wellestablished caselaw the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with a european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court see janowski v poland gc no echr i the scope of the domestic power of appreciation is not identical a regard each of the aim listed in article the domestic law and practice of the contracting state reveal a fairly substantial measure of common ground in the area of authority of the judiciary this is reflected in a number of provision of the convention including article accordingly here a more extensive european supervision corresponds to a le discretionary power of appreciation see the sunday time v the united kingdom no april series a no the court further reiterates that the phrase authority of the judiciary includes in particular the notion that the court are and are accepted by the public at large a being the proper forum for the ascertainment of legal right and obligation and the settlement of dispute relative thereto further that the public at large have respect for and confidence in the court capacity to fulfil that function see the sunday time cited above the work of the court which are the guarantor of justice and which have a fundamental role in a state governed by the rule of law need to enjoy public confidence it should therefore be protected against unfounded attack however the court a with all other public institution are not immune from criticism and scrutiny see skałka v poland no may therefore while party are certainly entitled to comment on the administration of justice in order to protect their right their criticism must not overstep certain bound see saday v turkey no march in particular a clear distinction must be made between criticism and insult if the sole intent of any form of expression is to insult a court or member of that court an appropriate sanction would not in principle constitute a violation of article of the convention see skałka loc cit moreover the special status of lawyer give them a central position in the administration of justice a intermediary between the public and the court such a position explains the usual restriction on the conduct of member of the bar see casado coca v spain february series a no athe role of counsel to defend their client interest involves their choice on the relevance and usefulness of an argument they can find themselves in the delicate situation where they have to decide whether or not they should object to or complain about the conduct of the court keeping in mind their client best interest they might for instance feel constrained in their choice of pleading procedural motion etc during proceeding before the court possibly to the potential detriment of their client case for the public to have confidence in the administration of justice they must have confidence in the ability of the legal profession to provide effective representation it follows that any chilling effect of even a relatively light penalty is an important factor to be considered in striking the appropriate balance between court and lawyer in the context of an effective administration of justice see kyprianou v cyprus gc cited above turning to the fact of the present case the court note that in it decision of june the budapest regional court found that the applicant statement made in his notice of appeal were insulting both to the sitting judge and the court a an institution see paragraph above this finding wa endorsed by the supreme court in it decision of april adding that the reason for the disciplinary measure wa not the applicant challenging the sitting judge professional conduct a such but the tone of his submission see paragraph above the supreme court took into consideration whether the disciplinary fine actually affected the applicant right a counsel see paragraph above it found that his right to express his disagreement with the firstinstance decision and the conduct of the sitting judge had not been restricted it established that since it had been lodged after the conclusion of the firstinstance proceeding the remark contained in the notice of appeal could not be considered a a motion for bias against the firstinstance judge but only a the applicant personal opinion furthermore according to the domestic court the applicant wa not fined for having challenged the firstinstance judge competence to serve a a judge but for having used a tone for his criticism which had been injurious to the dignity of the judiciary see paragraph above the court note that the present case bear similarity to meister v germany no and commission decision of october and april respectively unreported where counsel had made insulting statement about judge and other person whom he regarded a having decided or acted incorrectly in the context of or in relation to court proceeding to wr v austria no commission decision of june unreported where counsel had described the opinion of a judge a ridiculous to mahler v germany no commission decision of january unreported where counsel had asserted that the prosecutor had drafted the bill of indictment in a state of complete intoxication to a v finland dec no january where the applicant had been issued with a warning for his statement of a disparaging nature submitted in a written appeal concerning the presiding judge to saday cited above where the accused had described the turkish judiciary a executioner dressed in gown and to žugić cited above where the applicant notice of appeal had used a langue implying that the judge a a person wa arrogant and incompetent to exercise the duty of a judge the court reiterates in this context that while lawyer are certainly entitled to comment in public on the administration of justice their criticism must not overstep certain bound in that connection account must be taken of the need to strike the right balance between the various interest involved which include the public right to receive information about question arising from judicial decision the requirement of the proper administration of justice and the dignity of the legal profession see schmidt v austria no july in the present case the applicant acted a the legal representative of a client in civil proceeding in the written submission which he prepared acting in that capacity he accused the sitting judge of professional incompetence it follows that in the circumstance of the present case the requirement of protection of the interest of the proper administration of justice and the dignity of the legal profession is not to be weighed against the interest in the open discussion of matter of public concern or freedom of the press see mutatis mutandis nikula v finland no echr ii the court also note that the impugned statement were not only a criticism of the reasoning in the judgment but a found by the disciplinary board and the domestic court amounted to belittling the sitting judge professional capacity and implied that the court in question had circumvented the law having regard to the impugned remark themselves in part sarcastic in part overtly insulting see paragraph above the court doe not find this assessment unreasonable furthermore there is nothing to suggest that the applicant could not have raised the substance of his criticism of the reasoning in the decision without using the impugned language see mutatis mutandis steur v the netherlands no echr xi where the applicant lawyer criticism of a police officer in court did not amount to a personal insult and wa strictly limited to the officer action relevant to his client case a distinct from criticism of his general professional or other quality moreover the fine complained of wa imposed on the applicant by the bar association for the breach of the ethical rule of the legal profession the court note that the applicant a a lawyer wa bound by the rule of professional conduct and find it legitimate to expect him to contribute to the proper administration of justice and thus to maintain public confidence in it see schöpfer v switzerland may report of judgment and decision iii finally in assessing the proportionality of the interference the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are also factor to be taken into account see ceylan v turkey gc no echr iv in this respect the court note that the applicant wa merely fined in an amount not excessive in the course of disciplinary proceeding which were not made public and had no consequence on his right to exercise his profession the present case can thus be distinguished from the case of nikula cited above in which a criminal sanction albeit a lenient one wa imposed on the applicant having regard to the foregoing the court considers that the reason advanced by the disciplinary board and the domestic court were sufficient and relevant to justify the interference and that the sanction imposed on the applicant wa not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued the interference can thus reasonably be considered necessary in a democratic society to protect the judiciary within the meaning of article consequently there ha been no violation of article of the convention ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant further complained that the length of the proceeding wa incompatible with the reasonable time requirement of article of the convention the government did not contest that argument the period to be taken into consideration began at the latest on april when the applicant contested the initiation of disciplinary proceeding see philis v greece no june report of judgment and decision iv and ended on april when the supreme court gave a final decision the period thus lasted some seven year for the proceeding before the bar and for two judicial instance in view of such lengthy proceeding this complaint must be declared admissible the court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceeding must be assessed in the light of the circumstance of the case and with reference to the following criterion the complexity of the case the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authority and what wa at stake for the applicant in the dispute see among many other authority frydlender v france gc no echr vii the court ha frequently found violation of article of the convention in case raising issue similar to the one in the present application see frydlender cited above having examined all the material submitted to it the court considers that the government have not put forward any fact or convincing argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present circumstance having regard to it caselaw on the subject the court find that the length of the proceeding wa excessive and failed to meet the reasonable time requirement there ha accordingly been a breach of article of the convention iii application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court find that there ha been a violation of the convention or the protocol thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party a damage the applicant claimed euro eur in respect of pecuniary damage and euro in respect of nonpecuniary damage the government left the matter to the discretion of the court the court note that it ha found a violation only in respect of the length of proceeding any compensation should therefore reflect that fact the court considers that the applicant must have suffered some nonpecuniary damage on account of the violation of his right under article of the convention and award him on the basis of equity eur under this head b cost and expense the applicant also claimed eur for the cost and expense incurred exclusively before the domestic court the government contested this claim according to the court caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of cost and expense only in so far a it ha been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable a to quantum in the present case the court note that the cost incurred in the domestic proceeding have no connection with it finding of a violation of the reasonable time requirement of article furthermore the court note that the applicant who wa not represented by a lawyer in the proceeding before the court ha not submitted any claim in connection with the convention proceeding consequently the court reject the applicant cost claim c default interest the court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the european central bank to which should be added three percentage point for these reason the court unanimously declares the application admissible hold that there ha been a violation of article of the convention hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention holdsa that the respondent state is to pay the applicant within three month from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with article of the convention eur one thousand five hundred euro in respect of nonpecuniary damage to be converted into the currency of the respondent state at the rate applicable at the date of settlementb that from the expiry of the abovementioned three month until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage point dismisses the remainder of the applicant claim for just satisfaction done in english and notified in writing on january

the applicant to remove the banner in that situation the police officer lawfully ordered him to remove the banner see paragraph and below because it display posed a real threat to public order health and life of the participant however in breach of section of the public event act see paragraph below the applicant refused to follow that order in the court view his conduct amounted to a breach of the established rule for the conduct of public event an offence under article of the code of administrative offence hereafter the cao see paragraph below the court fined the applicant for russian rouble rub equivalent to euro eur the applicant then appealed to the tsentralniy district court of novosibirsk which examined his appeal on november the court endorsed the finding of the lower court in particular it noted that the applicant had not disputed the fact of the case the court agreed with the assessment of the provocative content of the banner and with the assessment of threat to public order posed by the applicant according to the tsentralniy district court of novosibirsk the legal classification of the offence wa correct and the fine wa not disproportionate relevant legal framework the federal law on gathering meeting demonstration procession and picket no fz of june the public event act provides that the participant in a public event must comply with lawful instruction of the organiser order by the authority and by the police the participant also must maintain public order and follow the event programme section according to the public event act police

public authority the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the government submitted that the applicant had not suffered a significant disadvantage within the meaning of article b of the convention because the fine imposed on him had been modest and his case had been duly considered by the domestic court the applicant submitted that the fine irrespective of it amount constituted a disproportionate interference with his freedom of expression the court observes that the fine of eur wa indeed modest and the applicant did not advance any argument to demonstrate that it had been significant to him in the light of his personal situation the court reiterates however that a violation of the convention may concern important question of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage regardless of pecuniary interest see korolev v russia dec no july considering that the applicant wa found guilty of and fined for an act which had in his view amounted to a proper exercise of his right to freedom of expression on a matter of public interest see paragraph above the alleged violation of article of the convention in the present case concern important question of principle compare obote v russia no november and handzhiyski v bulgaria no april the court thus find that he ha suffered a significant disadvantage accordingly it dismisses the government objection pertaining to article b of the convention the court further note that the applicant complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merit submission by the party the applicant submitted that the interference with his right to freedom of expression had not been necessary in a democratic society even if his banner could have seemed provocative or shocking to some it wa not offensive for the participant or organiser of the event none of them expressed any displeasure at the sight of the banner it wa not shown that his conduct posed any threat to public order people health or life the applicant did not participate in any act of violence there had been no pressing social need to take him to a police station since the administrativeoffence report could have been drawn up on the spot the government submitted that the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression had been prescribed by law had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting public order and public safety preventing disorder and crime and protecting the right of others and had been necessary in a democratic society either the applicant had taken part in a public event that had not been notified to the authority or he had taken part in a notified and approved public event in support of the president and had used a banner that had not corresponded to the event programme and aim and wa offensive it might therefore have provoked the participant in the public event and led to public disorder indeed other participant in the event had been displeased and had asked the applicant to remove the banner the domestic court had found that displaying the banner had created a real threat to people life and health and that the police order to remove it had therefore been lawful by failing to comply with that order the applicant breached the rule for the conduct of public event the penalty imposed on him wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued the court assessmenta general principle for a summary of the relevant general principle see fáber v hungary no july b application of the general principle to the present casei existence of an interference the applicant claim that the circumstance of the case disclose an interference with his right to freedom of expression wa not questioned by the government the court find that the police order to remove the banner and the applicant conviction amounted to such interferenceii prescribed by law the court is satisfied with the lawfulness of the police order under section of the public event act the police had the power to require that the applicant refrain from any action that could have led to a breach of public order or the rule for the conduct of a public event see paragraph above the applicant conviction of a breach of the established rule for the conduct of public event under article of the cao wa based on the domestic court finding that he had violated section of the public event act that act stipulated that the participant in a public event must comply with lawful police order and maintain public order given that the failure to comply with the police order had not been contested by the applicant the court find that his conviction had a sufficient basis in domestic lawiii legitimate aim the applicant wa ordered to remove the banner and then convicted of an administrative offence because the authority considered that his banner wa provocative and could lead to disorder the court accepts that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of prevention of disorder and the protection of the right and freedom of others see fáber cited above iv necessity in a democratic society the impugned police order wa based on the consideration that the banner did not correspond to the programme of the event wa provocative and could result in unrest the applicant contested that assessment according to him the banner corresponded to the declared aim of the event and wa not offensive it demonstration did not result in a breach of public order given that the domestic court are better placed than the international judge to ass what is likely to be considered provocative and offensive by the society and that the text on the applicant banner wa ambiguous the court give credence to the finding by the domestic court that the banner could in fact be perceived a offensive by some of the participant indeed comparing mr putin with adolf hitler could be seen a something other than support for the president policy the court therefore accepts the government argument based on the assessment of the situation by the domestic authority that the display of the banner could have resulted in a conflict between the applicant and the participant in the public event that fact by itself could not however justify an interference with the fundamental right provided for by article of the convention the court ha already held that a demonstration may annoy or give offence to person opposed to the idea or claim that it is seeking to promote plattform ärzte für da leben v austria june series a no moreover it consistently underlined the importance of the right to counterdemonstration which could be held at the same time and venue with a demonstration see for example öllinger v austria no echr ix and fáber cited above july the right to counter demonstration however is not absolute a in a democracy it can not extend to inhibiting the exercise of the right to demonstrate see plattform ärzte für da leben cited above fáber cited above and berkman v russia no december moreover the contracting state have a duty to take reasonable and appropriate measure to enable lawful demonstration to proceed peacefully the united macedonian organisation ilinden and ivanov v bulgaria no october the aforementioned principle formulated in case concerning freedom of assembly are fully pertinent to the present case given that the applicant expressed his opinion during a public event bearing them in mind the court note that it ha not been shown that the police order to remove the banner wa triggered by it content a such rather a the domestic court found the police order wa triggered by the applicant conduct considered provocative by some of the participant to the event and by their negative reaction indeed the applicant chose to raise the banner in the middle of a crowd of his opponent although nothing prevented him from taking a place in an adjacent area see by contrast fáber cited above where the applicant held a counterdemonstration outside of the crowd of protestors the applicant location among the demonstrator wa a key factor the applicant banner distorted and undermined the message that other participant and the overall demonstration wanted to convey which wa in support of mr putin it also made it difficult for the police to ensure the peaceful conduct of the event when the risk of unrest started materialising in a form of a conflict between the applicant and his opponent the police invited the applicant and mr b to remove the banner the police officer were best positioned to evaluate the security risk and those of disturbance a well a the appropriate measure dictated by the risk assumption their order to remove the banner therefore doe not appear to have been unreasonable or excessive see by contrast berkman cited above where the court criticised the police inaction and can thus considered proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued the court lastly note that the applicant wa not removed from the meeting taking that into account his conviction of an administrative offence and the fine of eur which is the minimal sanction for a breach of article of the cao do not appear to be excessive see by contrast navalnyy v russia gc no and others november where the court held that the amount of fine imposed on the applicant wa immaterial if the public assembly wa dispersed by the police compare to rai and evans v the united kingdom dec no and november and ziliberberg v moldova dec no may where the imposition of fine wa not found to be a disproportionate interference with freedom of peaceful assembly in the light of the above the court concludes that the measure complained of by the applicant did not in the specific circumstance of the case go beyond what wa necessary in a democratic society there ha therefore been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the courtdeclares unanimously the application admissible hold by five vote to two that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on february pursuant to rule and of the rule of court olga chernishova george ravarani deputy registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the following separate opinion are annexed to this judgmenta сoncurring opinion of judge ravaranib joint concurring opinion of judge elósegui and zündc dissenting opinion of judge seibert fohr joined by judge pavli groc concurring opinion of judge ravarani i am in agreement with the conclusion reached by the majority of judge that in the circumstance of the case there ha been no violation of article i should like however to make clear that i reached that conclusion only because of the specificity of the known fact and moreover lacuna in the presentation of other fact which might have been relevant for the assessment of the alleged violation based on the available information it appears to me that the case wa not about i the applicant allegedly impaired right to express his opinion but rather ii his noncompliance with a legal and proportionate police order based on the risk of degeneration of the peaceful conduct of the gathering into which he had introduced himself a a matter of fact the applicant and mr b were not actually prevented from expressing their opinion at any point during the demonstration it is true a stated in paragraph of the judgment that the police invited them to remove the provocative banner but they refused to do so moreover they were able to remain in the middle of the pro putin gathering and to display their banner during the entire meeting until it very end so there actually wa no concrete impediment to expressing their opinion it is true that at some point the police invited them to remove their banner i am in agreement with the majority that there wa a genuine risk to the peaceful conduct of the event and it appears quite astonishing that only two participant in the demonstration showed discontent with the provocative banner being displayed in their midst the police did not to my mind take an unreasonable or excessive step in inviting the applicant and mr b to remove their banner on the contrary such action showed sound riskassessment it is futile to speculate on how the police would have reacted had they stepped out of the demonstration and displayed their banner outside the pro putin crowd in a quite visible way using their right to counterdemonstrate had there had been an intervention by the police in such a situation there would certainly have been an issue under that right in this context i feel obliged to distance myself from the statement contained in paragraph of the judgment according to which the applicant banner distorted and undermined the message that other participant and the overall demonstration wanted to convey which wa in support of mr putin a it is highly ambiguous and could be understood a restricting the right to counterdemonstrate which is protected by article of the convention see the reference to the court caselaw in that field in paragraph of the judgment it is also true that once the gathering wa over the police stepped in and took the applicant to the police station in order to record the administrative offence of noncompliance with a legal order it appears to me that a a matter of fact the applicant had indeed failed to abide by such an order this did not in itself impair his freedom of expression a it doe not appear from the fact that the given order wa aimed at preventing him from expressing his opinion but rather at avoiding uproar and violence a the applicant actually continued to display his banner and did not step out of the gathering had he done so and the police had nevertheless recorded an administrative offence an issue under article would certainly have arisen the fact of taking the applicant to the police station could have given rise to a violation of convention guarantee if it had been shown that it wa triggered by the content of his banner rather than by the refusal to abide by an invitation that quite legitimately tried to minimise a risk of physical violence not least directed against the applicant and mr b themselves there could also have been a convention issue if the applicant had been taken by force to the police station and been obliged to remain in the premise longer than necessary to draw up the offence record however the fact surrounding this episode are unknown or at the least unexplained see paragraph of the judgment and the applicant ha not lodged a complaint under article of the convention joint concurring opinion of judgeselósegui and zünd in the present case of manannikov v russia we have voted with the majority because we agree with the finding that there ha been no violation of article of the convention the reason for our concurring opinion is to emphasise one of the element which ought to be taken into consideration a a limitation on the right to freedom of expression namely the right of expression of other citizen we agree with the reasoning in the judgment to the effect that there is a double reason for finding no violation namely the legitimate aim of protecting the right of others and preventing a disturbance of public order our caveat is that in the current circumstance different part of the population demonstrate on an increasingly frequent basis in public space because they hold different opinion about social matter such a for instance the policy imposed by state with regard to pandemicrelated publichealth measure we are living in tense society all around europe for very different cause and reason in our view what it is important under article is that those citizen who have requested official permission to demonstrate in one or another direction should be able to do so without being hampered by other citizen who think differently in the present case the fact that the applicant mr manannikov introduced himself into the middle of an authorised demonstration distorted the message that the other participant wished to express in fact by displaying a banner stating that putin is better than hitler he changed the overall image of the demonstration which wa intended to express support for mr putin in our view this behaviour of course increased the risk of conflict but moreover it also failed to respect the right of others to freedom of expression the applicant is free to think in another way but he is not entitled to impede others from expressing their view in the way that he did the caselaw of the court ha insisted on the idea that the exercise of one individual freedom may be limited if it impedes the right of others for instance in the case of steel and others v the united kingdom september report of judgment and decision vii the first applicant together with approximately sixty others took part in a protest against a grouse shoot on wheeldale moor yorkshire ibid she wa arrested for a breach of the peace moreover according to the police she wa intentionally impeding the progress of a member of the shoot by walking in front of him a he lifted his shotgun to take aim thus preventing him from firing ibid she wa further charged with using threatening abusive or insulting word or behaviour within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment alarm or distress ibid the court found that the measure taken against her had not given rise to a violation of article we would like to emphasise that the court ha consistently underlined the importance of the right to counterdemonstration which could be held at the same time and venue a a demonstration see for example öllinger v austria no echr ix and fáber v hungary no july see paragraph of the present judgment however this right to counterdemonstration is not absolute and it ha to respect the right of others see plattform ärzte für da leben v austria june series a no fáber cited above and berkman v russia no december see also paragraph of the present judgment this wa not so in the present case a outlined in paragraph above dissenting opinion of judge seibertfohrjoined by judge pavli while we agree with the majority that there ha been an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression we come to a different conclusion with respect to it necessity whereas the contracting state enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent an interference is necessary this margin go hand in hand with european supervision when carrying out that supervision the court must ascertain whether the impugned measure are proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued due regard being had to the importance of freedom of expression in a democratic society see perinçek v switzerland gc no december in our view it ha not been shown in the present case that it wa necessary to take and hold the applicant at a police station for several hour after the demonstration had ended let alone to impose a fine on him the government have failed to demonstrate that there were no le restrictive mean at their disposal to protect public order see glor v switzerland no echr we agree with the majority that public authority may legitimately intervene in case where public order is at stake and take action in order to avoid conflict between demonstrator and counterdemonstrator a the court ha explained in ärzte für da leben v austria no june in a democracy the right to counterdemonstrate can not extend to inhibiting the exercise of the right to demonstrate genuine effective freedom of peaceful assembly can not therefore be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the state not to interfere article sometimes requires positive measure to be taken even in the sphere of relation between individual if need be therefore state may be required to take positive measure in order to protect a lawful demonstration against counterdemonstration see also öllinger v austria no june for this reason it may be necessary to take step to deescalate tension before a real risk of inflicting bodily harm materialises see berkman v russia no december what kind of measure are permissible will depend on the particular situation at hand in fáber v hungary no july the court considered that the state had had a positive obligation to protect the right of assembly of both demonstrating group by identifying the least restrictive mean that would in principle enable both demonstration to take place in the present case the authority have failed to demonstrate that the order to remove the banner followed by the imposition of a fine on the applicant wa indeed necessary to protect public order the applicant conduct wa neither threatening nor abusive he did not hinder other participant from participating or expressing their view the reason for the applicant conviction wa the fact that he displayed a banner which wa considered provocative compare fáber v hungary cited above two participant in the event were displeased by the banner and asked for it removal see paragraph of the judgment however the applicant refusal to take the banner down did not lead to any further reaction by other participant the banner continued to be displayed until the end of the event without any further incident nonetheless the police took the applicant to a police station after the meeting had ended in their submission see paragraph the government argue that the divergence from the event programme might have provoked the participant in the public event and led to public disorder however repressive measure can not be based on such hypothetical effect inviting the police to decide on their own which view are consistent with an event programme would significantly undermine the right to freedom of expression an expression which is considered to be provocative is therefore in itself insufficient to justify intervention if provocative expression do in fact lead to a disruption of the main event or to tension with other demonstrator who consider the message of the event to be distorted preventative deescalating measure need to be considered such a separating the demonstrator on site while allowing both group an opportunity to express their view see öllinger v austria cited above in the present case however the police did not consider such preventative measure to be necessary the applicant wa not directed to an adjacent area in order to avoid tension with the other participant or to prevent the alleged distortion of the event and disruption to it participant instead the police waited until the applicant wa already on his way home before sanctioning him the course of event thus contradicts the assumption that the applicant presence rendered it difficult for the police to ensure the peaceful conduct of the event we acknowledge that during a public event the police are required to determine the appropriate measure on the basis of an ex ante evaluation of the security risk and the likelihood of disturbance however this doe not absolve the authority from pointing to concrete fact such a actual disruption prior disturbance or violent act in past event in order to establish a pressing social need to prohibit the expression of an opinion moreover based on the relevant risk assessment the police need to resort to the least restrictive measure see fáber v hungary cited above we are doubtful that the discomfort experienced by two other demonstrator with regard to the banner wa sufficient to justify the order to remove it entirely rather than asking the applicant to move to an adjacent area at a sufficient distance from the demonstrator in any event once subsequent event showed that the alleged risk of disorder the assumption of which had been hasty did not materialise there were no ground for taking the applicant to the police station after the event holding him there and sentencing him to a fine for these reason and in the absence of any demonstration of a pressing social need for the applicant conviction we would have found a violation of article in the present case,,,
40,the first applicant organisation is the vienna chamber of medical doctor ärztekammer für wien the chamber represents all medical practitioner in vienna and also ha it own website the second applicant wa the chamber president at the time of the event a statement in issue and injunction proceeding on january the second applicant published a letter on the first applicant organisation website which wa addressed to all member of the chamber in vienna and wa also sent out to all of them via email the letter wa titled locust fund want to take over medical practice heuschreckenfonds wollen ordinationen übernehmen the second applicant went on to state that he had been forced to write to his colleague for a serious reason namely because it had been reported in the medium that the f company planned to go into the radiology business he added that sharebidding company planned to offer medical service initially in the area of radiology but soon enough in other area of the profession a well and that doctor risked becoming mere employee of such locust company if they would not act according to the company wish they would be dismissed the second applicant then explained the assumed legal and organisational basis of such a plan radiology service which were currently being provided by medical practice could in future also be offered by limited company share of those company could then be bought by the f company and the locust would reach their goal namely control of the medical profession giving an example of a risky development the second applicant stated that in the last year colleague had founded laboratory which had reciprocal agreement with certain health insurance board today almost all of those laboratory were owned by the f group which in turn wa owned by insurance company investment fund and foundation and which employed a large number of doctor the second applicant ended his letter by stating that he could guarantee one thing that the doctor professional representative body would make use of all legal and political mean available to stop such a disastrous development from going ahead to prevent that the quality of medical treatment being determined by manager and controller and to ensure inter alia that existing medical practice were protected from the competition from international locust fund internationale heuschreckenfonds on january the f company lodged an action against the two applicant and an application for an injunction with the vienna commercial court handelsgericht wien the applicant contested the application on february the vienna commercial court issued an injunction prohibiting the applicant each of them individually from repeating the statement that the f company wa ruthless towards third party in particular medical professional the injunction prevented the applicant from referring to the f company a a locust locust company or locust fund the applicant were further prohibited from stating that the provision of service by the f company particularly service in the area of radiology wa a disastrous development the court found that there wa a competitive relationship between the f company and the applicant and found the statement made by the applicant to be defamatory under article of the civil code and unethical under the unfair competition act bundesgesetz gegen den unlauteren wettbewerb the applicant appealed against the injunction on october the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht wien partly granted the appeal and prohibited the applicant from alleging that the f company wa ruthless towards third party and medical practitioner and from calling it inter alia a locust company however it dismissed the f company application to prohibit the applicant from calling it provision of service a disastrous development the court of appeal found that the first applicant organisation had locus standi in the injunction proceeding the chamber of medical doctor held official authority status in relation to certain area of it work bereich der hoheitsverwaltung in addition to representing the interest of it member it wa therefore considered a legal entity under the official liability act amtshaftungsgesetz however when acting a a special interest group it represented it member interest from a mainly economic perspective rather than acting in it capacity a an official authority according to the court of appeal the letter in issue pursued the interest of the chamber member outside the chamber official sphere of activity the court of appeal further established referring inter alia to wikipedia that the term locust company heuschreckenunternehmen wa introduced into the political discussion in german speaking country in by mr franz müntefering a german politician and is ever since used in political debate a a pejorative term for privateequity company or other form of capital fund with shortterm or exaggerated return expectation like hedge fund or vulture fund which also had negative connotation the domestic court found that there wa a need to balance the interest involved in the present debate reiterating that extreme opinion were only unlawful if they were excessive a a result of that balancing exercise the court of appeal found that the locust statement had to be considered a lawful criticism in the context of a public debate and that the f company could therefore not base it claim on article of the civil code however the court of appeal classified the applicant action a competitive in nature statement of fact made in violation of the unfair competition act could not be justified by the right to freedom of expression the court of appeal found that austrian law provided wideranging protection for commercial and economic interest those who published an opinion in an economically competitive context were obliged to exercise a higher level of diligence with regard to the fact and base of their allegation than those who acted in the noncompetitive context of a public debate of general interest therefore the court of appeal upheld the injunction decision with regard to the statement about the locust company however a regard the further statement namely that provision of certain service by the f company wa a disastrous development the court of appeal found that read in context the statement indicated a general assessment and did not refer to a particular service of the f company it wa therefore to be considered a personal opinion and thus a value judgment that wa not defamatory under article of the civil code it also did not fall under section of the unfair competition act the applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal with the supreme court oberster gerichtshof on january the supreme court dismissed the extraordinary appeal it acknowledged the applicant argument that where a competitor even for economic purpose took part in a debate of public interest freedom of expression had to hold more weight in the balancing test however the supreme court observed that the applicant had made their statement in the clearly economic context of competition between medical practitioner and company which provided the same service the applicant could have warned their member of the possible risk of cooperating with company without overstepping the margin of acceptable criticism however the applicant had exceeded that limit and stated that the f company wa a locust that statement wa one of fact and the applicant had not provided evidence of a factual basis for their allegation and had therefore exceeded the permissible limitation of freedom of expression b substantive proceeding on july the commercial court gave it judgment in the substantive proceeding and ordered the applicant to refrain from repeating the statement that the f company wa ruthless towards third party in particular medical practitioner and patient and stating that the f company wa a locust company a locust fund or a locust it further ordered the applicant to publish and display the operative part of the judgment on the first applicant organisation website for thirty day and to publish it in the first applicant organisation print newsletter the commercial court made substantial reference to the court of appeal reasoning in the interim injunction proceeding it followed the previous finding that the relevant statement did not constitute defamation pursuant to article of the civil code examining the statement in relation to the provision of the unfair competition act the commercial court found that the letter had been written by the chamber of medical doctor in a commercial and not a political context it had also had the advancement of independent medical practice a an objective and had contained a warning regarding capital venture which allegedly threatened doctor independence the commercial court found the relevant comparison with locust to be statement of fact regarding both the f company and it conduct in relation to third party doctor and patient the statement were also likely to damage the f company commercial interest and had not been proved to be true the used language could also not be justified with a reference to the right to freedom of expression a the statement wa uttered within the framework of a commercial competitive relationship with reference to the court caselaw allowing for a wider margin of appreciation under article of the convention with regard to commercial language the commercial court observed that a competitor wa required to be more diligent in the context of commercial communication among competitor the term locust wa almost exclusively loaded with negative meaning which led to the unethical general vilification of a competitor the applicant were therefore prohibited from using that statement in relation to the f company pursuant to the unfair competition act on september the applicant lodged an appeal against that judgment on december the vienna court of appeal dismissed the appeal a unfounded it referred to the extensive reasoning given in the interim injunction proceeding and added that according to the caselaw of the supreme court the test used to verify whether a statement wa covered by the right to freedom of expression required the assessment of whether a factual basis for such a statement existed if a competitor participated in a public debate of general interest freedom of expression had more weight with regard to the assessment of the statement than in the context of purely commercial communication the greater the public interest in being properly informed and the le the statement related to commercial interest the more the statement would be protected by article of the convention in the present case there wa no doubt that there wa an ongoing public debate however the commercial interest of the applicant had very much been in the foreground of the communicated statement itself the applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal on point of law against that judgment which wa rejected by the supreme court on july the supreme court found that the applicant had not only called the f company a locust but had also reproached this company for negative conduct such a dominating doctor dismissing doctor who did not act in accordance with company wish and focusing on economic factor rather than the welfare of patient herrschaft über den ärztlichen berufstand kündigung nicht spurender ärzte orientierung an ökonomischen erwägungen und damit nicht am wohl der patienten therefore the expression used had turned into a statement of fact giving the reader the impression that the f company had already demonstrated unethical conduct which threatened the interest of doctor and patient in view of the specific circumstance of the case the prohibition ruled upon by the lower court wa justified even though the applicant had taken part in a debate of general public interest an untrue and damaging statement of fact wa not protected by freedom of expression furthermore the issuing of warning concerning the potential risk of the provision of medical service by company wa not a such prohibited by the decision of the austrian court the applicant had only been required to refrain from making untrue statement of fact in respect of their competitor the decision of the supreme court wa served on the applicant counsel on august ii relevant domestic lawa the chamber of medical doctor and the medical practitioner act according to article a of the federal constitution act bundesverfassungsgesetz

demand a retraction and publication of the retraction the lawi the government preliminary objectionsa the first applicant organisation victim status the government contested the first applicant organisation locus standi under article of the convention referring to the court caselaw they asserted that the first applicant organisation wa a governmental organisation under article a legally it wa a public body entrusted with fulfilling governmental duty those task were fulfilled by exercising typically governmental power such a the issuing of decree in proceeding relating to decision the first applicant organisation wa bound by the general administrative procedure act allgemeines verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz and the enforcement of it decision wa based on the federal law for the enforcement of administrative order verwaltungsvollstreckungsgesetz the decree issued by the first applicant organisation were supervised by the vienna regional government which had power to suspend them therefore the first applicant organisation wa not fully independent a required by the court caselaw moreover the relevant statement had been issued in the process of discharging the first applicant organisation legal public responsibility the first applicant organisation contested that assertion it wa true that legally it wa a public entity entrusted with the exercise of public function it wa therefore correct that it wa in general required to safeguard fundamental right but did not enjoy such right however aside from this legal aspect it also had a nongovernmental aspect which rendered it capable of being a party under article of the convention the court should therefore not examine the general ability of the organisation to use the power conferred on it by law but the act in question itself the issuing of the statement wa not an act of a governmental organisation but rather one of a privatelaw nature the court refers to it wellestablished case law to the effect that a legal entity claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the high contracting party of the right set forth in the convention or the protocol thereto may submit an application to the court provided that it is a nongovernmental organisation within the meaning of article of the convention the court reiterates that the idea behind this principle is to prevent a contracting party from acting a both an applicant and a respondent party before the court the term governmental organisation a opposed to nongovernmental organisation within the meaning of article includes legal entity which participate in the exercise of governmental power or run a public service under government control the term governmental organisation applies not only to the central organ of the state but also to decentralised authority that exercise public function regardless of their autonomy visàvis the central organ likewise it applies to regional and local authority including municipality in order to determine whether any given legal person fall within one of the two above category account must be taken of it legal status and where appropriate the right that status give it the nature of the activity it carry out the context in which it is carried out and the degree of it independence from the political authority see radio france and others v france dec no echr x and islamic republic of iran shipping line v turkey no echr v the court ha therefore considered a company to be a nongovernmental organisation where it wa governed essentially by company law did not enjoy any governmental or other power beyond those conferred by ordinary private law in the exercise of it activity and wa subject to the jurisdiction of the ordinary rather than the administrative court in the past the court ha also taken into account the fact that an applicant company carried out commercial activity and had neither a public service role nor a monopoly in a competitive sector see vỳchodoslovenská vodárenská spoločnosť a v slovakia dec no july state holding company luganksvugillya v ukraine dec no january and transpetrol a v slovakia dec no november with regard to austria the court ha stated that commune and the chamber of commerce had to be seen a governmental organisation within the meaning of article see respectively austrian commune and some of their councillor v austria no commission decision of may and wei v austria no commission decision of july however the austrian broadcasting corporation österreichischer rundfunk orf wa not seen a an governmental organisation within the meaning of article a it did not exercise governmental power and it independence and institutional autonomy had been preserved see österreichischer rundfunk v austria no december it is undisputed that the first applicant organisation exists by virtue of the legislature that thus provides it continued existence it legal status is therefore that of a publiclaw body and not an entity founded in accordance with private law the court observes further that the structure of the first applicant organisation is provided for by law and that membership is compulsory the relationship between the member and the governing body is defined by mean of public law issued by the governing body and is not subject to the jurisdiction of the civil court even the enforcement of payment of contribution arrears is a matter governed by the federal law for the enforcement of administrative order further the court observes that the mission of the first applicant organisation is prescribed by the medical practitioner act a well a regard the nature of it activity on one hand it is undisputed that the first applicant organisation may in certain matter act a a private entity and can be held liable before the ordinary court on the other hand there is agreement between the party that the first applicant organisation exercise governmental power and ha a public service role in organising and managing the education of doctor and their access to employed and selfemployed work in exercising all these function it is under the supervision of other state authority all the chamber organ can be dismissed from office by the regional government under the section b of the medical practitioner act moreover the activity of the first applicant organisation are financed by compulsory and enforceable contribution of all medical practitioner in austria see para the court is not persuaded by the first appplicant organisation argument that in publishing the impugned article he did not exercise of any governmental power within the meaning of article the impugned statement wa clearly made in exercising the chamber public function accordingly the court concludes that the first applicant organisation is not a person nongovernmental organisation or group of individual within the meaning of article of the convention in accordance with article it follows that the application is incompatible ratione persona with the provision of the convention the court must therefore reject the application of the first applicant organisation a inadmissible b the second applicant victim status the government further argued that the second applicant had acted a the president of the first applicant organisation and therefore a the head of a governmental organisation he had used the first applicant organisation website to publish his statement and had done this to fulfil his duty towards doctor his act should be regarded a governed by public law and his application should therefore be declared inadmissible ratione persona the second applicant contested that argument and emphasised that the national court had found that he had not acted within the sphere of the duty conferred by public law otherwise the court could not have prohibited him from repeating the statement in question the court reiterates that the term victim used in article of the convention denotes the person directly affected by the act or omission which is in issue see centro europa srl and di stefano v italy gc no echr in the present case the court prohibited the second applicant a natural person from repeating the statement that the f company wa ruthless towards third party in particular medical professional and from referring to the f company a a locust locust company or locust fund it wa undisputed in the course of the domestic proceeding that the second applicant hereby acted a a representative of the first applicant however by addressing the court order explicitly also to the second applicant a a natural person it affected the second applicant individually therefore the court considers that the second applicant ha standing to introduce the present application the government objection is thus dismissed moreover the second applicant complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article of the convention the court further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it is therefore declared admissible ii alleged violation of article of the convention the second applicant complained of an infringement of his right to freedom of expression a a result of the measure imposed on him by domestic court he relied on article of the convention which read everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government accepted that there had been interference by public authority with the exercise of the applicant right to freedom of expression they contended however that that interference satisfied the requirement of the second paragraph of article an interference contravenes article of the convention unless it is prescribed by law pursues one or more of the legitimate aim referred to in paragraph of article and in addition to being proportionate is necessary in a democratic society for achieving such aim a the party submission the second applicant accepted that the interference served a legitimate aim namely the protection of the reputation or right of others within the meaning of article of the convention however in his view the imposed prohibition had not been lawful a section of the unfair competition act wa not clear and a prohibition based on that law wa therefore not foreseeable accordingly the interference wa not prescribed by law a regard the necessity of the interference the second applicant emphasised that he had contributed to a debate of public interest and that in respect of public shareholder company the limit of acceptable criticism were wider he acknowledged that the term locust had a negative meaning associated with privateequity fund however there had been a substantive factual basis for his allegation a the shareholder of the f company were also company limited by share and a privateequity fund wa managing the holding of one of the shareholder of the f company by calling the f company a locust company he had not intended to act competitively instead his intention had been to voice a pointed criticism of a process he considered unlawful the statement had aimed to point out the ongoing shift from the predominance of independent medical practitioner to a medical service determined by capital and the consequent risk involved for doctor and their work moreover the prohibition imposed by the domestic court would prevent him from fulfilling his duty a president of the vienna chamber of medical doctor therefore the interference wa also not proportionate the government submitted that the interference wa prescribed by law a it had it basis in section and of the unfair competition act those provision were formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct a required by the court caselaw in the field of competition law in particular an absolutely precise formulation could not be expected a business market and way of communicating would always be subject to change in addition the interference had pursued a legitimate aim in relation to the necessity of the interference the government submitted that the interference wa based on ground which were sufficient and relevant in term of the aim pursued and wa proportionate to those aim they accepted that the second applicant had taken part in a debate on a matter of public interest namely public health care in austria the domestic court had issued decision which in the past the court had accepted a being within the wide margin of appreciation in purely commercial matter the austrian court had followed this caselaw and had considered the second applicant statement to be a statement of fact on that basis they had conducted a careful and detailed examination of the case and the party argument the second applicant had failed to prove the existence of these fact the fact that the f company wa a company limited by share wa no proof that it would be ruthless towards it employee or act like a locust even if the statement had to be treated a a value judgment the second applicant had failed to show a sufficient factual basis to support his assertion the second applicant had acted for competitive purpose a he had stated himself at the firstinstance hearing moreover the court had not prohibited the second applicant from warning against the alleged threat company limited by share would pose to the system of medical care in instance where such warning had a sufficient factual basis the government further pointed out that the court had not imposed a penalty but rather an obligation not to repeat the statement that the f company acted ruthlessly or wa a locust therefore the interference with the second applicant right wa of minor effect it would not prevent him from participating in the ongoing debate about the impact of company on medical service b the court assessment prescribed by lawand legitimate aim the court reiterates that in the past it ha held that section of the unfair competition act which prohibits unfair commercial practice or any other unfair action which might affect the competitive capability of a business in a significant way for competitive purpose wa sufficiently precise for the purpose of article of the convention and accordingly that an interference based on that provision wa prescribed by law within the meaning of article see krone verlag gmb h co kg v austria no no echr xii section of the unfair competition act defines conduct in more detail than section and in substance prohibits allegation being made or fact being disseminated about a competitor business for competitive purpose unless such fact are demonstrably true the court see that provision a sufficiently precise for the purpose of article of the convention also the national court order to cease and desist are the legal consequence clearly outlined in section of that act therefore the court considers that the interference wa prescribed by law namely by section and of the unfair competition act moreover there is agreement between the party that the interference served a legitimate aim namely the protection of the reputation or right of others within the meaning of article of the convention the court share this view necessary in a democratic society the court note that in the present case the second applicant made a public statement which affected the reputation of the f company the right to protection of reputation is a right which is protected by article of the convention in order for article to come into play however an attack on a person reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness see delfi a v estonia gc no echr the court ha reiterated many time that in case which require the right to respect for private life to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression the outcome of the application should not in theory vary according to whether it ha been lodged with the court under article of the convention by the person who wa the subject of the statement or under article by the person who made the statement indeed a a matter of principle these right deserve equal respect see von hannover v germany no gc no and echr the court reiterates that under it caselaw contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity of an interference but this margin is subject to european supervision a regard both the relevant rule and the decision applying them see markt intern verlag gmb h and klaus beermann v germany november series a no the court ha identified a number of criterion in the context of balancing the competing right the relevant criterion thus defined are contribution to a debate of public interest the degree of notoriety of the person affected the subject of the news report the prior conduct of the person concerned the content form and consequence of the publication and where appropriate the circumstance in which the photograph were taken where it examines an application lodged under article the court will also examine the way in which the information wa obtained and it veracity and the gravity of the penalty imposed on the person who made the statement see mutatis mutandis couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no november the court ha also found that large public company inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their act and that the limit of acceptable criticism are wider in respect of such company however in addition to the public interest in open debate about business practice there is a competing interest in protecting the commercial success and viability of company not just for the benefit of shareholder and employee but also for the wider economic good therefore the state enjoys a margin of appreciation a to the mean it provides under domestic law by which a company can challenge the truth and limit the damage of allegation which risk harming it reputation see steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii furthermore the court emphasis that a wider margin of appreciation entrusted to the state is essential in the complex and fluctuating area of unfair competition see krone verlag gmb h co kg no cited above and jacubowski v germany june series a no a however it is necessary to reduce the extent of the margin of appreciation when what is at stake is not an individual purely commercial statement but his participation in a debate of general interest for example a debate about public health see hertel v switzerland august report vi the court note that in order to ass the justification of a statement which is in issue a distinction must be made between statement of fact and value judgment while the existence of fact can be demonstrated the truth of value judgment is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article however even where a statement amount to a value judgment there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it the classification of a statement a one of fact or a a value judgment is a matter which in the first place fall within the margin of appreciation of the national authority in particular the court see lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc no and echr iv however the court can change this classification under it supervisory role see kharlamov v russia no october pinto pinheiro marque v portugal no january turning to the circumstance of the present case the court note that the domestic court took the statement of january into consideration in it entirety and found that the statement wa made in the clearly economic context of competing medical practice and capital company providing the same service they acknowledged that where a competitor even for economic purpose took part in a debate of public interest freedom of expression had to hold more weight with regard to the balancing exercise however the term locust wa almost exclusively loaded with negative meaning which led to an unethical general vilification of a competitor the word used gave the reader the impression that the f company had already demonstrated unethical conduct which harmed the interest of doctor and patient therefore the domestic court judged the relevant statement to be one of fact the statement wa also likely to damage the f company commercial interest and had not been proved to be true the court considers that there is no need to further clarify whether the present statement wa one of fact or a value judgment since a sufficient factual basis for it wa needed in any case for a company which offer medical service the accusation that it acted a a locust which a can be seen from the context of the applicant letter also implied that the f company or similar company placed economic interest above those of it patient wa a particularly serious one which affected it reputation thus even if the applicant had intended to make that statement in the context of a wider debate on an issue of public concern he had to have a solid factual basis on which to base that allegation in the domestic proceeding the austrian court after carefully examining the argument put forward by the applicant concluded that there wa no such factual basis and the applicant ha likewise not provided any persuasive argument substantiating his allegation neither the fact that the share in the f company are owned by other company limited by share and that one of those shareholder is managed by a privateequity fund nor the fact that financial resource for expansion are raised by debenture provides a factual basis for the unethical conduct typically associated with locust corporation in addition the fact that doctor are employee within the f company doe not provide a factual basis for the second applicant allegation the general remark by the second applicant concerning the future impact of the growing popularity of company providing medical service are not related to any action on the part of the f company therefore they can not provide a factual basis for his allegation against that company accordingly the court arrives at the conclusion that the prohibition imposed on the second applicant wa based on relevant and sufficient ground a regard the measure imposed on the second applicant the court note that according to it caselaw the nature and severity of the interference imposed are factor to be taken into account when assessing it proportionality see mutatis mutandis lindon otchakovsky laurens and july cited above and europapress holding doo v croatia no october the vienna commercial court did not impose a penalty but prohibited the second applicant from calling the f company ruthless by the term locust the second applicant wa also ordered to publish the operative part of the vienna commercial court judgment on the first applicant organisation website and in it print newsletter even if the second applicant now risk the imposition of fine for noncompliance with the injunction the nature and severity of the court action wa moderate the second applicant also failed to give reason a to why the court action would prevent him from fulfilling his duty in conclusion the court find that the interference with the exercise of the second applicant right to freedom of expression wa necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention in order to protect the reputation and right of the f company there ha therefore been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the application of the first applicant organisation inadmissible and the remainder of the application admissible hold that there ha been no violation of

41,background to the case the applicant wa born in and life in weinheim he is a campaigner against abortion and operates an antiabortion website in december there wa an ongoing public debate on development in human embryonic stemcell research a part of the debate the catholic bishop f voiced criticism of human embryonic stemcell research and a group of scientist at the university of bonn responded to that criticism on december bishop f issued a press release repudiating allegation that his earlier comment had implied a degree of similarity between the scientist carrying out embryonic stemcell research and the nazi who had performed experiment on human he emphasised that he had had absolutely no intention of casting such defamatory aspersion upon the scientist but reasserted his belief that there wa an urgent need for such vitally important ethical issue to be debated critically he claimed that he had never wished to imply that there had been any link between stemcell research and the ideological and historical context of the crime committed by the dehumanising nazi system which should not be relativised through comparison on december the applicant issued a press release for his initiative never again nie wieder e v with the title dog which have been hit bark stemcell research in germany getroffene hunde bellen stammzellenforschung in deutschland the press release wa published on the internet and handed out a leaflet it read the initiative never again nie wieder e v and the austrian christian social working group christlich soziale arbeitsgemeinschaft österreichs wish to make known their opposition to the press release issued by the university of bonn on december which bear the signature of eighteen wellknown professor and in which the professor express their outrage at the comment made by bishop f name abbreviated by the court comparing modernday stemcell research to the experiment on human being carried out by the nazi the professor appear to have forgotten that these experiment were performed in nazi time by willing doctor and scientist these doctor and scientist who were clearly in bondage to the rogue state and subservient to it also carried out their research solely for the good of the people the research performed during the nazi regime took place at a later stage of human life the presentday research take place at an earlier stage of human life do the professor want to determine human right to life on the basis of how useful they are the principle of human dignity doe not apply only after a particular phase of growth ha been completed and people should not be allowed to experiment at will during this phase the professor can spin it any way they want aggravated murder mord will always be aggravated murder regardless of the stage of life at which the human being is destroyed the fact that others were responsible for performing these contract killing doe not provide moral justification for working with this human material the comment made by bishop f name abbreviated by the court which were presumably addressed directly to prof dr b name abbreviated by the court were absolutely accurate prof dr b us embryo people for research purpose at the university of bonn that were murdered in israel and then sold to germany for significant sum of money during nazi time german scientist performed research experiment on jew and then murdered them nowadays the unborn child of people who follow the religion of moses the jew are murdered and sold to the christian country of germany for research purpose all with the blessing of both israel and germany the comparison drawn by bishop f wa entirely justified the crime against democracy being committed in the here and now must be denounced in the strongest possible term and brought to people attention the time ha finally arrived to overcome the spirit of auschwitz b criminal proceeding on november the weinheim district court convicted the applicant of insult and sentenced him to a penalty of thirty daily fine of euro eur each in it judgment the court acknowledged the applicant right to freedom of expression and to impart to others his belief that the fusion of an egg and a sperm represented the beginning of human life and that research using imported stem cell from terminated embryo involved the destruction of human life it also emphasised that the applicant had the fundamental liberty to exercise his freedom of expression by imparting his opinion strikingly and pointedly including in the form of abusive criticism addressed at wellknown researcher referred to by name however the court found that when viewed in it entirety the press release had exceeded the permissible bound of abusive criticism the court based this decision on the fact that the implication that the scientist had been guilty not just of committing murder but of doing so for deeply despicable motif had been a central theme running through the press release and had escalated in the phrase the time ha finally arrived to overcome the spirit of auschwitz it concluded that the applicant had intended to imply that the scientist carrying out stemcell research had been prompted by the same criminal sadistic and dehumanising motif a those responsible for performing unimaginably cruel mass experiment on human such a mengele in auschwitz given prof dr b position a a doctor and scientist this implication had been severely insulting on march the mannheim regional court rejected the applicant appeal similarly to the district court the regional court acknowledged the applicant right to freedom of expression and that his press release had contributed to a debate of great public interest it further held that the majority of the statement in the press release had been value judgment and that therefore the press release had to be classified a a value judgment and not a a statement of fact nonetheless the court stated that freedom of expression wa not granted unconditionally and could be subject to restriction with a view to protecting inter alia the right to personal honour when examining contribution to a debate of public interest however there had to be a presumption in favour of freedom of speech the regional court further found that the criterion for abusive criticism had not been met criticism which wa excessive or even aggressive in nature wa not necessarily abusive the relevant criterion wa whether the main purpose of the criticism had been to defame an individual rather than to debate the relevant issue the court concluded that this wa not applicable in the case at hand since the applicant past behaviour and the content of the press release showed that the focus had been on the issue rather than the individual doctor against whom allegation had been made the court therefore found that the right to freedom of expression had to be balanced with the legally protected personality right of prof dr b and emphasised that freedom of expression granted equal protection to all statement of opinion regardless of whether they were useful useless correct incorrect emotional rational or even polemical or insulting the regional court took into account that the press release had represented the applicant contribution to the formation of public opinion but believed that referring to prof dr b by name had been equivalent to linking his professional conduct to the atrocity committed by the nazi it concluded that this had represented a serious infringement of his personality right which had also been unnecessary since the applicant could have contributed to the debate without referring to the professor by name on february the court of appeal rejected an appeal on point of law by the applicant a unfounded and on july the federal constitutional court refused to admit a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant without providing reason bv r ii relevant domestic law the relevant provision of the german basic law grundgesetz read in so far a relevant a follows article every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinion in speech writing and picture and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible source these right shall find their limit in the provision of general law in provision for the protection of young person and in the right to personal honour the relevant provision of the german criminal code strafgesetzbuch read a follows article insult insult shall be punished with imprisonment for not more than one year or a fine and if the insult is committed by mean of violence with imprisonment for not more than two year or a fine the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that his criminal conviction for insult had violated his right to freedom of expression a provided in article of the convention which read in so far a relevant a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or right of others the government contested that argument a admissibility the court note that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission the applicant argued that his press release had contributed to a debate of great public importance and had not aimed at personally attacking prof dr b even though the domestic court had accepted that the applicant had focussed on the issue and had clarified that he had not used abusive criticism they nonetheless had by misinterpreting the actual statement construed an insult in respect of prof dr b which had exceeded the actual content of his press release the applicant further submitted that the court had insufficiently taken into account that prof dr b had been part of the public debate and had acted a an unofficial spokesperson of the scientist conducting stemcell research in germany consequently sharper criticism and mentioning him by name had been justified the government accepted that the criminal conviction had interfered with the applicant freedom of expression however they submitted that this interference had had a legal basis in article of the criminal code which had served to protect prof dr b personality right and reputation and had been necessary in a democratic society the domestic court had after analysing the text of the press release reasonably interpreted the statement a an implication that the stemcell research carried out by prof dr b had been equivalent to the human experiment performed by scientist during nazi time after weighing up the interest of the applicant against the right of prof dr b the court had ultimately found that priority should be given to protecting the personality right of prof dr b in the undertaken balancing exercise the court had taken into account that the applicant press release had been protected by the right to freedom of expression that he had had a right to express insulting criticism and that he had been contributing to a public debate however they had also considered the historical and social context of the comparison the severity of the violation of prof dr b personality right and the fact that the applicant could have made an equally important or noteworthy contribution to the debate without referring to the professor in question by name the government argued that the court had therefore taken adequate account of the applicant right and that the decision had not fallen outside the margin of appreciation a granted by the court to domestic authority the thirdpartys submission the thirdparty intervener amcb submitted that the convention granted particular protection to statement that contributed to a public debate moreover since ngo had a similar function to the press in a democratic society a public watchdog their statement required even further increased protection under article of the convention this held true also for unofficial association which expressed unpopular or minority opinion article also protected idea that offend shock or disturb and it wa the right of the person who expressed her or his opinion to choose the most efficient way to do so amcb therefore argued that comparison with the holocaust could be considered legitimate expression of opinion even when taking the historical and social context into account the court assessment at the outset the court considers and this is not in dispute between the party that the criminal conviction interfered with the applicant right to freedom of expression that it wa prescribed by law namely article of the criminal code and that it pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or right of others it therefore remains to be determined whether the interference were necessary in a democratic society the fundamental principle concerning the question of whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the court caselaw and have recently been summarised a follows see delfi a v estonia gc no june with further referencesi freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society a set forth in article this freedom is subject to exception which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article iii the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact the court further reiterates that the right to protection of reputation is protected by article of the convention a part of the right to respect for private life see chauvy and others v france no echr vi pfeifer v austria no november and polanco torres and movilla polanco v spain no september in order for article to come into play however an attack on a person reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be made in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see a v norway no april axel springer ag v germany gc no february and delfi a cited above when examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interest of the protection of the reputation or right of others the court may be required to ascertain whether the domestic authority have struck a fair balance when protecting two value guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain case namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see hachette filipacchi associés v france no june mgn limited v the united kingdom no january axel springer ag cited above and delfi a cited above in case that require the right to respect for private life to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression the court considers that the outcome of the application should not in theory vary according to whether it ha been lodged with the court under article of the convention or under article indeed a a matter of principle these right deserve equal respect see von hannover v germany no gc no and echr the court ha already found that regardless of the forcefulness of political struggle it is legitimate to try to ensure a minimum degree of moderation and propriety and that a clear distinction must be made between criticism and insult if the sole intent of a particular form of expression is to insult a person an appropriate sanction would not in principle constitute a violation of article of the convention see genner v austria no january the court ha further differentiated between statement of fact and value judgment the classification of a statement a fact or a a valuejudgment is a matter which first and foremost fall within the margin of appreciation of the national authority in particular the domestic court see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no while the existence of fact can be demonstrated the truth of value judgment is not susceptible of proof however even where a statement amount to a value judgment there must be a sufficient factual basis to support it failing which it will be excessive see jerusalem v austria no echr ii in addition when the court examined case concerning value judgment which the domestic court had found to be of a defamatory character it assessed whether the language used had been of an excessive or dispassionate nature and whether an intention of defaming or stigmatising the opponent had been disclosed see genner cited above turning to the circumstance of the present case the court note that the mannheim regional court classified the press release in it entirety a a value judgment and will therefore proceed on the assumption that the statement are to be considered value judgment the court observes that the domestic court understood the text of the press release a implying that the conduct of the scientist carrying out stemcell research and in particular of prof b wa seen a equivalent to the atrocity committed by the nazi the applicant challenged this understanding of his press release the court note however that the applicant press release contained a series of comparison between modernday stemcell research and experiment carried out on human during the nazi regime which culminated in the sentence the time ha finally arrived to overcome the spirit of auschwitz given these statement the court see no reason to call into question the domestic court conclusion that the applicant did indeed directly link the work of the scientist and in particular of prof dr b to the atrocity during nazi time the court further note that the allegation made by the applicant were particularly serious even if a in the instant case regarded a value judgment such serious and particularly offensive comparison demand a particularly solid factual basis compare genner cited above while the court accepts that the moral responsibility of scientist wa the issue discussed this alone doe not provide a solid factual basis for targeting personally prof b scientific work this all the more so a the comparison used wa not only shocking and disturbing but went beyond the limit of any acceptable criticism the court also note that the domestic court concluded that the focus of the press release had been on the issue and had sought to contribute to a public debate rather than defaming the individual doctor it accepts this finding but would add that the applicant nonetheless made allegation against the scientist and doctor conducting stemcell research and in particular against prof dr b the court therefore find that even though the intention behind the applicant press release wa not mainly to defame the scientist by naming prof dr b it still had a stigmatising and defaming effect in regard to the seriousness of the personal attack on the scientist and prof dr b the court reiterates that the impact an expression of opinion ha on another person personality right can not be detached from the historical and social context in which the statement wa made see annen v germany no november and hoffer and annen v germany no and january the comparison of modernday stemcell research to experiment carried out on human in concentration camp must therefore be seen in the specific context of german history the court ha previously accepted that in the light of their historical role and experience state which have experienced the nazi horror may be regarded a having a special moral responsibility to distance themselves from the mass atrocity perpetrated by the nazi see perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extract and nix v germany dec no march the court therefore concludes that the attack on prof dr b reputation wa serious and that the historical context is a weighty factor to be taken into account when assessing whether there existed a pressing social need for interfering with the applicant right to freedom of expression compare nix cited above the court also observes that prof dr b and the other scientist had by responding to the criticism voiced by bishop f entered the public debate concerning stemcell research before the publication of the applicant press release and therefore find that they could not claim the same particular protection a individual completely unknown to the public notwithstanding the fact that the applicant statement sought to contribute to a public debate and that prof dr b had entered the public stage to a certain degree the court concludes that the domestic court provided relevant and sufficient reason for the criminal conviction of the applicant the court recall that where the balancing exercise ha been undertaken by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the court would require strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see delfi a cited above with further reference it find that the decision by the domestic court were based on a reasonable assessment of the statement in question the right of prof dr b and of the circumstance of the present case lastly the court observes that the sanction wa criminal in nature which is in view of the existence of other mean of intervention and rebuttal particularly through civil remedy one of the most serious form of interference with the right to freedom of expression see perinçek cited above and frisk and jensen v denmark no december while the use of criminallaw sanction in defamation case is not in itself disproportionate the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are factor to be taken into account because they must not be such a to dissuade the press or others who engage in public debate from taking part in the discussion of matter of legitimate public concern ziembiński v poland no no july with further reference in that regard it note that the applicant wa sentenced to a penalty of daily fine of eur each and thereby to a sentence at the lower end of the possible criminal sanction for insult having regard to the seriousness of the violation of prof dr b personality right and the nature of the personalized attack when seen in the historical context see paragraph above the court find that the penalty appears moderate and did not fall outside of the domestic court margin of appreciation there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the complaint concerning article of the convention admissible

photocopy and photograph the criminal case material stored in the archive of the court registry by a decision of august the court registry stated that the second applicant request could not be granted in it current form more specifically it invited her to specify exactly which information andor document she wished to consult and for what purpose stating that it would review it decision upon receipt of the requested information the registry advised the second applicant that the criminal case file in question contained certain classified investigative information public disclosure of which wa strictly prohibited section and of the special investigative activity act of april it further advised her that the criminal case file contained personal data about te a well a other party to the criminal proceeding in question and that public disclosure of that information wa only possible with their explicit consent article of the general administrative code the second applicant never provided the further clarification sought by the court registry instead on september she lodged a court action concerning the registry decision of august requesting it annulment a confirmed by a statement of claim dated september filed with the borjomi district court the second applicant acting on behalf of the first applicant did not explain the purpose of her request to access the criminal case file in question she merely claimed that the registry decision of august had restricted her right of access to information of public interest which wa enshrined in article of the general administrative code according to the transcript of a hearing before the borjomi district court on december attended by both party the second applicant briefly mentioned that she needed to obtain access to the criminal case file for the purpose of a journalistic investigation project however she did not give any detail about the project in question and relied exclusively on the general argument that her right of access to public information should not be limited she further provided extensive legal argument a to why the respondent interpretation of the relevant provision of the special investigative activity act and the general administrative code had been erroneous by a judgment of december the borjomi district court dismissed the second applicant action a illfounded it confirmed that the respondent decision to withhold the criminal case material from the second applicant had been legitimate and based on a correct interpretation of section and of the special investigative activity act and article of the general administrative code on january the second applicant appealed against the judgment of december complaining that the firstinstance court had incorrectly interpreted the relevant provision of domestic law in her statement of appeal she focused exclusively on her right to have unfettered access to public information without giving any detail a to why she had sought access to the criminal case material according to the transcript of a hearing before the tbilisi court of appeal on june attended by both party the second applicant stated i a a journalist no longer need access to the criminal case material because the journalistic investigation ha already been terminated and it result have already been published however she emphasised that what wa important for her wa the creation a legal precedent that would acknowledge the significance of the right to have unfettered access to information of public interest she considered that a criminal case file wa public information within the meaning of article of the general administrative code and that anyone wa entitled to have access to it by a judgment of june the tbilisi court of appeal dismissed the second applicant appeal a illfounded and upheld the judgment of the lower court on february the supreme court rejected an appeal on point of law lodged by the second applicant a inadmissible terminating the proceeding b application no the third applicant wa a practising lawyer in georgia on march he wa convicted of fraud for stealing money entrusted to him by a client for the purpose of securing bail in criminal proceeding he wa sentenced to three year and six month in prison for further detail see nozadze v georgia dec committee no may on october the third applicant while still in prison asked the registry of tbilisi city court to send him a copy of all the court order concerning the imposition of pretrial preventive measure in six distinct and unrelated criminal case he did not specify why he wa interested in that particular information on october the registry of tbilisi city court sent the third applicant a copy of the operative part of the relevant court order stating that in accordance with article of the code of criminal procedure a in force at the material time only the operative part of detention order could be disclosed on november the third applicant brought a court action against the registry of the tbilisi city court complaining that it refusal to provide him with a full copy of the relevant court order had infringed his right under article of the general administrative code to have unfettered access to public information by a judgment of december the tbilisi court of appeal dismissed the applicant action a illfounded the court stated that the relevant chapter of the general administrative code and more specifically article thereof which provided for the right to receive public information from the state and regulated the procedure for the exercise of that right did not apply pursuant to article and of the same code to the judiciary within the framework of the administration of justice in that connection the court attached significance to the fact that all six of the criminal case about which the third applicant had tried to obtain information were still ongoing at that time on july the supreme court of georgia sitting in camera rejected an appeal on point of law lodged by the third applicant terminating the proceeding a copy of the final decision wa served on the third applicant on october ii relevant domestic law

the court find it appropriate to examine them jointly in a single judgment in accordance with rule of the rule of court ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the domestic judicial authority had denied them access to information of general public interest they relied on article of the convention the relevant part of which read a follows everyone ha the

others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the government objected that application no should be rejected a inadmissible under article b of the convention a the first and second applicant had not suffered a significant disadvantage in connection with their complaint under article of the convention thus even in the absence of access to the relevant court decision the two applicant had been able to conduct their journalistic investigation and publish it result see paragraph above the government did not make any objection to the admissibility of application no the first and second applicant disagreed with the government objection relating to the admissibility of their complaint under article of the convention reiterating that the subject matter of the application wa not whether or not they had been able to conduct their journalistic investigation but rather the matter of principle that they had been unlawfully denied access to information of public interest while the government have not raised an objection a regard the applicability of article of the convention the court considers that it ha to address this issue of it own motion it recall in this connection that question relating to the applicability of article and the existence of interference the latter forming part of the merit of the relevant complaint are often inextricably linked see magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no and november and also a regard the applicability of article of the convention see denisov v ukraine gc no september a it ha previously explained in the latter case concerning article since the question of applicability is an issue of the court jurisdiction ratione materiae a a general rule the relevant analysis should be carried out at the admissibility stage unless there is a particular reason to join this question to the merit ibid in the present case the court considers that the significance of the fact that the first and second applicant were able to finalise their journalistic investigation for the purpose of which they had requested access to certain court decision is closely linked with the question of whether there ha been an interference with their right under article of the convention more importantly the present case raise a novel issue at domestic level and is one of the first case following the judgment of the grand chamber in magyar helsinki bizottság to test the limit to the right of access to information recognized in that judgment in certain circumstance and the applicability of article of the convention in that regard accordingly the court decides to join the government objection to the merit of application no furthermore it decides to examine the question of applicability of article of the convention together with that pertaining to the existence of interference under this provision on the merit of the present case that decision however doe not detract from the general rule referenced above according to which issue relating to the applicability of article will normally fall to be examined in most case at the admissibility stage the court further observes that all three applicant complaint under article of the convention are neither manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention nor inadmissible on any other ground these complaint must therefore be declared admissible b merit the applicant submission the first and second applicant application no relying on the relevant criterion developed by the court in it judgment of magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no november first argued that their inability to have access to the relevant court decision had constituted an interference with the exercise of their right to freedom of expression they explained that they had sought access to the criminal case material because they believed that the person who had come forward a the victim in those criminal proceeding had in actual fact been an agent provocateur and they had at the material time been working on a documentary exposing police misconduct acknowledging the fact that they had been able to finalise their journalistic investigation even in the absence of the solicited information see paragraph above and paragraph below the two applicant argued that the disclosure of that information would have allowed them to deliver an even better journalistic product the first and second applicant argued that the relevant judicial authority refusal to grant them access to information of interest to them had been unlawful because the criminal case material had related not to an ongoing criminal case but one which had already been terminated they claimed that since the special investigative activity act did not apply to closed criminal case section should not have been relied on a the legal basis for withholding public information from them the two applicant further argued that the interference with their right to receive information had not pursued any legitimate aim and had been disproportionate thus with respect to those element the applicant argued among other thing that since the criminal case material had already been examined openly and publicly in court it nondisclosure could not possibly serve the interest of protecting either a state secret or personal data about the party to the proceeding the third applicant no although not referring directly to the principle laid down in the case of magyar helsinki bizottság cited above in substance provided argument in line with the first two applicant submission he stated that he had not deemed it necessary to indicate to the domestic judicial authority the purpose of his request for access to the relevant court decision because it wa his understanding that the right enshrined in article of the general administrative code meant that public authority were under an absolute obligation to divulge information held in their possession he further stated that since all six of the criminal case about which he had requested information had been directed against former highranking state official who had all been wellknown public figure prosecuted for various corruption offence the public had had the right to know all the detail about those highprofile criminal proceeding the third applicant further claimed that generally speaking full access to decision issued by domestic court promoted the general principle of transparency and accountability lastly he claimed in line with the first and second applicant submission that the interference with his right to receive information under article of the convection had been unlawful and disproportionate the government argument a regard application no the government submitted that there had not been an interference with the first and second applicant right to receive information a even in the absence of access to the court decision of interest to them they had been able to finalise their journalistic investigation and had published it result in the form of a video uploaded onto the first applicant official you tube channel referring the court to the web address of the video in question the government noted that it had already had more than thirtyseven thousand view which could be taken a proof that the applicant had been successful in their investigation and that consequently there could be no room for suspecting that the state had interfered with their freedom of expression furthermore the government emphasised that the reply of the khashuri district court registry had not been absolute but conditional the judicial authority had simply asked the applicant to provide further clarification upon receipt of which it would review it position concerning the public disclosure of the relevant document alternatively assuming that there had been an interference with the first and second applicant right under article of the convention the government submitted extensive argument to show by reference to various example of relevant domestic legal practice that the interference had been lawful and had pursued in a proportionate manner the legitimate aim of protecting from public disclosure information classified a state secret and personal data with respect to application no the government submitted that the third applicant had requested access to the court decision in his capacity a an ordinary citizen he wa neither a journalist nor associated with any other social watchdog and hence his freedomofexpression right had been more prone to restriction the third applicant could not be said to have requested access to the relevant information in order to contribute to an informed public debate assuming that there had been an interference with the third applicant right to freedom of expression the government submitted extensive argument to show that it had been lawful and proportionate the court assessmenta general principle regarding the applicability of article and the existence of interference the court reiterates that article of the convention doe not confer on the individual a right of access to information held by a public authority nor oblige the government to impart such information to the individual however such a right or obligation may arise firstly where disclosure of the information ha been imposed by a judicial order which ha gained legal force and secondly in circumstance where access to the information is instrumental for the individual exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression whether and to what extent the denial of access to information constitutes an interference with an applicant freedomofexpression right must be assessed in each individual case and in the light of it particular circumstance see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above in order to determine whether article can be said to apply to a public authority refusal to disclose information the situation must be assessed in the light of the following criterion a the purpose of the information request b the nature of the information sought c the particular role of the seeker of the information in receiving and imparting it to the public and d whether the information wa ready and available ibid b application of these principle to the circumstance of the present case turning to the circumstance of application no the court note that whilst the journalistic role of the first and second applicant wa undeniably compatible with the scope of the right to solicit access to stateheld information compare for instance roşiianu v romania no june the purpose of their information request can not be said to have satisfied the relevant criterion under article of the convention see the preceding paragraph in fine this is because they failed to specify in the relevant domestic proceeding the purpose of their request for permission to consult the criminal case file they never explained to the relevant court registry why the document were necessary for the exercise of their freedom to receive and impart information to others see paragraph above and contrast cangı v turkey no january noting that omission the domestic authority explicitly invited the applicant to address that gap by clarifying the purpose of their request what is more the authority expressed it readiness to reconsider it initial refusal upon receipt of the requisite information from the applicant the latter however ignored that opportunity and instead decided to sue the authority for breaching their alleged right to have unrestricted access to stateheld information of public interest see paragraph and above and compare sioutis v greece dec no august and also mutatis mutandis bubon v russia no february however it should be restated in this connection that article of the convention doe not confer on individual an absolute right to access stateheld information see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above the court further observes that even in the absence of the information sought the first and second applicant were able to proceed with their journalistic investigation thus even without waiting for the outcome of the relevant proceeding which they themselves had initiated against the domestic judicial authority they finalised the investigation and made it result accessible to the public see paragraph and above in other word it can be inferred from the particular circumstance of the case at hand that the access sought by the first and second applicant to the relevant criminal case material wa not instrumental for the effective exercise of their freedomofexpression right see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above and contrast cangı cited above indeed the second applicant acknowledged herself before the domestic court that she a a journalist had not needed the information for the purpose of her journalistic activity and that it had been merely a matter of principle for her to obtain judicial acknowledgement of what she considered to be her unfettered right to have access to stateheld public information see again paragraph above a regard the first and second applicant argument regarding the correlation between the disclosure of the information of interest to them and the quality of their ultimate journalistic product see paragraph above the court observes that they have never voiced any similar argument before the domestic court a regard application no it should be noted that the third applicant like the first and second applicant did not take the trouble to explain to the relevant court registry the purpose of his request to obtain a full copy of the relevant court decision see paragraph above which make it impossible for the court to accept that the information sought wa instrumental for the exercise of his freedomofexpression right contrast cangı cited above and most importantly it is unclear how the third applicant role in society wa supposed to satisfy the relevant criterion under article of the convention thus the court observes that the third applicant wa neither a journalist nor a representative of a public watchdog ibid he did not clarify in the proceeding before the court how he could enhance by receiving a copy of detention order in six criminal case totally unrelated to him the public access to news or facilitate the dissemination of information in the interest of public governance compare magyar helsinki bizottság cited above and sioutis cited above nor is the court persuaded that the information solicited from the domestic judicial authority by the third applicant met the relevant publicinterest test under article of the convention see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above while acknowledging the significance of the principle that court decision are to be pronounced publicly and should be in some form made accessible to the public in the interest of the good administration of justice and transparency see for instance fazliyski v bulgaria no april the court restates that the requirement that the information sought meet a publicinterest test in order to prompt a need for disclosure under article of the convention is different a it refers to the specific subjectmatter of the document in this case of the judicial order compare sioutis the decision cited above and österreichische vereinigung zur erhaltung stärkung und schaffung v austria no and november in that connection that is a regard the question of whether or not the specific subjectmatter of the solicited document involved publicinterest consideration the applicant limited his argument to mentioning that the solicited judicial decision concerned highprofile criminal case instituted against former highranking state official for corruption offence see paragraph above however the court considers that the fact that the accused in those case were wellknown public figure wa not in itself sufficient to justify under article disclosure of a full copy of the relevant judicial order concerning the ongoing criminal proceeding including the part which did not constitute public information according to the domestic law applicable at the material time see paragraph and above to a third party acting in a purely private capacity compare mutatis mutandis with sioutis the decision cited above and indeed the public interest is hardly the same a an audience curiosity compare mutatis mutandis magyar helsinki bizottság cited above the foregoing consideration concerning the question of applicability of article of the convention and the existence of interference under this provision are sufficient to enable the court to conclude that there ha been no violation of the said article with respect to either of the two application at hand accordingly there is no need to rule on the government objection regarding the lack of significant disadvantage in relation to application no iii other alleged violation of the convention lastly a regard application no the third applicant complained under article of the convention about the length of the relevant domestic proceeding the court having regard to the fact that the domestic proceeding lasted approximately two year and three month overall at three level of jurisdiction find that the complaint is manifestly illfounded and must be rejected in accordance with article a and of the convention for these reason the court unanimously decides to join the application join to the merit the government objection regarding the lack of significant disadvantage a regard application no decides to examine on the merit the question of applicability of article of the convention and the existence of interference with the applicant right under this provision declares the applicant complaint under article of the convention admissible and the remainder of application no inadmissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention decides that there is no need to rule on the government objection regarding the lack of significant disadvantage in relation to application no

43,in and life in kassel he wa represented by mr b hopmann a lawyer practising in berlin the government were represented by m g marok wachter director of the office of justice of the principality of liechtenstein the fact of the case a submitted by the party may be summarised a follows the event leading to the applicant dismissal the applicant is a doctor specialised in general and internal medicine from june he wa employed a deputy chief physician of the department for internal medicine at the liechtenstein national hospital liechtensteinisches landesspital a registered liechtenstein public law foundation he worked under a contract of indefinite duration which could be terminated with six month notice his direct superior wa dr h chief physician of the said department on september the applicant did some research in the electronic medical file of the hospital he found information showing that four patient had died in the hospital following the administration of morphine he concluded from note made in these file that dr h who had treated these patient had practised active euthanasia on the same day the applicant met with the president of the control committee of the liechtenstein parliament the parliamentary control committee mr m on the latter initiative following several anonymous complaint about deficiency in quality in the liechtenstein national hospital on that occasion the applicant voiced suspicion that dr h had practised active euthanasia on september the applicant on mr m advice lodged a criminal complaint against dr h with the public prosecutor office which instituted proceeding against dr h on suspicion inter alia of killing on request and participation in another person suicide on september the police seized the paper medical file of the four patient concerned at the liechtenstein national hospital and questioned dr h on september the applicant following further research in the hospital electronic medical file informed the public prosecutor office that he suspected that dr h had practised active euthanasia on six additional patient he wa questioned by the police on the same day he supported his suspicion by the fact that according to the electronic file the death of these patient had occurred shortly after the start of the treatment with morphine that morphine had been given even without an indication that the patient suffered from pain that the treatment had been called supportive therapy or supportive measure and having regard to the medication administered he stressed that the aim of his statement wa to avert damage to patient of the hospital at the time of the event the liechtenstein national hospital had a body to which irregularity could be reported anonymously via an online form the critical incident reporting system cirs while initially dr h alone had been the person examining and acting upon such report this task had been entrusted to a group of three person not including dr h since summer at the latest it is unclear when this change in responsibility wa communicated within the hospital the applicant did not contact this body on and september the vicepresident of the hospital foundation board drew up three report on the request of the foundation board regarding the treatment of the ten patient in question having examined the patient paper file and having questioned dr h he concluded that all patient had been in a palliative situation under the who standard and that there had not been any mistake regarding the morphine administered he considered that the applicant had failed to take into account the pain or difficulty in breathing of the patient concerned which had made necessary the treatment in question if the applicant had read the patient paper file which alone a had been known at the time had contained complete information regarding the patient condition and treatment and to which he had had access he would have realised immediately that his suspicion of active euthanasia were clearly unfounded on september the applicant wa suspended from office on october the applicant made a written statement setting out his position to the national hospital on the latter request he explained that he had done some research in the electronic file of several patient who had died in the past week following an indication by a doctor working in the hospital that recently there had been an unusual rise in death of patient in the hospital in his view the ten patient concerned had clearly not been treated lege artis after thorough reflection he had decided to inform the public prosecutor office in order to protect the patient and the hospital and to comply with his own ethical conviction and the provision of the physician act ärztegesetz see paragraph below a he wa convinced that there had been criminal offence a he had not expected the matter to be investigated properly within the hospital and in view of the urgency of the situation he had not contacted an internal body of the hospital prior to lodging a criminal complaint with the public prosecutor office in a report received by the national hospital on october a swiss external medical expert in palliative medicine commissioned by the hospital n having studied the medical paper file of the patient concerned and having heard dr h concluded that no active euthanasia had been practised on the ten patient in question the expert considered that the patient palliative treatment had been necessary and justified a they had been at the end of their life they had died a a result of their illness and not a a result of their treatment they had been given morphine in order to treat their pain and difficulty in breathing and not to end their life the expert noted that some of the morphine dos prescribed especially those without upper limit may not have been necessary but such dos had never been administered in practice on october the director of the national hospital dismissed the applicant without notice he considered that owing to the applicant severe fault the relationship of trust with him had been destroyed irretrievably he argued that the applicant had failed to raise his allegation of active euthanasia and quality flaw with the hospital competent internal body prior to raising them externally with the president of the parliamentary control committee and with the public prosecutor office the applicant had been obliged to inform dr h or at least the director of the hospital or a member of the foundation board with whom he had a normal relationship of his allegation furthermore the applicant allegation of euthanasia had been considered a clearly unfounded by the external expert commissioned by the hospital the liechtenstein newspaper and radio repeatedly reported on the suspicion of active euthanasia at the liechtenstein national hospital and the criminal investigation against dr h in this respect the outcome of the criminal investigation proceeding against dr h and against the applicant the investigating judge in the criminal proceeding against dr h had also commissioned an external expert practising in austria l in his report dated october received by the investigating judge on december the expert having regard to the medical paper file of the patient in question came to the conclusion that dr h had not practised active euthanasia the patient had been given morphine only a necessitated by their palliative situation and this treatment had not caused the patient death doubt regarding such palliative medical treatment and ethical decision taken in that context could be excluded by a better documentation of the treatment in the future on december the criminal proceeding against dr h were discontinued on december criminal proceeding instituted against the applicant for having deliberately cast wrong suspicion of a criminal offence on another person by his allegation that dr h had practised active euthanasia were equally discontinued the proceeding before the domestic court proceeding before the regional court on november the applicant brought an action against the liechtenstein national hospital for payment of some swiss franc chf in compensation for the loss of salary and further pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage he claimed that his dismissal without notice had been unlawful there had been no important reason for his dismissal a lodging a criminal complaint against dr h had been justified in view of the concrete suspicion of active euthanasia and the gravity of the offence concerned on august the regional court dismissed the applicant action it found that the applicant dismissal without notice had been justified under article a and of the civil code see paragraph below the court considered in essence that there had been an important reason for the employing hospital to terminate the employment contract a the applicant had failed to sufficiently verify his unfounded suspicion of active euthanasia in the patient medical paper file and to signal his suspicion within the hospital prior to informing external body thereof the continuation of the employment relationship by the hospital could no longer be expected in good faith proceeding before the court of appeal on january the court of appeal allowing an appeal lodged by the applicant quashed the regional court judgment it ordered the defendant hospital to pay the applicant chf in salary arrears and remitted the remainder of the case to the regional court for a fresh consideration of the applicant compensation claim the court of appeal found that the applicant dismissal without notice had not been justified the disclosure of irregularity to third person wa covered by the right to freedom of expression and could justify a dismissal only if it wa coupled with a serious breach of the duty of loyalty however there wa no such serious breach in the present case the court of appeal argued that the institution of proceeding against dr h by the public prosecutor office confirmed that the applicant suspicion had not been unfounded in view of the severity of the offence at issue contacting external body such a the parliamentary control committee or the public prosecutor office which were both under a duty of confidentiality had not been disproportionate the fact that the applicant had reported directly to the public prosecutor office did not raise an issue in this respect the court further agreed with the applicant that in the circumstance of the case reporting the issue to dr h in the context of the internal mechanism to report irregularity had not been a suitable approach proceeding before the supreme court on may the supreme court allowing the defendant hospital appeal on point of law quashed the court of appeal judgment it dismissed the applicant claim for payment of chf in salary arrears in a partial judgment and remitted the remainder of the case to the court of appeal in a partial decision for it to dismiss the applicant action in that regard the supreme court considered that the applicant dismissal without notice had been lawful it stressed that the applicant a senior employee had only consulted the electronic medical file which he had known to be incomplete although he could have consulted the paper file at any moment if he had done so he would have recognised immediately that his suspicion were clearly unfounded he had thus failed to verify his serious and unjustified allegation before disclosing them to third person and before lodging a criminal complaint this conduct amounted to a serious breach of trust in relation to his employer which justified his dismissal without notice proceeding before the constitutional court on june the applicant lodged a complaint with the constitutional court against the partial judgment and partial decision of the supreme court he argued that his dismissal had breached in particular his right to freedom of expression under the constitution and article of the convention reporting his suspicion of active euthanasia to external body had been justified whistleblowing on september the constitutional court found that the applicant constitutional complaint wa admissible a the supreme court had taken a final stance on the applicant action but dismissed the complaint on the merit file no st gh the right to freedom of expression applied in the relationship between the applicant and the liechtenstein national hospital while the hospital wa a state institution the applicant dismissal wa not an act of public authority but wa governed by private law the right to freedom of expression nevertheless applied indirectly in their relationship indirekte drittwirkung the constitutional court accepted that the applicant regarded himself a a whistleblower having regard to the criterion developed inter alia by the european court of human right in the case of heinisch v germany no echr extract on freedom of expression in the context of whistleblowing the constitutional court found that the applicant right to freedom of expression had not been violated by his dismissal without notice it recognised that there wa a considerable public interest in medical treatment which wa in accordance with the state of the art in a public hospital moreover the civil court had not found that the applicant had acted out of personal motif the constitutional court noted however that the applicant had failed to test his suspicion regarding the practice of active euthanasia arising from the electronic medical file by verifying the paper file of the patient concerned had he done so he would have realised immediately that his suspicion which could be considered comprehensible having regard to the electronic file alone were clearly unfounded in the light of the gravity of the allegation and the consequence for all concerned by them in the event that these allegation became public the applicant had been obliged to proceed to such verification even more a he had known that the electronic file had been incomplete the applicant had therefore acted irresponsibly therefore his right to freedom of expression had not been breached the constitutional court just a the supreme court could thus leave open whether the applicant prior to raising his allegation externally should have attempted to raise them internally notably with the director of the hospital the judgment wa served on the applicant counsel on november relevant legal framework and practicerelevant domestic law provision of the civil code article a of the civil code allgemeines bürgerliches gesetzbuch lay down rule on employment contract paragraph of that article in so far a relevant provides the employee must carry out the work entrusted to him diligently and must respect the employer legitimate interest loyally article a of the civil code contains rule on the termination of employment contract without notice for important

protection of whistleblower point recommendation cmrec of the committee of minister of the council of europe on the protection of whistleblower on april at the th meeting of the minister deputy the committee of minister of the council of europe adopted recommendation cmrec to member state on the protection of whistleblower the committee of minister took note in particular of resolution of the parliamentary assembly see paragraph above it recommended that member state have in place a normative institutional and judicial framework to protect individual who in the context of their workbased relationship report or disclose information on threat or harm to the public interest the appendix to the recommendation set out a series of principle to guide member state in the protection of such whistleblower the appendix to recommendation cmrec provides in particular iv channel for reporting and disclosure clear channel should be put in place for public interest reporting and disclosure and recourse to them should be facilitated through appropriate measure the channel for reporting and disclosure comprise report within an organisation or enterprise including to person designated to receive report in confidence report to relevant public regulatory body law enforcement agency and supervisory body disclosure to the public for example to a journalist or a member of parliament the individual circumstance of each case will determine the most appropriate channel vii protection against retaliation whistleblower should be protected against retaliation of any form whether directly or indirectly by their employer and by person working for or acting on behalf of the employer form of such retaliation might include dismissal suspension demotion loss of promotion opportunity punitive transfer and reduction in or deduction of wage harassment or other punitive or discriminatory treatment protection should not be lost solely on the basis that the individual making the report or disclosure wa mistaken a to it import or that the perceived threat to the public interest ha not materialised provided he or she had reasonable ground to believe in it accuracy where an employer ha put in place an internal reporting system and the whistleblower ha made a disclosure to the public without resorting to the system this may be taken into consideration when deciding on the remedy or level of protection to afford to the whistleblower further council of europe text and other international instrument the parliamentary assembly recalled it resolution in subsequent text on whistleblowing notably in resolution and recommendation on improving the protection of whistleblower both adopted by the parliamentary assembly on june and in resolution and recommendation on improving the protection of whistleblower all over europe both adopted on october further council of europe and other international instrument relevant in this field are referred to in heinisch cited above the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that his dismissal without notice from the national hospital on account of the fact that he had lodged a criminal complaint for active euthanasia had breached his right to freedom of expression a provided in article of the convention which in so far a relevant read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that view admissibility the court note that the application is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merit whether there wa an interference in the applicant submission his dismissal without notice after he had raised suspicion externally that active euthanasia had been practised in the national hospital constituted an interference with his right to freedom of expression under article of the convention the government agreed that the dismissal had interfered with article the court reiterates that the protection of article extends to the workplace in general see heinisch v germany no echr extract with further reference matúz v hungary no october and langner v germany no september in case concerning freedom of expression of employee in stateowned or statecontrolled company or body it recalled that article applied not only to employment relationship governed by public law but also to those under private law in addition in certain case the state had a positive obligation to protect the right to freedom of expression even in the sphere of relation between individual see fuentes bobo v spain no february heinisch cited above and matúz cited above the court note that on account of his statement regarding active euthanasia the applicant wa dismissed a a physician by the liechtenstein national hospital a public law foundation his employment relationship wa governed by private law the dismissal wa subsequently endorsed in particular by the liechtenstein constitutional court the court considers that in these circumstance the measure in question constituted an interference by a state authority with the applicant right to freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the convention compare also fuentes bobo cited above heinisch cited above and matúz cited above in all of which the dismissal of an employee in a stateowned or controlled company whose employment relationship wa governed by private law wa addressed from the standpoint of an interference with the respective employee right whether the interference wa justified such interference will constitute a breach of article unless it is prescribed by law pursues a legitimate aim under it paragraph and is necessary in a democratic society for the achievement of such aima interference prescribed by law the court observes that the applicant dismissal wa based on article a of the civil code see paragraph and above which authorises the termination of employment contract without notice for important reason it wa thus prescribed by law for the purpose of article this is indeed uncontested by the partiesb legitimate aim the court note that there wa no dispute between the party and the court agrees that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation and right of others it served to protect both the business reputation and interest of the employing national hospital including it interest in a professional work relationship based on mutual trust and the reputation of the hospital chief physician who wa concerned by the applicant allegation of euthanasia compare also steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii heinisch cited above and langner cited above c necessity of the interference in a democratic societyi the party submissionsα the applicant in the applicant submission his dismissal without notice had been disproportionate and thus not justified he stressed first that the information given by him to the public prosecutor office regarding suspicion of active euthanasia on seriously ill and defenceless patient had undoubtedly been of considerable public interest the applicant further took the view that he had verified sufficiently that the information he disclosed wa accurate and reliable he contested in particular that it would clearly have resulted from the paper version of the medical file of the patient concerned that his suspicion had been unfounded both the hospital and the investigating judge considered it necessary to consult an external expert on the question of whether there had been active euthanasia and one of the expert had found that there had been an insufficient documentation of the treatment in these file moreover his employer would have noticed research in the paper file the public interest in a democratic society to be informed of potential irregularity in the treatment in a public hospital outweighed the hospital business interest the allegation contained in the criminal complaint lodged by him with the public prosecutor office had been detrimental to the national hospital but it had been the hospital itself which had informed the medium and public thereof moreover the applicant argued that there had not been any effective internal channel for making the disclosure he had not been obliged to report his suspicion to his superior dr h who wa directly concerned by them a this would have resulted in his immediate dismissal the director of the hospital wa part of the hospital management together with dr h the hospital foundation board for it part had not been responsible for employee complaint of this kind likewise he had not been obliged to turn to the hospital internal complaint mechanism cirs a he had not been informed that at the relevant time it wa no longer dr h himself who wa responsible for dealing with the complaint received therefore the only way to ensure effective investigation in the present case had been to contact an external body the public prosecutor office which had been independent of internal personal link and just like the parliamentary control committee under a duty of confidentiality moreover owing to the gravity of the suspicion the fact that several patient had died shortly after the start of their morphine treatment and his position of deputy head of department potentially exposing him to criminal liability himself it had been urgent to act the applicant stressed that he had been fully convinced that having regard to the information contained in the electronic file which he considered to contain sufficient information that there had been active euthanasia he had therefore disclosed the information in good faith the applicant finally submitted that his dismissal without notice being the harshest sanction under labour law had also had the consequence that he had had to leave liechtenstein with his family a he wa to lose his residence permit a a result furthermore he had had serious difficulty in finding new employment afterwards this had a chilling effect on other hospital employee discouraging them from disclosing irregularitiesβ the government in the government view the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression had been justified a it had been necessary to protect the reputation and the right of the employing hospital and of the accused chief physician the government accepted that there wa in principle an interest of the hospital patient in the protection of their life and limb and also generally a public interest in information on whether the treatment in a public hospital wa in accordance with the rule of the medical profession however it had to be taken into account in the present case that the applicant allegation had been frivolous and unfounded the government further submitted that a had been confirmed by the domestic court the applicant had failed to verify in the paper medical file of the patient concerned that the information he had disclosed on the basis of element discovered in the electronic file which he knew to be incomplete wa accurate and reliable the applicant had been able to do so at any time and would then have realised that his suspicion of active euthanasia were unfounded the public interest in having the information in question revealed did not outweigh the interest of the applicant employer and of the chief physician concerned in the protection of their business and personal reputation damaged a a result of the applicant serious and unjustified allegation several effective alternative channel for making the disclosure obtaining an internal clarification of the allegation rapidly and remedying the alleged wrongdoing would have been available to the applicant he could have informed the director or a member of the foundation board of the hospital a had been demonstrated by the investigation done following the disclosure of the allegation by the applicant there wa nothing to indicate that they would not have investigated the allegation properly alternatively the applicant could have complained anonymously via the hospital critical incident reporting system cirs the filing of the criminal complaint against dr h had disregarded the internal official channel of reporting irregularity the fact that the applicant had neither verified his suspicion nor contacted an internal body first also showed that he had not acted in good faith the dismissal without notice of the applicant in these circumstance did not have a chilling effect on other employee of the hospital or in the health sector more generally the employer immediate investigation following the disclosure of the information by the applicant rather encouraged these person to contact internal body regarding suspicion of irregularity firstii the court assessmentα relevant principle the general principle for the assessment of whether an interference with the right to freedom of expression wa necessary in a democratic society have been set out in numerous judgment see inter alia steel and morris cited above guja v moldova gc no echr and heinisch cited above in essence the court task is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation it ha to determine whether the interference complained of wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact a regard the application of article of the convention to the workplace the court ha held that the signalling by an employee in the public sector of illegal conduct or wrongdoing in the workplace should in certain circumstance enjoy protection this may be called for in particular where the employee concerned is the only person or part of a small category of person aware of what is happening at work and is thus best placed to act in the public interest by alerting the employer or the public at large see guja cited above marchenko v ukraine no february and langner cited above the court is at the same time mindful that employee owe to their employer a duty of loyalty reserve and discretion see for example guja cited above marchenko cited above heinisch cited above and matúz cited above when assessing in this context the proportionality of the interference with an employee right to freedom of expression in relation to the legitimate aim pursued the court in it caselaw see in particular guja cited above heinisch cited above bucur and toma v romania no january and matúz cited above ha had regard to the following six criterion in the first place particular attention shall be paid to the public interest involved in the disclosed information there is little scope under article of the convention for restriction on debate on question of public interest see among other authority sürek v turkey no gc no echr iv and stoll v switzerland gc no echr v the second factor relevant in this balancing exercise is the authenticity of the information disclosed the court reiterates in this context that freedom of expression carry with it duty and responsibility and any person who chooses to disclose information must carefully verify to the extent permitted by the circumstance that it is accurate and reliable in particular if the person concerned owes a duty of discretion and loyalty to his or her employer and there is question of attacking the reputation of private individual see handyside v the united kingdom december series a no and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii third on the other side of the scale the court must weigh the damage if any suffered by the employer a a result of the disclosure in question and ass whether such damage outweighed the interest of the public in having the information revealed see guja cited above fourth the court need to determine whether in the light of the duty of discretion owed by an employee towards his or her employer the information wa made public a a last resort following disclosure to a superior or other competent body see matúz cited above unless it is clearly impracticable to disclose the information to a superior or other competent authority see marchenko cited above the court must take into account in this context whether any other effective mean of remedying the wrongdoing which the employee intended to uncover were available to him or her see marchenko cited above fifth the motive behind the action of the reporting employee is another determining factor in deciding whether a particular disclosure should be protected or not for instance an act motivated by a personal grievance or personal antagonism or the expectation of personal advantage including pecuniary gain would not justify a particularly strong level of protection see kudeshkina v russia no february it is important to establish that in making the disclosure the individual acted in good faith and in the belief that the information wa true that it wa in the public interest to disclose it and that no other more discreet mean of remedying the wrongdoing wa available to him or her see guja cited above lastly in connection with the review of the proportionality of the interference in relation to the legitimate aim pursued a careful analysis of the severity of the sanction in particular the penalty imposed on the employee and it consequence is required see fuentes bobo cited above β application of these principle to the present case public interest in the disclosed information in determining whether in the light of the above principle the dismissal without notice of the applicant wa necessary in a democratic society in the circumstance of the present case the court note at the outset that the constitutional court in it assessment of the applicant complaint had regard to the abovementioned criterion developed in the court caselaw see paragraph above in reviewing under article the domestic court decision the court observes that the constitutional court recognised that there wa considerable public interest in medical treatment in a public hospital which wa in accordance with the state of the art the court considers that the information disclosed by the applicant namely the suspicion that a chief physician currently working at the liechtenstein national hospital had repeatedly practised active euthanasia concerned suspicion of the commission of serious offence namely the killing of several vulnerable and defenceless patient in a public hospital a well a a risk of repetition of such offence it agrees that this information wa a such of considerable public interest authenticity veracity of the information disclosed a regard the authenticity in the sense of veracity of the information disclosed by the applicant the court can not but note however that the supreme court and the constitutional court in particular found that the suspicion of active euthanasia which the applicant had reported to the public prosecutor office had been clearly unfounded the court observes that the assessment that no active euthanasia had been practised wa shared in particular by the two external medical expert n and l who had been asked by the liechtenstein national hospital and the public prosecutor office respectively to examine this question on the basis of the medical paper file see paragraph and above while the court doe not overlook that the applicant contested that his suspicion were clearly unfounded it can not but note that he did not consult all patient paper file despite the fact that expert l saw some room for improvement in the documentation in these file both external expert concluded without any reservation that the patient in question had received necessary and justified palliative treatment the domestic court in finding on the basis of these report that the information disclosed by the applicant wa clearly wrong and thus did not have a sufficient factual basis therefore relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact the court would stress that information disclosed by whistleblower may also be covered by the right to freedom of expression under certain circumstance where the information in question subsequently proved wrong or could not be proven correct it recall in particular that it can not reasonably be expected of a person having lodged a criminal complaint in good faith to anticipate whether the investigation will lead to an indictment or will be discontinued see heinisch cited above however in these circumstance the person concerned must have complied with the duty to carefully verify to the extent permitted by the circumstance that the information is accurate and reliable compare guja cited above and heinisch cited above the court observes that the guiding principle developed by the pace in it resolution on the protection of whistleblower reflect the same approach stating that any whistleblower shall be considered a having acted in good faith provided he or she had reasonable ground to believe that the information disclosed wa true even if it later turn out that this wa not the case see point cited in paragraph above and compare mutatis mutandis heinisch ibid and bucur and toma cited above likewise the guiding principle in the appendix to recommendation cmrec on the protection of whistleblower provide that protection should not be lost solely on the basis that the individual making the report or disclosure wa mistaken a to it import or that the perceived threat to the public interest ha not materialised provided he or she had reasonable ground to believe in it accuracy principle no cited in paragraph above in the present case the applicant a stressed also by the supreme court and the constitutional court see paragraph and above based his allegation of active euthanasia only on the information available in the electronic medical file which a he had known a a doctor practising in the national hospital did not contain complete information on the patient state of health comprehensive information in this respect wa only available in the paper medical file which the applicant however did not consult a the supreme court and the constitutional court determined had he done so he would have recognised immediately that his suspicion were clearly unfounded and he had therefore acted irresponsibly see paragraph and above by reason of the duty and responsibility inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression see paragraph above the safeguard afforded by article to whistleblower is subject to the proviso that they acted in order to disclose information that is accurate and reliable and in accordance with professional ethic compare mutatis mutandis medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no and june this applies in particular if the person concerned like the applicant in the present case a deputy chief physician and thus a highranking and highly qualified employee owes a duty of loyalty and discretion to his or her employer the court doe not lose sight of the fact that the applicant in the light of the interpretation he had made of the information in the electronic file namely that active euthanasia had repeatedly been practised in the hospital and might continue being practised must have concluded that it wa very urgent to act in order to stop that practice however given that a had been found by the domestic court see in particular paragraph above the applicant a a deputy chief physician could have consulted the paper file at any moment the court considers that this verification would not have been very timeconsuming having regard to the gravity of an allegation of active euthanasia the court therefore agrees with the domestic court finding that the applicant wa obliged to but failed to proceed to such a verification compare also mutatis mutandis medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above he did not therefore carefully verify to the extent permitted by the circumstance that the information he disclosed wa accurate and reliable detriment to the employer a for the damage suffered notably by the employer a a result of the disclosure in question the court considers that the allegation of active euthanasia having been practised at a staterun hospital wa certainly prejudicial to the employing hospital business reputation and interest and to the public confidence in the provision of medical treatment in accordance with the state of the art in the only public hospital in liechtenstein it wa further prejudicial to the personal and professional reputation of another staff member of that hospital namely the chief physician concerned by the allegation the court observes in this context that the applicant initially did not voice his allegation in public but disclosed them by lodging a criminal complaint in particular to the public prosecutor office which wa under a duty of confidentiality see paragraph above however following the ensuing investigation including the seizure of the medical file at the national hospital the applicant allegation became known to a larger public and were quite predictably given the gravity of the allegation repeatedly discussed in the liechtenstein medium which risked increasing their prejudicial effect a shown above there wa a such a public interest in the revelation of information on suspicion of repeatedly practised active euthanasia in a public hospital however in the present case in which the wellfoundedness of that suspicion had not been sufficiently verified prior to it disclosure the public interest in receiving such information can not outweigh the employer and chief physician interest in the protection of their reputation existence of alternative channel for making the disclosure a for the question whether the information in question wa revealed to an external body a a last resort the court observes that both the supreme court and the constitutional court left open the question whether the applicant prior to raising his suspicion externally should have attempted to raise them internally see paragraph above the court having regard to the circumstance of the case the gravity of the act at issue and it caselaw compare in particular bucur and toma cited above find that the applicant could not be expected to first raise his suspicion with his superior dr h who wa directly concerned by them a for the internal reporting channel the cirs the court note that it ha not been shown that it had been communicated within the hospital that anonymous report of irregularity via that system were no longer handled by dr h alone see paragraph above therefore the applicant could legitimately proceed on the assumption that redress could not be obtained in this way either it remains to be determined whether the applicant should have raised his suspicion either with a member of the hospital foundation board or with the hospital director prior to lodging a criminal complaint the court note that in view of the normal professional relationship between the applicant and these body and the availability of medical expertise within the hospital these instance appear to be effective alternative channel for disclosure with the potential to remedy any irregularity rapidly however the court doe not overlook either that the offence which the applicant suspected his direct superior of were serious and that there wa a possibility that he might himself be held liable in case of a failure to report such offence it further take note of the fact that the guiding principle in the appendix to the committee of minister recommendation cmrec on the protection of whistleblower do not establish an order of priority between the different channel of reporting and disclosure stating that the individual circumstance of each case will determine the most appropriate channel see principle no at paragraph above the court considers however that in the circumstance of the case it can leave open the question whether the applicant wa obliged to raise his suspicion with the said internal instance of the hospital applicant motif for the disclosure a to the applicant motive for reporting his suspicion of active euthanasia the court observes that the domestic court did not find that the applicant had acted out of personal motif see paragraph above having regard to the material before it the court doe not have reason to doubt that the applicant in making the disclosure acted in the belief that the information wa true and that it wa in the public interest to disclose it severity of the sanction finally a regard the severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant the court observes that the applicant dismissal without notice constituted the heaviest sanction possible under labour law compare also guja cited above heinisch cited above and langner cited above this sanction not only had negative repercussion on his professional career it also led to the applicant and his family having to leave liechtenstein a he wa to lose his residence permit a a foreign national without employment having regard also to the medium coverage regarding the suspicion of euthanasia in liechtenstein the sanction therefore must have had a certain chilling effect on other employee in the hospital and the health sector in general at least a regard the direct disclosure to external body of suspicion of irregularitiesiii conclusion having regard to the foregoing consideration the court concludes that the applicant did not act with improper motif however he raised suspicion of a serious offence with an external body without having carefully verified that the information he disclosed which wa a such of public interest wa accurate and reliable the court further observes that the domestic court having regard to the criterion developed in the court caselaw adduced relevant and sufficient reason for their finding that in these circumstance the applicant dismissal without notice having regard to the prejudicial effect of the disclosure on the employer and the other staff member reputation wa justified they struck a fair balance between the need to protect the employer and the staff member reputation and right on the one hand and the need to protect the applicant right to freedom of expression on the other the court therefore concludes that the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression in particular his right to impart information wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and thus necessary in a democratic society there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimouslydeclares the application admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on february pursuant to rule and of the rule of court stanley naismith jon fridrik kjølbro registrar president,,,

the sad result of government by the two recent ruler of the state a a result we have what we have widespread corruption on a broad platform of lie created by the press under the control of the state and oligarch platitude depravity and aggressive propaganda in favour of violence flow out at u from our television screen that is how it all go however it is all depicted a the reconstruction of the state the strengthening of the economy and the rule of law on the background of growing wealth for the people which people i suddenly thought doe it really matter wa the answer from the television

he ha been pushed down to the level of a simpleton who is to serve various small ethnic grouping that call themselves republic within russia or elsewhere in the russia destroyed by the bolshevik they were called non russian or the non russian population and no one took offence at the time everyone stayed within his own locality doing his best to make it wealthy no one wa irritated by that so what

described in linguistics a hate speech or aggressive language creating an enemy image he had used expression that would be insulting to any ethnic group while he had not named any specific group it wa

evidence including the expert opinion and heard several witness for the defence the court dismissed an application by the applicant to summon f for questioning in court about his report apparently neither the prosecution nor the defence deemed it necessary to obtain oral submission from the other expert whose report had been admitted in evidence by a judgment of july the district court convicted the applicant of inciting hatred and enmity debasing the human dignity of a person or group of people on account of their ethnicity language origin and religious belief the trial court phrased the accusation against the applicant a follows in an intentional and premediated manner the applicant worded the main part of his text by way of an opposition between the people of russian ethnicity русский народ and member of other ethnicity национальности residing in russia while making statement that would be insulting and degrading to the dignity of any ethnicity he indicated that

origin is intentionally provocative being aimed at inciting hatred within the people of russian ethnicity toward other ethnicity giving a negative assessment of any group on account of it origin non russian ethnicity or on account of their language or religious belief the applicant made statement about criminal propensity of those group and affirmed the existence of their conspiracy against the kubans that is to say resident of krasnodar region he attributed to the non russian resident bad intention toward the russian population thereby creating a negative image of people prone to commit

statement that can not be verified a to their veracity because they have no factual basis and do not go beyond his own speculation clearly being aware that krasnodar region is a multiethnic region and that newspaper article have an active influence on many people the applicant disseminated his strong view thereby undermining the confidence and respect toward a certain ethnicity a certain religion and inciting hatred and enmity toward a certain way of life culture tradition and religious cult of the non russian population reproducing the concluding remark from the expert opinion f report and listing other evidence for each count of the accusation the court concluded that the applicant wa guilty a charged a to the publication of the applicant article in sochi drugoy vzglyad on december the

enforced a regard the first article the court also held a follows the author made manifestly provocative statement when assessing the situation of the russian people thus inciting his reader of russian origin to feel hatred towards other ethnicity nationality the author made a negative statement about various group on account of their origin being different from that of russian thereby the author made intentional statement concerning the criminal propensity of certain group asserted that there wa a plot by non russian against the population of the kuban area that is to say russian living in krasnodar region he said non russian had plan to harm russian thus creating a negative image of non russian he described non russian a ignorant rude cruel or inhuman those are conjecture that are aimed at instilling fear a regard the type of sentence and it severity the court take into account the nature and degree of dangerousness of the relevant offence the information about the defendant personality the circumstance that plead for mitigating or aggravating the sentence and the sentence potential for correcting the defendant behaviour pursuant to article of the criminal code the two offence committed by the defendant are offence of minor gravity the defendant ha been given average review from his neighbour no mitigating or aggravating circumstance have been established in view of the foregoing and bearing in mind the aim of restoring the justice and the principle of proportionality the following element are taken into account the influence of the sentence in term of correcting the defendant behaviour and noting that it wa the first time he had committed those offence of minor gravity that he ha been taking care of an elderly mother that he is selfemployed a an entrepreneur thus the court imposes the sentence in the form of a fine given that all the offence concerned a journalistic activity the court find it necessary to impose an additional sentence consisting in prohibiting him from carrying out a certain type of activity the applicant appealed stating inter alia that the trial court refusal to summon defence witness f had undermined the defence right the applicant indicated that f had been interviewed during the preliminary investigation a a specialist and had then submitted a report see paragraph above on september the krasnodar regional court upheld the judgment relying on the expert report it made no finding relating to the lack of opportunity to put question to f during the trial for unspecified reason the applicant did not pay the fine on august the lazarevskiy district court of sochi examined a bailiff request found that the applicant had manifestly evaded payment of the fine and replaced the fine with two hundred hour of community work other relevant material on december the council of europe european commission against racism and intolerance ecri adopted general policy recommendation no on combating hate speech in it relevant part the recommendation read a follows the european commission against racism and intolerance ecrirecommends that the government of member state take appropriate and effective action against the use in a public context of hate speech which is intended or can reasonably be expected to incite act of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those targeted by it through the use of the criminal law provided that no other le restrictive measure would be effective and the right to freedom of expression and opinion is respected and accordinglya ensure that the offence are clearly defined and take due account of the need for a criminal sanction to be appliedb ensure that the scope of these offence is defined in a manner that permit their application to keep pace with technological developmentsc ensure that prosecution for these offence are brought on a nondiscriminatory basis and are not used in order to suppress criticism of official policy political opposition

consequence of hate speech and the need for a proportionate responsef monitor the effectiveness of the investigation of complaint and the prosecution of offender with a view to enhancing both of theseg ensure effective cooperationcoordination between police and prosecution authority the explanatory memorandum to the recommendation in it relevant part provides a follows the assessment a to whether or not there is a risk of the relevant act occurring requires account to be taken of the specific circumstance in which the hate speech is used in particular there will be a need to consider a the context in which the hate speech concerned is being used notably whether or not there are already serious tension within society to which this hate speech is linked b the capacity of the person using the hate speech to exercise influence over others such a by virtue of being a political religious or community leader c the nature and strength of the language used such a whether it is provocative and direct involves the use of misinformation negative stereotyping and stigmatisation or otherwise capable of inciting act of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination d the context of the specific remark whether or not they are an isolated occurrence or are reaffirmed several time and whether or not they can be regarded a being counterbalanced either through others made by the same speaker or by someone else especially in the course of a debate e the medium used whether or not it is capable of immediately bringing about a response from the audience such a at a live event and f the nature of the audience whether or not this had the mean and inclination or susceptibility to engage in act of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention of his criminal conviction for inciting hatred and enmity and debasing the human dignity of a person or group of people on account of their ethnicity language origin and religious belief article of the convention read in it relevant part a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others the party submission first of all citing the court caselaw the government mentioned that the complaint had to be dismissed with reference to article of the convention the government argued that the interference in the present case the applicant criminal conviction had been aimed at protecting the right of others preventing disorder and at solving a potential conflict by legal mean there had been a pressing social need to put an end to the dissemination of provocative publication the applicant article could have incited violence and could have adversely affected the russian legal order правопорядок the applicant had intended to use aggressive language by way of drawing an image of an enemy for inciting and deepening strong destructive feeling hate and anger within it reader should the court consider article of the convention inapplicable the government argued that the criminal sentence had been a proportionate measure in the circumstance of the case the applicant maintained his complaint the court assessment admissibility the court considers that the government reference to article of the convention and by implication consideration relating to the applicability of article are closely linked to the merit of the complaint under that article and thus should be joined to the merit see perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extract and stern taulats and roura capellera v spain no and march the court also note that the complaint under article of the convention is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible merit to the extent that the applicant can rely on article of the convention the court reiterates that an interference infringes article of the convention unless it satisfies the requirement of paragraph of that provision it thus remains to be determined whether the interference wa prescribed by law sought to pursue one or more legitimate aim a defined in that paragraph and wa necessary in a democratic society to achieve those aimsa prescribed by law the court note that the applicant prosecution wa based on article of the russian criminal code he ha not raised any specific argument pertaining to whether that interference wa prescribed by law the court considers that this criterion ha been complied with in the present caseb legitimate aim the government mentioned the aim of protecting the right of others preventing disorder and solving a potential conflict by legal mean in their view the applicant article could have incited violence and could have adversely affected the russian legal order правопорядок the applicant wa convicted for inciting hatred and enmity and debasing the dignity of a group of people on account of their ethnicity language origin and religion a noted in at least one of the expert report the applicant did not target any specific group by naming it in his article except for an indirect reference to the armenian ethnic group the domestic court found it established that in his article the applicant talked about people residing in krasnodar region and being non russian in that they had a non russian ethnicity andor had arrived in russia from another country andor spoke a language other than russian andor had religious belief apparently different from the majority of the population in the region it doe not appear that the applicant contested that interpretation the court find it established and will thus take it into account indeed the applicant affirmed with reference to ethnic characteristic that member of those group had engaged in criminal activity and that while residing in russia they continued to behave in a criminal manner on the other hand the applicant opposed those group to the russian population in the sense of an ethnicity at the same time the content of the article reveals that it also focused on the fact that those group or their individual member had migrated to russia this aspect is also pertinent while being secondary in view of the foregoing consideration the court accepts that the interference in the present case wa aimed at protecting the right of others specifically the dignity of people of a non russian ethnicity residing in the krasnodar region in russia in aksu v turkey gc no and and echr the court observed that discrimination on account of inter alia a person ethnicity is a form of racial discrimination racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and in view of it perilous consequence requires from the authority special vigilance and a vigorous reaction the court also held inter alia that negative stereotyping of an ethnic group wa capable when reaching a certain level of having an impact on the group sense of identity and on it member feeling of selfworth and selfconfidence ibid see also lewit v austria no and october in the court view there is no basis in the domestic assessment for the government allegation relating to prosecuting the applicant on account of a risk of violence or more generally any risk of disorder to substantiate that legitimate aim it must be demonstrated that an applicant statement were capable of leading or actually led to disorder for instance in the form of public disturbance such a riot and that the domestic authority had that in mind when acting to penalise him or her see perinçek cited above and it is uncontested that the applicant article contained no direct or indirect call to violence indeed the court did not appear to follow the finding made in f report that the applicant statement contained an indirect call to violent action against a group of people see paragraph and above furthermore in the absence of sufficient detail the court doe not discern whether the government reference to adverse consequence for the russian legal order or solving a potential conflict by legal mean amounted to legitimate aim in term of article of the convention the court will now turn to the issue of whether the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression wa convincingly demonstrated to be necessary in a democratic society in the pursuance of the legitimate aim of protecting the right of others a they have been described above see also perinçek cited above and balsytėlideikienė v lithuania no november c necessary in a democratic societyi general principle freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article freedom of expression is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society see bédat v switzerland gc no march offensive language may fall outside the protection of freedom of expression if it amount to wanton denigration but the use of vulgar phrase in itself is not decisive in the assessment of an offensive expression a it may well serve merely stylistic purpose style constitutes part of communication a the form of expression and is a such protected together with the substance of the idea and information expressed see gül and others v turkey no june and grebneva and alisimchik v russia no november and the case cited therein a enshrined in article freedom of expression is subject to exception which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly see a a recent authority satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article of the convention the decision they delivered in accordance with their power of appreciation this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify the interference are relevant and sufficient and whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see among other authority perinçek cited above when assessing a specific instance of interference with freedom of expression in this type of case various factor should be taken into account including the context in which the impugned statement were made their nature and wording their potential to lead to harmful consequence and the reason adduced by the national court to justify the interference in question whether the statement were made against a tense political or social background whether the statement fairly construed and seen in their immediate or wider context could be seen a a direct or indirect call for violence or a a justification of violence hatred or intolerance the manner in which the statement were made and their capacity direct or indirect to lead to harmful consequence it is the interplay between the various factor rather than any of them taken in isolation that determines the outcome of a particular case see mariya alekhina and others v russia no july and ibragim ibragimov and others no and august in assessing whether the statement could be seen a a direct or indirect call for violence or a a justification of violence hatred or intolerance the court ha been particularly sensitive towards sweeping statement attacking or casting in a negative light entire ethnic religious or other group see seurot v france dec no may soulas and others v france no and july and le pen v france dec no april all of which concerned generalised negative statement about non european and in particular muslim immigrant in france norwood v the united kingdom dec no echr xi which concerned statement linking all muslim in the united kingdom with the terrorist act in the united state of america on september wp and others v poland dec no september and pavel ivanov v russia dec no february both of which concerned vehement anti semitic statement féret v belgium no july which concerned statement portraying non european immigrant community in belgium a criminally minded hizb ut tahrir and others v germany dec no june and kasymakhunov and saybatalov v russia no and march which concerned direct call for violence against jew the state of israel and the west in general inciting hatred doe not necessarily involve an explicit call for an act of violence or other criminal act attack on person committed by insulting holding up to ridicule or slandering specific group of the population can be sufficient for the authority to favour combating xenophobic or otherwise discriminatory speech in the face of freedom of expression exercised in an irresponsible manner see féret cited above see also vejdeland and others v sweden no february dmitriyevskiy v russia no october and ibragim ibragimov and others cited above ii application of the principle in the present case in his article the applicant claimed to present his argument for his decision not to vote in the coming election his reasoning led him to enquire about the notion of the people whose wealth had been growing according to some assessment his ensuing reasoning could be perceived a suggesting that the people of russian ethnicity suffered and non russian group were to blame his article ended with an appeal to an incoming president of russia to tackle related issue the applicant affirmed with reference to ethnic characteristic that member of those group had engaged in criminal activity and that while residing in russia they continued to behave in a criminal manner getting their hand into others pocket and conspiring against the kuban people the applicant affirmed that the member of those group would slaughter rape rob and enslave in line with their barbaric idea and that they participated in the destruction of russia the applicant wa then convicted for his article that a adjudged by the domestic court incited hatred and enmity and debased the dignity of a group of people on account of their ethnicity language origin and religion for each publication of the article the applicant wa sentenced to a fine of rub some eur at the time and wa also prohibited from exercising any journalistic or publishing activity for two year noting the expiry of the prosecution period in respect of the first article the court ordered that the related sentence were not to be enforced a regard the first publication of the article a regard the language used in the article the court considers that it wa such a to offend shock or disturb having said this the court reiterates that it is the interplay between the various factor rather than any of them taken in isolation that lead it to the conclusion that a particular statement constitutes an expression which can not claim the protection of article or which may be punished by way of criminal proceeding for instance under the legislation pertaining to hate speech a in the present case it ha not been contested and the court accepts that the reason adduced by the domestic court for convicting the applicant were relevant in the pursuance of a legitimate aim see paragraph above it remains to be ascertained whether those reason were sufficient in the context of the present case in this connection the court note that the impugned text wa first published during and in relation to an ongoing election campaign in compare féret cited above the underlying intended message of the applicant article wa to present his own view regarding nonparticipation in the upcoming election at the same time the court discerns no particular logic or substance in the applicant ensuing discourse pertaining to the negative role of non russian group visàvis the initial topic being discussed his discourse could not be reasonably perceived a comment criticising any specific policy of the government for instance a regard migration even where a statement amount to a value judgment the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there is a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement if there is not that value judgment may prove excessive see morice v france gc no echr and case cited therein the court agrees with the domestic court that the applicant article furnished no such sufficient factual basis there is nothing in the applicant submission before the domestic court or this court to supply any such basis for the sweeping remark about resident of non russian ethnic group in krasnodar region and negative stereotyping compare aksu cited above and in this context it is questionable whether the content of the applicant article wa capable of contributing to the public debate on the relevant issue compare bédat cited above or that it principal purpose wa to do so compare satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above in the present case on the matter of voting in the election or abstaining from it the court also note that the applicant article wa published in newspaper with distribution figure of and within the sochi area which a the trial court pointed out albeit in a cursory manner wa situated in a multiethnic region the court agrees with the national court that the wording of the impugned statement could be reasonably assessed a stirring up base emotion or embedded prejudice in relation to the local population of non russian ethnicity thus even though it wa not considered that the article contained any explicit call for act of violence or other criminal act it wa within the national authority margin of appreciation to react in some manner see the case cited in paragraph above lastly the court note that the sentence in respect of the first publication of the impugned article wa not enforced a to the second publication of the same article in the circumstance of the case the court considers that the sentence were proportionate to the aim sought to be achieved the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are factor to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article see cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no echr xi the utmost caution must be exercised where the measure taken or sanction imposed by the national authority are such a to dissuade the press from taking part in the discussion of matter of legitimate public concern ibid although the contracting state are permitted or even obliged by their positive obligation under article of the convention to regulate the exercise of freedom of expression so a to ensure adequate protection by law of individual reputation they must not do so in a manner that unduly deters the medium from fulfilling their public watchdog role for instance by way of alerting the public to apparent or suspected misuse of public power a in cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre cited above investigative journalist are liable to be inhibited from reporting on matter of general public interest for instance such a suspected irregularity in the award of public contract to commercial entity if they run the risk a one of the standard sanction imposable for unjustified attack on the reputation of private individual of being sentenced to imprisonment or to a prohibition on the exercise of their profession ibid the chilling effect that the fear of such sanction ha on the exercise of journalistic freedom of expression work to the detriment of society a a whole is likewise a factor which go to the proportionality and thus the justification of the sanction imposed on an applicant who wa entitled to bring to the attention of the public an important matter of general interest ibid although sentencing is in principle a matter for the national court the imposition of a custodial sentence even a suspended one for a mediarelated offence will be compatible with journalist freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the convention only in exceptional circumstance notably where other fundamental right have been seriously impaired a for example in the case of hate speech or incitement to violence see sallusti v italy no march and cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre cited above prior restraint on the activity of journalist call for the most careful scrutiny and are justified only in exceptional circumstance cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre the court considers however that the context of the present case is different from that in cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre cited above the applicant wa sentenced to a nonnegligible fine the trial court also chose to impose an additional sentence consisting in prohibiting him from carrying out any journalistic or publishing activity importantly the sentence in the present case were imposed in the context of the legislation aimed at fighting hate speech in the specific context of the charge against the applicant the sentence were aimed at protecting the right of others specifically the dignity of people of a non russian ethnicity residing in the krasnodar region in russia compare aksu cited above and the court reiterates in this connection that the contracting state are permitted or even obliged by their positive obligation under article of the convention to regulate the exercise of freedom of expression so a to ensure adequate protection by law in such circumstance andor where fundamental right of others have been seriously impaired furthermore the court ha already indicated it doubt a to whether the content of the applicant article wa capable of contributing to the public debate on the relevant issue or that it principal purpose wa to do so see paragraph above the court further note that article of the criminal code provided for a possibility to adjust the period for a prohibition to carry out a certain activity which could be up to three year a regard the applicant the court limited this additional sentence to two year on account of the circumstance of the case on the other hand it is noted that at the material time the applicant wa founder of sochi drugoy vzglyad and only occasionally published article in other local newspaper such a lazarevskaya panorama apparently a a freelancer apart from his main professional activity a an entrepreneur the court considers that it would not appear from the circumstance of the case that the prohibition to exercise journalistic or publishing activity for two year had any significant practical consequence for the applicant the applicant did not argue otherwise before the court in view of the foregoing the court accepts that the present case discloses exceptional circumstance justifying the sentence imposed on the applicant compare stomakhin v russia no may in particular the court considers that by prohibiting the applicant from carrying out a journalistic or publishing activity for two year the domestic court did not contravene in the present case the principle that the press must be able to perform the role of a public watchdog in a democratic society see by contrast cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre cited above the court concludes that there ha been no violation of article of the convention having reached this conclusion the court considers that it is not necessary to decide whether the present complaint should be dismissed with reference to article of the convention see stern taulats and roura capellera cited above compare perinçek cited above alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention that he had had no opportunity to question f the philology specialist the relevant part of article of the convention read a follows in the determination of any criminal charge against him everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing everyone charged with a criminal offence ha the following minimum rightsd to examine or have examined witness against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witness on his behalf under the same condition a witness against him the party submission the government submitted that f report had been commissioned by the defence the trial court had admitted it to the file alongside f statement submitted by the defence f finding had been in line with the expert evidence incriminating the applicant and supporting the charge against him the applicant had had ample opportunity to contest that evidence the applicant submitted no observation in reply within the prescribed timelimit in his application to the court he had merely mentioned with reference to his statement of appeal paragraph above that the trial court had not examined fthe court assessment admissibility the court note that the complaint under article of the convention is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible merit the applicable principle have been summarised by the court in matytsina v russia no march and constantinides v greece no october see also murtazaliyeva v russia gc no december a regard witness on behalf of the defence neither party ha submitted to the court a copy of f report or his written comment on it none were mentioned in the trial judgment the material before the court doe not support the government allegation that f report wa commissioned by the defence at the same time the applicant considered f a a defence witness apparently in so far a his report had been admitted in evidence upon the defence initiative even though it contained finding that were not favourable to the defence see paragraph and above the trial and appeal court provided no reason for dismissing the applicant request to have f examined in the court view irrespective of whether f eventual oral testimony at the trial could be treated a that of a witness either for the prosecution or for the defence in the present case regard should be had to the overall fairness of the proceeding and on that account the complaint should be dismissed for the reason stated below in so far a it can be deduced from the relevant summary in the trial judgment f major finding were consistent with a number of expert report commissioned in the criminal case see paragraph and above those finding were unfavourable to the applicant it is true that unlike the expert report f concluded that the applicant article contained indirect call to violent action against the non russian population see paragraph above this finding wa not however taken up by the trial court when convicting the applicant it appears that both the trial and appeal court chose to rely primarily on the expert report rather than f report which however wa mentioned among the evidence supporting the applicant guilt it ha not been alleged and the court doe not find that the applicant wa restricted in challenging those expert report during the trial in addition it appears that f had been interviewed during the pretrial investigation it remains unclear what question the applicant wanted to put to f during the trial or on appeal the court thus considers that notwithstanding the court omission to state reason for dismissing the applicant request in the particular circumstance of the present case the refusal to summon f for examination in court in relation to the evidence produced by him that is to say his specialist report did not offend the overall fairness of the criminal proceeding in respect of the applicant under article of the convention see by contrast kuveydar v turkey no december the court concludes that there ha been no violation of article of the convention in the present case for these reason the courtjoins unanimously the question whether article of the convention is to be applied to the merit of the complaint under article of the convention declares unanimously the complaint under article and of the convention admissible hold by six vote to one that there ha been no violation of article of the convention hold by six vote to one that there ha been no violation of article of the convention hold unanimously that it is not necessary to decide in the present case whether article of the convention is to be applied done in english and notified in writing on february pursuant to rule and of the rule of court stephen phillips paul lemmens registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the separate opinion of judge lemmens and serghides are annexed to this judgment pljspconcurring opinion of judge lemmens i voted with the majority in finding that there had been no violation of either article or article of the convention i also voted for holding that it wa not necessary to decide whether article wa to be applied in this opinion i would like briefly to comment on the relationship between article and and on the scope of the latter article replying to the complaint based on article the government objected in the first place to the admissibility of this complaint on the ground that the article written by the applicant fell within the scope of article and were therefore removed from the protection of article this is an objection based on the incompatibility ratione materiae of the article complaint with the convention following a strict logic the court would first have to examine the objection and depending on the outcome of that examination decide whether the complaint wa admissible or not if the court found that the statement made by the applicant were covered by article then article would have to be declared inapplicable and the complaint incompatible ratione materiae with the convention without there being any need to examine whether the interference with the applicant freedom of expression wa lawful pursued a legitimate aim and wa proportionate to that aim see for example garaudy v france dec no echr ix extract norwood v the united kingdom dec no echr xi hizb ut tahrir and others v germany dec no june and kasymakhunov v russia no november mbala mbala v france dec no echr extract belkacem v belgium dec no june and roj tv a v denmark dec no april if by contrast the court were to find that the applicant statement were not such that they were covered by article then it would have to declare article applicable and unless the complaint had to be declared inadmissible on another ground proceed with an examination of the merit in the present case the court in effect leaf open the question whether the article complaint is admissible not only doe it join the government objection relating to the applicability of article to the merit see paragraph of the judgment but when it come to the examination of the merit it arrives at it conclusion without having previously returned to the issue of the applicability of article see paragraph of the judgment indeed the court state that it is not necessary to consider the question of article and thus of the applicability of article see paragraph of the judgment what the court state is in fact a follows without it being necessary to decide whether article is applicable or not that article ha in any event not been violated if article had been applied a straightforward conclusion could have been reached by leaving the question of article open the court opts to embark on a normal analysis of the article complaint including an assessment of the proportionality of the interference the latter approach is possible when under the normal analysis of article the conclusion is that the complaint is manifestly illfounded or that there ha been no violation of that article see for example williamson v germany dec no january šimunić v croatia dec no january and implicitly pastörs v germany no october if the court had considered that the interference wa not prescribed by law did not pursue a legitimate aim or wa not necessary in a democratic society it could only have concluded that there had been a violation of article if it had rejected the government objection based on article see for example vajnai v hungary no and echr fatullayev v azerbaijan no and april rubins v latvia no and january perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extract stern taulats and roura capellera v spain no and march and ibragim ibragimov and others v russia no and august in my opinion it would have been possible for the court to find that the applicant statement were not covered by article and then to conclude that there had nevertheless not been a violation of article see for a similar approach féret v belgium no july indeed the court ha made clear that article is only applicable on an exceptional basis and in extreme case see paksas v lithuania gc no january in case concerning article of the convention it should only be resorted to if it is immediately clear that the impugned statement sought to deflect this article from it real purpose by employing the right to freedom of expression for end clearly contrary to the value of the convention see perinçek cited above roj tv a cited above ibragim ibragimov and others cited above and pastörs cited above the decisive point under article is whether the applicant statement sought to stir up hatred or violence and whether by making them he attempted to rely on the convention to engage in an activity or perform act aimed at the destruction of the right and freedom laid down in it see perinçek cited above in the present case the court agrees with the national court that the wording of the impugned statement could be reasonably assessed a stirring up base emotion or embedded prejudice in relation to the local population of non russian ethnicity see paragraph of the judgment the applicant statement were clearly xenophobic that doe not mean however that the statement were totally unprotected under article in my opinion for article to apply and article not to apply there would have to be a call for hatred violence or intolerance see perinçek cited above and compare with the wording used in the judgment cited in paragraph of the present judgment i do not think that the applicant article can be read a containing such a call the applicant merely vented his own frustration at the presence of non russian article is therefore not applicable and article is applicable for the reason developed in the judgment i agree that the authority had good reason to react to the applicant statement see paragraph of the judgment and that there ha been no violation of article dissenting opinion of judge serghides the present opinion is not a fullyfledged one but rather a statement of opinion regrettably i disagree with the court finding that there ha been no violation of article and the applicant wa convicted of inciting hatred and enmity and debasing the human dignity of a person or group of people on account of their ethnicity and wa sentenced to a prohibition on exercising any journalistic or publishing activity for two year and in addition to a fine of russian rouble euro at the time for each time his article had been published it is to be noted that the article wa published twice regarding article the court in the present case adhered in principle to it previous wellestablished caselaw on the interpretation of article according to which freedom of expression is subject to exception which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly see paragraph of the judgment this is rightly stated since it is a requirement or aspect of the principle of effectiveness that limitation or restriction to right should be construed strictly and narrowly however in my view the court followed only in theory and not in practice it previous approach regarding the interpretation and application of restriction to freedom of expression although the court stated that it wa applying that approach to the fact of the present case in my view it did not do so i contend that the restriction imposed on the applicant were not necessary in a democratic society the interference complained of wa based on reason which in the light of the case a a whole were not relevant and sufficient to justify it furthermore in my opinion the sentence imposed on the applicant prohibiting him from exercising any journalistic or publishing activity for two year in addition to the penalty of a fine which wa also high wa disproportionate in the circumstance thus violating the applicant right under article and the principle that the press must be able to perform the role of a public watchdog in a democratic society this principle wa enunciated inter alia in cumpănă and mazăre v romania gc no echr xi where the court considered that by prohibiting the applicant from working a journalist a a preventive measure of general scope albeit subject to a timelimit the domestic court contravened the principle that the press must be able to perform the role of a public watchdog in a democratic society a regard article with due respect to the majority i maintain that the fact that the applicant wa not afforded the opportunity to question witness f a specialist in philology undermined his right a a defendant and offended the overall fairness of the criminal proceeding in respect of his right under article and d and the principle of effectiveness the right to examine witness under article d is a minimum right for everyone charged with a criminal offence not permitting the applicant to crossexamine witness f rendered the protection of his right to a fair trial under article neither practical nor effective any other interpretation of article would not reflect it purpose and the notion of fair trial that the evidence of this witness wa not favourable to the applicant is clear from the judgment see paragraph and the domestic court provided no reason for dismissing the applicant request to have witness f examined see paragraph and of the judgment notwithstanding that witness f report had been admitted in evidence ibid such that it wa unavoidable that it had some influence on the domestic judge thinking since i am in the minority it would be a purely theoretical exercise to determine the amount of nonpecuniary damage i would award to the applicant for the above two violation hence i will abstain from dealing with this issue in his application before the court the applicant argued however that the text reflected his own view a a private person a voter a newspaper correspondent and leader of the local branch of the democratic party of russia the fine for the second offence wa then converted into two hundred hour of community work on account of the

adjourn the examination of the question an article published in the issue of the newspaper dated january wa dedicated to the above event and entitled purgatory for judge чистилище для судей it spread over two full page the first page of the article contained the following text we often criticise member of parliament and for good reason but this gathering of people with different view and business interest under the same roof sometimes produce unpredictable decision perhaps it is too soon to call this democracy however the fact that the mp have rejected the advance of the president of the kherson court of appeal mr i получил от народных депутатов гарбуза a speaks volume so let u talk about justice in the kherson region and first of all about it president mr i below we publish a transcript of the proceeding of parliament concerning appointment of judge for life on january many kherson resident watched live this sitting of parliament and our mr i wa the main hero of that show a we have been writing about him much lately other publication have been writing even more we will provide our reader with a brief reminder about mr i based only on our own publication which by the way have not been challenged we are also in possession of a number of incontrovertible document we give you this in lieu of a prologue in his eight year and counting at the head of the regional court i ha found himself dozen of loyal people lawyer judge and important businessmen for whose personal and business interest he ha successfully lobbied through favourable judicial decision a обзавелся десятками преданных людей чей бизнес и личные интересы успешно лоббировал с помощью нужных решений в судахhere is the conclusion i is considered the person in charge and untouchable a in the kherson region where governor succeeded each other in year if one remove him successfully even if peacefully the people will believe in change for the better in the pervasively corrupt judicial system this document arrived in our office last autumn it wa addressed to a very highranking and influential official in the capital in response to his request for information from kherson but the first official document had appeared right after i took up his position and they corroborate the abovementioned reasoning here is just a short quote from the letter by member of the regional council to the president of the supreme court dated using his position i received u dollar from g who ha been released from serving his sentence and confiscation of his asset he thus helped g avoid his liability visàvis his creditor they go on to describe is trick проделки on two page a and here is the response of the supreme court president to the abovequoted episode there followed a quote from a letter of the president of the supreme court stating that in april i had been reprimanded for a breach of professional ethic by the qualification commission of judge so i ha been duly punished at the very dawn of his career it appears that the lesson did him good since our office have no information about the highest judge of the region receiving any subsequent reprimand a new person became the supreme court president soon afterwards and i could feel more confident perhaps his relative at the supreme court helped to make it so a a relative so influential that he is now awaiting his appointment to the constitutional court and now is year term a judge is coming to an end new law provide for lifetime appointment by a majority vote in parliament and here our president ha made himself famous nationwide прославился на всю страну a the article then mentioned judge o whose resignation wa discussed at the same plenary sitting of parliament a is appointment but mr i is a hard nut to crack and is dreaming of keeping his post no matter what крепкий орешек и несмотря ни на что он мечтает сохранить пост a the first page of the article also contained extensive quote from article previously published in february april and may in the same newspaper in particular one dated april which discussed asset allegedly belonging to i and his relative that article contained quote from a letter of the chairman of the council of judge dated april the letter contained an acknowledgement that judge d president of the civil division of the supreme court wa the fatherinlaw of is son almost the entire second page of the article wa taken up by the verbatim reproduction of the transcript of parliament plenary sitting of january at which parliament examined question about the appointment and resignation of a number of judge according to the transcript several mp said that they had received complaint about the situation in the kherson region court i denied any wrongdoing and stated that all complaint had been checked by the appropriate authority and found baseless the head of the relevant parliamentary committee stated that the committee had also conducted an inquiry into complaint raised about i and found them to be groundless he also implied that i might have been a victim of a slander campaign orchestrated by aggrieved litigant however in view of the concern raised by several mp is candidature wa withdrawn for additional check a brief discussion followed concerning judge o from one of the district court of the kherson region who had presented her resignation to parliament one of the mp made a speech to the effect that judge o had resigned to avoid responsibility for bribery the newspaper reproduction of the transcript wa followed by the following conclusion a you can see dear reader representative of the kherson justice system have distinguished themselves twice it wa not only mr i who disgraced himself in front of the entire country a but also his subordinate from one of the district court mr is photograph wa displayed on the first page of the article covering approximately one sixth of the page he wa shown in formal attire with a neutral facial expression apparently sitting at a desk under the photograph the following caption appeared i will recompense them according to their deed old testament mr i is shown in the photo in the same issue of the newspaper another photograph of i wa published with the caption parliament so far ha not given a life sentence to the president of the kherson court of appeal the copy of the article provided to the court by the applicant company doe not contain that second photograph within the next two week other newspaper published at least three article commenting in critical term on the parliamentary session dedicated to is appointment and his activity in general domestic proceeding i brought a claim in the kherson suvorovsky district court against the applicant company seeking retraction of statement aa and compensation for nonpecuniary damage he argued that the publication in the newspaper which had a circulation of had negatively influenced his professional reputation and public opinion of the judicial system at large triggering action aimed at putting pressure on the court namely numerous demonstration outside the region courthouse the case wa tried by judge s trial judge according to the applicant company in the course of the trial it produced by way of proof of the factual ground for the impugned statement twentyfive article published in the local newspaper from to on april the applicant company lodged an application with the supreme court urging it to reassign the case in view of the plaintiff position to a court in a different region see paragraph below for the relevant domestic legal provision it argued in particular that the trial judge had previously examined a claim lodged by is son himself a vice president of a district court in kherson and had allegedly breached the law in those proceeding it also argued that a a longterm president of the kherson regional court of appeal i had supervisory function in respect of all judge in the region on april the applicant company asked the firstinstance court to postpone hearing in the case until the supreme court had ruled on it reassignment application i objected the court decided not to postpone the hearing on may the applicant company asked the court to suspend proceeding in the case under article of the code of civil procedure see paragraph below pending examination by the supreme court of it application for case reassignment the court refused the applicant company challenged the trial judge on the ground that he had rejected it request to suspend the proceeding the judge rejected the challenge on may the firstinstance court delivered it judgment allowing the claimi the court declared a the photograph and caption to them and statement aa and aa baseless insulting and damaging to is reputation and b statement a untrue and damaging to is reputationii the court ordered the applicant company to publish it judgment and awarded i ukrainian hryvnyas uah in compensation for nonpecuniary damage and uah in court fee about euro and euro eur respectively at the timeiii by way of reasoning the court stated that statement aa and aa could not be protected a value judgment since they were deliberately insulting article of the convention permitted restriction on freedom of expression for the protection of the reputation of others neither the transcript of parliament plenary sitting nor other document before the court provided a factual basis for those statementsiv the defendant had failed to prove the truth of the factual statement a or to point to the source of that informationv a to the photograph the court considered that the applicant company had failed to prove that is photograph had been taken either with his consent or at a public event while it wa established that the photograph with the biblical quote see paragraph above had been taken at an official meeting on may it presented only i and not the event in general and so wa unrelated to the event the defendant had thus exercised the choice of which fragment of the photograph to publish selecting those where only the plaintiff wa shown in a certain light combined with the caption added this demonstrated that publication of the photograph wa intended a an attack on the plaintiff honour and dignityvi the totality of the circumstance showed for the court that the applicant company purpose in publishing the impugned statement and photograph wa deliberately to damage is reputation on may the supreme court apparently unaware that the examination of the case at first instance had already been completed reassigned the case to a district court in the mykolaiv region on the ground that a judge wa a party to the proceeding the applicant company appealed against the firstinstance court judgment arguing in particular that the court had not been impartial because it had refused without giving particular reason to suspend proceeding while the reassignment application had been pending before the supreme court the applicant company also argued that the firstinstance court judgment wa contrary to article of the convention a to statement a the applicant company alleged that is daughterinlaw the wife of his son wa the daughter of d who at the time wa the president of the civil division of the supreme court the plaintiff wa not contesting that fact the use of the term perhaps in statement a showed that it had been meant to communicate that the author wa wondering whether a relative presence on the supreme court wa protecting i rather than being a positive affirmation that this wa indeed the case it wa thus a value judgment and wa true on july the supreme court reassigned the case at is request to the zaporizhzhya regional court of appeal on august the zaporizhzhya regional court of appeal varied the judgment of the firstinstance court and reaffirmed the essential part of it reasoningi the court of appeal reduced the amount awarded to uah for nonpecuniary damage and uah for court fee about eur and respectively at the time having regard to the applicant company financial situation and upheld the remainder of the firstinstance court judgmentii by way of reasoning the court of appeal stated that according to the caselaw of the european court of human right the fact that the subject of published information had public status made such person more open to criticism but did not deprive them of the right to sue to defend their reputationiii the court of appeal found unconvincing the applicant company argument that it had pursued the legitimate aim of informing the public a opposed to damaging is reputation a president of the regional court given that the impugned statement and caption to the photograph had been presented a a narrative about certain circumstance розповідь про певні обставини the firstinstance court conclusion that they could not be seen a value judgment but rather a insult had been justified an insult wa a statement made not with the purpose of communicating information but with the purpose of insulting a person in it appeal on point of law the applicant company reiterated essentially the same argument a in it previous appeal see paragraph above a to statement a the applicant company added that a letter from the chairman of the council of judge of ukraine dated april and quoted in the impugned article see paragraph above wa in the file the letter wa addressed to a certain mr b and contained a detailed response to his complaint against i the council stated in particular that the fact that d wa the father of is daughterinlaw did not mean that i had abused his position on march the odessa regional court of appeal acting a the court of cassation amended the lower court decision by rejecting is claim for damage retaining only the award of court fee see paragraph i above it held that the very fact of the decision in his favour constituted sufficient redress for i it upheld the remainder of the lower court decision it held in particular that the trial judge failure to suspend proceeding pending examination of the reassignment application by the supreme court did not constitute ground for quashing it judgment the court held that the aim of the impugned phrase had been solely to humiliate and disparage a representative of the judiciary and the phrase had made no contribution to the resolution of the problem in the administration of justice criticism of a judge wa possible in the context of a public debate on problem related to inefficiency in the judicial system or to a judge lack of independence or impartiality however the impugned article had not discussed those issue a concern the matter of impartiality of the firstinstance court judge the court of appel made no comment the court of cassation stated that the fact that that judge had refused to suspend the proceeding and had rejected the challenge against himself see paragraph above did not constitute ground for quashing the lower court decision c article b application no publication the article published in the issue of the newspaper dated may wa authored by m k who wa at the time the director of the applicant company and entitled excourt president is burying lady justice under his claim экспредседатель суда завалил фемиду исками it relevant part read claim raining down on the independent medium of the kherson region from mr i who until recently used to be president of the regional court of appeal can not be called anything other than a trend newspaper which take a consistent line in favour of a just and honest judicial system are being targeted it seems that i ha had enough of a clear and consistent position of mr s the head of the kherson city committee of the union of retired officer of the armed force and law enforcement following a defamation claim against the grivna newspaper mr i also sued the vik newspaper which had published s open letter to the regional governor s had asked the governor to state his position concerning the event which became a topic for examination in the parliament and are constantly in the newspaper in his letter the author appealed to the government representative in the hope that he would not remain an impartial observer but could influence the situation a regard justice in the region b claim of retired serviceman seeking increase in their pension to which they are entitled by law have been pending before the court of the region for two year while in other region pensioner get the money to which they are entitled by law in our region only several dozen pensioner managed to get their money why do the court work this way in our region b remarkably this publication in the vik newspaper wa not the end of contact between s and i literally day after the publication of that issue the letter writer and the judge had a conversation at the request of the latter s say that a dressingdown is the only term that can describe the tone of the conversation after this meeting the officer hope of establishing a dialogue with the judge and of clarifying the situation collapsed this wa the subject of a new open letter he addressed directly to mr i and then something totally unexpected for the retired submarine officer happened he wa attacked at night by stranger received a serious blow to the head obliging him to be hospitalised a coincidence the relevant authority could answer this question but they initially refused to register s complaint about the attack he ha not been informed about the result of the investigation bthis is the short story of the contact between s and i the final touch to the story will be a court judgment on the defamation claim the claim will be examined by the same judge st of the suvorovsky district court who surprisingly get to examine is claim in contrast to the case against our newspaper where i is seeking damage for himself in the case against vik his claim are entirely selfless he is asking that damage be paid to an orphanage charity is of course a laudable enterprise but the editorial board of both grivna and vik understand that the point of the operation is not to get some money затеяно все далеко не изза желания получить деньги bmost likely court decision in his favour would come in handy for i when parliament again examines the question of his lifetime appointment claim granted at first instance and on appeal may serve a proof for the argument that journalist unjustified attack this is how lady justice servant call our critical publication are made up and baseless b especially because judge st doe not take into account a seemingly logical idea that if one of the party is a court or a judge then the case should be examined by a higher court b domestic proceeding i brought a claim against the applicant company and k seeking retraction of statement bb and compensation for nonpecuniary damage a regard in particular statement b the plaintiff submitted that it wa based entirely on s account of the event and that the author of the article had made no attempt to obtain the version of the kherson regional court staff a far a the attack on s wa concerned the story wa presented in such a way a to generate a cheap sensation by creating the impression that i wa somehow implicated in the attack according to the applicant company in the course of the trial it produced a proof of the factual ground for the impugned statement twentyfour article published in the local newspaper from to the applicant company also produced the letter from s to the regional governor reference to which wa made in statement b and b in the letter dated february s stated that i possessed property which could not be explained by his lawful income and that the parliament had refused to appoint i on a permanent basis the region wa one of the last in ukraine in term of delivering lawful just decision in case of retired military officer who sought to defend their right to a decent pension in the court s asked the governor to explain why i wa still allowed to remain in the position of the president of the regional court and why the governor did not intervene on august the zaporizhzhya shevchenkivsky district court allowed the claim in part ordering the author of the article to apologise by retracting statement bb and the applicant company to publish the retraction in the newspaper the court awarded uah about eur at the time in compensation for nonpecuniary damage from the defendant jointly and severally to be paid to an orphanage the following element of the district court reasoning are worthy of notei referring to article of the convention the court stated that the public status of the subject of publication did not deprive them of the right to protection of their reputation even though the impugned statement constituted value judgment they were insultingii according to the caselaw of the european court of human right the fact that subject of the published information had public status made such person more open to criticism but did not deprive them of the right to sue to defend their reputationiii the impugned statement were insulting the defendant had failed to provide evidence of ground for such statement and the evidence they did provide did not contain incontrovertible fact which would allow assessment of the person of the plaintiff and the work of the court over which he presided не містять беззаперечних фактів які б дозволили оцінити особу і діяльність судуiv referring to article of the information act setting out objectivity a one of the principle of information relation see paragraph below the court said that the implementation of that principle in respect of value judgment meant that they had to have a basis freedom of the press and protection offered to element of provocation in journalistic expression could not justify baseless criticism with insulting element a had occurred in the casev that position wa in accordance with the caselaw of the european court of human right in lingens v austria july series a no it had stressed the need to distinguish between fact and value judgment the truth of which wa not susceptible of proof at the same time the district court stressed the following quote from the same paragraph of lingens the court note in this connection that the fact on which mr lingens founded his valuejudgment were undisputed a wa also his good faithvi the district court went on to note that the defendant had failed to provide proof that the fact which the journalist evaluated in the impugned article were undisputedincontrovertible доказів незаперечності оцінених журналістом фактів у даній справі відповідачі суду не надали and therefore the court did not consider that they had acted in good faith in accordance with article of the information act the court concluded that the defendant intention wa not to inform the public but rather to spread negative information about the plaintiffvii the court refused to declare statement b defamatory on november the zaporizhzhya regional court of appeal upheld the judgment but modified it to the effect that damage were to be paid to i and not the orphanage since domestic law did not allow for the possibility of directing the fund awarded to a plaintiff to a third party charitable institution the court of appeal agreed with the lower court assessment of the amount of damage account being taken of the plaintiff moral suffering and disruption of his social tie including a a public official the firstinstance court had not established that the journalist had acted in good faith and checked the information she disseminated and accordingly no exemption from liability under the state support of medium act applied see paragraph below the court of appeal stated that an insult wa a statement which wa uttered not with the aim of disseminating information but with the aim of humiliating a person on december the odessa regional court of appeal acting a the court of cassation upheld the lower court decision it stated that the court of appeal decision wa in accordance with the substantive and procedural law and there were no legal ground to quash it d

request file from the lower court the president also recommended candidate for the position of president and vicepresident of district court the lawi joinder of the application the court considers that pursuant to rule of the rule of court the application should be joined given their common factual and legal background ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant company complained that the trial judge of the kherson suvorovsky district court who had examined the case concerning article a at first instance wa not impartial and that that court had not been a tribunal established by law within the meaning of article of the convention of which the relevant part read in the determination of his civil right and obligation everyone is entitled to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law a admissibility tribunal established by law the applicant company submitted that the reassignment of it case by the supreme court had automatically and retrospectively removed jurisdiction from the court which had in fact examined the case prior to the reassignment with the result that the appeal court had been required to quash the judgment and remit the case the government submitted that the higher domestic court had rejected the applicant company argument in that respect and it wa primarily for them to interpret and apply domestic law the court note that the applicant company reading is not evident from the domestic legal provision invoked by it see paragraph above and it wa implicitly rejected by the higher domestic court moreover the applicant company ha failed to present any example from domestic caselaw which would support it interpretation see mutatis mutandis medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june therefore nothing indicates that the domestic court interpretation of the domestic law wa arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable accordingly this complaint should be rejected a being manifestly illfounded pursuant to article a and of the convention impartiality the court note that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission in it initial submission to the court the applicant company submitted that it had challenged the trial judge in particular on the ground that he had refused it request to suspend proceeding while the supreme court wa examining the reassignment application see paragraph above but that same judge had rejected the challenge no reason had been given for the decision to reject the challenge beyond the conclusion that it had been unfounded the government stressed that at the time the firstinstance court examined the case the supreme court had not yet reassigned the case to another court in any case it wa primarily for the domestic court to interpret and apply domestic law domestic law did not require that where reassignment of jurisdiction wa requested examination of the case be suspended see paragraph above there were no ground to doubt the impartiality of the trial judge moreover the judgment delivered by that judge at first instance had then been upheld other than in respect of the amount of damage on appeal at two level the applicant company did not submit observation in reply to the government observation on the admissibility and merit the court assessmenta relevant principle the relevant principle of the court caselaw concerning the requirement of impartiality were restated in morice v france gc no echr with further reference and summarised in mikhaylova v ukraine no march b application of the above principle to the present case the court note at the outset that judge s impartiality can not be called into question under the subjective test the court ha already examined a situation similar to that which occurred in the present case in gazeta ukraina tsentr v ukraine no and july in that case the applicant company had been sued by a judge who held the post of president of another court in the same region and chaired the regional council of judge the defendant had asked the supreme court to reassign the case to a court in a different region nevertheless the firstinstance court had continued to examine the case while the supreme court wa considering the reassignment application which it eventually granted after the firstinstance court had already delivered it judgment in that case the court observed that the supreme court reassignment decision suggested that the applicant company fear about a risk of bias of the court in the region on account of an important position occupied by the plaintiff in the region court wa not without substance there is no reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case the plaintiff occupied a position of importance in the region judicial system see mutatis mutandis salov v ukraine no echr viii extract the procedure for reassignment of case invoked by the applicant company wa intended to ensure the necessary safeguard in case where party could have doubt a to the impartiality of a region court in such situation the court in it caselaw ha often stressed the importance of such safeguard see for example remli v france april report of judgment and decision ii the fact that the reassignment application wa eventually granted suggests that the applicant company fear were not seen by the supreme court a baseless because the trial judge failed to allow sufficient time for that procedure to be completed thus depriving it of practical effect the applicant company fear that that judge lacked impartiality can be held to be objectively justified it is true that the applicant had access to the court of appeal which had full jurisdiction to ass matter of fact and law the impartiality of that court is not open to doubt this may have been sufficient to redress the breach of the impartiality requirement at the firstinstance level see for example helle v finland december report of judgment and decision viii however in dealing with the applicant company appeal the court of appeal and subsequently the court of cassation disregarded it complaint in respect of alleged lack of impartiality see paragraph above therefore they did not remedy the defect in question see for example kyprianou v cyprus gc no echr xiii and henryk urban and ryszard urban v poland no november there ha accordingly been a violation of article of the convention on account of the lack of objective impartiality on the part of the trial judge in the proceeding concerning article aiii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant company complained that the domestic court decision holding it liable for the publication of the two impugned article were in breach of article of the convention which read everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court note that the complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submissionsa the applicant company in it initial submission to the court the applicant company argued that the interference with it freedom of expression had not been prescribed by law since the exclusion of insult and libel from the protection afforded by article of the information act see paragraph above lacked foreseeability a those notion were not defined thus resulting in sanction for value judgment such a the remark that i wa a hard nut to crack a even though there wa nothing explicitly insulting no profanity or even anything sharply negative in the impugned remark the aim of the domestic court decision had not been legitimate a their real goal had been to punish the applicant company for the publication of information and value judgment on matter of public interest while i had been a judge the domestic court had not invoked the aim of maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a their aim a to necessity in a democratic society the applicant company submitted that the press in kherson had been criticising i for corrupt practice since he wa in that sense a public figure in january a number of regional publication had alerted the public that i wa to be considered by parliament for lifetime appointment see paragraph above i started suing the publication after his appointment had been delayed in parliament article a had been dedicated to the coverage of that parliamentary debate which wa clearly of public interest the domestic court decision if upheld would mean that the press could only write about positive or neutral event and any dissemination of negative information would be subject to sanction thus entailing selfcensorship a far a the publication of is photograph wa concerned the domestic court had failed to take into account that he had been photographed at a public event where he had sat on a panel and had thus knowingly exposed himself to the camera article b had constituted a continuation of the same discussion in the context of the claim brought by i against the publication which covered the scandal involving his stalled permanent appointment that discussion had been of particular public interest a it had concerned the difficulty the top judge of the region had encountered in securing his reappointment a serious sanction had been imposed on the applicant company and there had been little reasoning in that decision in particular the domestic court had failed to point to any specific circumstance showing that is reputation had been damaged notably after the publication he had continued to hold the post of president of the kherson regional court of appeal the amount awarded wa particularly high considering the average level of income in ukraine and higher than what wa usually awarded in defamation case by the ukrainian court according to the applicant company the award usually did not exceed uah about eur at the time the fact that i wa at the centre of a corruption scandal should rather have militated in favour of lowering the damage if any were to be awarded at all the applicant company did not submit observation in reply to the government observation on the admissibility and meritsb the government the government did not contest that there had been an interference with the applicant company freedom of expression they submitted however that it wa prescribed by law namely under the provision of the civil code see paragraph above it pursued the legitimate aim of protecting is reputation protection of the right guaranteed by article a well a protection of public servant from offensive attack which were calculated to affect them in the performance of their duty were legitimate interest recognised in the court caselaw citing radio france and others v france no echr ii and janowski v poland gc no echr i respectively a to the necessity in a democratic society the government referred to the court statement in perna v italy no echr v that merely to scrutinise each of the statement taken into consideration by the national authority in reaching their decision that the offence of defamation had been committed would be to lose sight of the article overall content and it very essence it wa significant that i had been a civil servant and therefore the limit of acceptable criticism had been wider than for a private individual the allegation of illegal conduct on the part of a judge had been a matter of public concern and came within the scope of a public debate on a matter of general importance however the principle that freedom of expression carried with it duty and responsibility applied to the medium even with respect to such matter of serious public concern two different court of first instance in different region having carefully examined the casefile material the party statement and the court caselaw had concluded that the impugned statement could not be protected a value judgment a they had been published with the intention of spreading negative information about i the government stressed that the applicant company had not been ordered to pay any damage in respect of article a a far a article b wa concerned the sanction imposed on the applicant company publication of a retraction and payment of damage had been moderate the amount of damage awarded wa modest and in addition the applicant company burden wa shared with the codefendant the court assessmenta existence of an interference prescribed by law legitimate aim the court find that the decision of the domestic court in respect of both newspaper article constituted an interference with the applicant company freedom of expression indeed the government did not contest that point the interference wa prescribed by law namely the relevant provision of the civil code see paragraph above and pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation or right of others see gazeta ukraina tsentr cited above b necessary in a democratic society it remains to be determined whether that interference wa necessary in a democratic societyi relevant general principlesα general principle concerning the court approach to the question of necessity of interference with freedom of expression the general principle were restated in bédat v switzerland gc no march i freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society a set forth in article this freedom is subject to exception which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent courtiii the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact β the role of the press and responsible journalism the court ha emphasised the essential function that the press fulfils in a democratic society although the press must not overstep certain bound particularly a regard the reputation and right of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information it duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with it obligation and responsibility information and idea on all matter of public interest journalistic freedom also cover possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation see delfi a v estonia gc no echr with further reference the protection afforded by article of the convention to journalist is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenet of responsible journalism the concept of responsible journalism a a professional activity which enjoys the protection of article of the convention is not confined to the content of information which is collected andor disseminated by journalistic mean that concept also embrace inter alia the lawfulness of the conduct of a journalist including his or her public interaction with the authority when exercising journalistic function the fact that a journalist ha breached the law in that connection is a most relevant albeit not decisive consideration when determining whether he or she ha acted responsibly see pentikäinen v finland gc no echr furthermore article of the convention doe not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matter of serious public concern under the term of paragraph of this provision freedom of expression carry with it duty and responsibility which also apply to the medium even with respect to matter of serious public concern see for example dorota kania v poland no no october with further reference moreover these duty and responsibility are liable to assume significance when there is a question of an attack on the reputation of a named individual or an infringement of the right of others thus special ground are required before the medium can be dispensed from their ordinary obligation to verify factual statement that are defamatory of private individual whether such ground exist depends in particular on the nature and degree of the defamation in question and the extent to which the medium can reasonably regard their source a reliable with respect to the allegation these factor in turn require consideration of other element such a the authority of the source whether the newspaper had conducted a reasonable amount of research before publication whether the newspaper presented the story in a reasonably balanced manner and whether the newspaper gave the defamed person the opportunity to defend themselves ibid γ civil servant and judge a subject of publication and the limit of acceptable criticism civil servant acting in an official capacity are subject to wider limit of acceptable criticism than ordinary individual see medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above question concerning the functioning of the justice system an institution that is essential for any democratic society fall within the public interest in this connection regard must be had to the special role of the judiciary in society a the guarantor of justice a fundamental value in a lawgoverned state it must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out it duty it may therefore prove necessary to protect such confidence against gravely damaging attack that are essentially unfounded especially in view of the fact that judge who have been criticised are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying see morice cited above nevertheless save in the case of gravely damaging attack that are essentially unfounded bearing in mind that judge form part of a fundamental institution of the state they may a such be subject to personal criticism within the permissible limit and not only in a theoretical and general manner ibid δ the distinction between statement of fact value judgment and insult in it judgment in lingens v austria july series a no and oberschlick v austria no may series a no the court drew a distinction between statement of fact and value judgment the existence of fact can be demonstrated whereas the truth of value judgment is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself however where a statement amount to a value judgment the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement see morice cited above a regard value judgment which have been found by the national court to be of a defamatory character the court ass the national court finding on the question whether the language used in the statement wa of an excessive or dispassionate nature whether any intention of defaming or stigmatising the opponent wa disclosed and whether the statement had a sufficient factual basis see do carmo de portugal e castro câmara v portugal no october with further reference moreover a clear distinction must be made between criticism and insult and the latter may in principle justify sanction see palomo sánchez and others v spain gc no and others echr the causing of offence may fall outside the protection of freedom of expression if it amount to wanton denigration for example where the sole intent of the offensive statement is to insult a person however the use of vulgar phrase in itself is not decisive in the assessment of an offensive expression a it may well merely serve stylistic purpose for the court style constitutes part of the communication a the form of expression and is a such protected together with the content of the expression see uj v hungary no july ε balancing of right under article and of the convention in order to fulfil it positive obligation to safeguard one person right under article the state may have to restrict to some extent the right secured under article for another person when examining the necessity of that restriction in a democratic society in the interest of the protection of the reputation or right of others the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authority struck a fair balance when protecting two value guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain case namely on the one hand freedom of expression a protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life a enshrined in article see bédat cited above in order for article to come into play however an attack on a person reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see axel springer ag v germany gc no february in it caselaw the court ha identified a number of relevant criterion whereby the right to freedom of expression is balanced against the right to respect for private life ibid includinga whether the impugned publication contributed to a debate of general interestb how well known is the person concerned and what is the subject of the reportc the prior conduct of the person concernedd the method of obtaining the information and it veracitye the content form and consequence of the publicationf the severity of the sanction imposed where the balancing exercise ha been undertaken by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the court would require strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no echr extractsii application of the above principle to the present caseα whether article interest are in play the court note at the outset that the applicant company did not contest the government submission that the domestic court decision pursued the legitimate aim of protecting is right a guaranteed by article it did not argue that the publication had not reached the requisite threshold of seriousness capable of causing prejudice to is enjoyment of those right the court see no reason to find otherwiseβ the court approach the domestic court examined the impugned statement and photograph in their combination rather than separately such an approach is a such in line with the court caselaw indeed the court ha held that merely to scrutinise each of the statement taken into consideration by the national authority in reaching their decision concerning alleged defamation may lead one to lose sight of the article overall content and it very essence see for example perna cited above still a in all case of this type the court need to ascertain whether the domestic court gave relevant and sufficient reason for their decision and reached conclusion consistent with the convention in that respect the court note that the two impugned article contained many distinct element of different nature and gravity thus in the particular circumstance of the present case an adequate analysis of the reason given by the domestic court can only be conducted by drawing a distinction between different element of the article see for a similar approach tara and poiata v moldova no october and stomakhin v russia no may the court will therefore proceed to examine the two impugned article and the domestic court decision concerning them in the light of the criterion established in it caselaw and set out in paragraph above the court will first focus on the general criterion such a the subject of the publication which are common for the two article then it will proceed to examine the content and form of the article and the domestic court assessment separately in respect of each of them while considering the article a a whole the court will have particular regard to their disputed part see for example tønsbergs blad a and haukom v norway no march the court will conclude by an overall assessment taking into account in particular the severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant companyγ both article contribution to a debate of general interest how wellknown wa i his prior conduct and the consequence of the publication the domestic court found that the impugned article made no contribution to a debate of general interest in that they pursued the aim of insulting i rather than informing the public see in particular paragraph iii and above the court observes that both of the impugned article were published in the context of the parliamentary procedure concerning is permanent appointment to the post of judge this procedure had already been the subject of press comment prior to the publication of the first of the impugned article see paragraph above in the course of the debate concerning is appointment mp discussed allegation of misconduct against him this procedure wa public and had incidence on is role a president of the regional court of appeal for the court these factor argue in favour of the conclusion that the impugned article made a certain contribution to a debate of general interest it is a different matter however whether all the impugned element of the article made a contribution to that debate in accordance with the tenet of responsible journalism this is a matter which the court considers it appropriate to examine below separately in respect of each article the domestic court implicitly acknowledged that i wa a public figure see paragraph ii and ii above but did not refer to the fact that he wa a judge and wa thus subject to a duty of discretion that precluded him from replying through the medium see morice cited above moreover neither the domestic court nor the party before the court provided any specific information on is prior conduct a to the consequence of the published article the court doe not see any reason to disagree with the domestic court assessment that is reputation wa harmed by them however it also observes that they did not have any dramatic impact on is career since shortly after the publication he wa reappointed to his judicial post on a permanent basis and continued to hold the position of president of the regional court of appeal for year afterwards see paragraph aboveδ article a the content and form of the impugned statement and the photograph the court considers that in term of content and form article a contained five distinct elementsi comment on the failure of is candidature before parliament statement a a a and a and statement a to the effect that is misdeed were reported a far back a ii statement a concerning is relative on the supreme courtiii is photograph with the biblical quotationiv is other photograph which ha not been submitted to the courtv supposed quote from a report to a highranking official about is alleged misconduct statement a and a the court will examine each of those element and the domestic court reasoning in their respect in turn comment on the failure of is candidature before parliament a a a and a and statement to the effect that is misdeed were reported a far back a a the court considers that statement a a a and a constituted mere comment on the failure of is candidature before parliament in it plenary sitting and clearly had a sufficient factual basis namely the debate at that public meeting the impugned expression though sarcastic remained within an acceptable degree of stylistic exaggeration employed to express the author value judgment no profane vulgar or patently offensive language or imagery wa used they were thus value judgment and had a sufficient factual basis the mere fact that they were expressed in a sarcastic form is not sufficient to classify them a insult essentially the same consideration apply to statement a which wa a merely sarcastic description of the content of the document which had contained complaint about is supposed misdeed there is no indication that the veracity of the document wa ever in doubt and the fact that i had indeed been disciplined on that occasion wa not questioned in summary the court considers that for an objective reader the above statement could not be read a insult statement concerning is relative on the supreme court a the domestic court did not specifically comment on the applicant company argument that the father of is daughterinlaw wa indeed a supreme court judge see paragraph and above this fact wa never seriously in dispute accordingly the court also ha difficulty understanding the reason for the domestic court finding that statement a wa untrue it appears although this is not stated in the decision that the court took issue not with the existence or not of family relation between i and a supreme court judge but rather the part of the statement which suggested that that supreme court judge had helped i feel confident in his position however that part of the statement wa quite vague and wa qualified by the word perhaps whether it is seen a a statement of fact or a value judgment it had a sufficient basis in the fact that the plaintiff relative did indeed sit on the supreme court and that that situation wa at least not unfavourable to the applicant a he himself for a long time occupied a highranking position in the judiciary the impugned article merely stated that there wa a possibility of a causal connection between those two fact and did not assert that there wa in fact such a connection the domestic court failed to give any reason for their finding that the factual basis for that statement wa insufficient is photograph with the biblical quotation the domestic court limited their examination of that photograph to observing that the applicant company had failed to prove that it had been taken with is consent or wa published a part of covering a public event and that the choice of the published fragment of the photograph and it combination with the caption had been intended to present i in a certain light see paragraph v above that wa the extent of the court reasoning on this issue the court implicitly acknowledged that the photograph wa taken at a public event they discarded this circumstance however considering that the publication of the photograph wa unrelated to covering of the public event in question while this is a relevant consideration the analysis could not stop there and other criterion set out in paragraph above are relevant of those other criterion the domestic court commented only on i being a public figure see paragraph above their comment on the content and form of the photograph is so succinct that it is difficult to understand they failed to explain what wa precisely the certain light in which the photograph presented i thus the court find that the domestic court failed to give sufficient reason for their ruling in respect of the photograph and it accompanying caption is other photograph which ha not been submitted to the court since the applicant company ha not submitted the other impugned photograph see paragraph above the court ha no basis on which to question it assessment made by the domestic court supposed quote about is misconduct from a report to a highranking official statement a and a those statement pointed to misconduct on the part of the plaintiff presenting him a a person who had developed a network of connection with person of influence they were presented a quote from a document supposedly available to the applicant company that document wa provided neither to the court nor to the domestic court and the applicant company failed to explain this in any way for example by the need to protect it source in fact the applicant company did not even assert before the court that the document really existed the court therefore considers that it ha not been shown that in making these statement the applicant company acted in good faithε article b the content and form of the impugned statement the court considers that in term of content and form article b contained two distinct elementsi statement bb describing interaction between s an aggrieved litigant and i a the court presidentii statement b and b to the effect that is lawsuit against the applicant company and another newspaper were meant to improve is reputation before reexamination of his candidacy for permanent appointment by the parliament the domestic court categorised those statement a value judgment see paragraph iii above the court doe not need to take a definitive position on this point since even in case of value judgment proportionality of an interference depends on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for such a judgment the domestic court concluded that there wa no such basis the court will first examine the overall standard used by the domestic court in reaching that conclusion and will then examine each of those two group of statement in turn to see if the domestic court conclusion in their respect were based on relevant and sufficient reason and consistent with the convention requirement the standard employed by the domestic court the court must stress the wellestablished principle of it caselaw that the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself see lingens cited above there is a fundamental difference between the legitimate requirement that journalist act in accordance with the precept of responsible journalism notably by conducting a reasonable amount of research before publication and presenting the story in a reasonably balanced manner see dorota kania cited above and on the other hand a requirement antithetical to freedom of expression for the author of a value judgment to show that the factual basis for the statement is either uncontested or incontrovertible it wa the latter impossibletofulfil standard that the firstinstance court used see paragraph iii above by contrast the domestic court of appeal did refer to the provision of the domestic law which exempted journalist from liability if they acted in good faith and checked the information they disseminated and concluded that the applicant company had failed to comply with that lower standard see paragraph and above therefore the flaw in the firstinstance court standard is not in itself decisive the court still need to ascertain whether the domestic court gave reason and reached conclusion consistent with the convention in respect of each of the relevant group of statement statement bb describing interaction between i and s an aggrieved litigant the applicant company ha not shown either before the domestic court or before this court that it conducted any good faith research to verify the veracity of the factual element of statement b notably the innuendo that i had somehow been involved in the attack on s an aggrieved litigant who had criticised him the applicant company ha not pointed to any evidence to support that innuendo or it effort to obtain it it thus failed to comply with the tenet of responsible journalism therefore the court ha no basis on which to question the assessment made by the domestic court in respect of statement b statement b and b were closely linked to b a they all described the interaction between i a the court president and s therefore the court see no reason to disagree with the domestic court assessment in their respect either statement b and b to the effect that is court claim against the applicant company and another newspaper were meant to improve is reputation before reexamination of his candidacy for permanent appointment by the parliament these statement constituted comment on is motivation in bringing his claim little if any concrete proof could conceivably be cited for them the court considers that the fact that the claim wa brought after the initial failure of the plaintiff candidacy for permanent appointment in the parliament constituted sufficient factual basis for those statement the domestic court failed to explain their reason for finding otherwiseζ overall assessment of the necessity for the interference in view of the above the court find that the interference wa not based on sufficient reason in respect ofi statement a a and a to a and is photograph with the biblical quotationii statement b and b a far a those element of the impugned article were concerned the domestic court have failed to conduct the balancing exercise in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw in addition the court note that the damage the domestic court awarded to the plaintiff in the proceeding concerning article b can not be considered negligible taking into account the nature of the impugned statement and other circumstance analysed above a far a the remaining element of the impugned article are concerned the interference wa based on sufficient reason see paragraph to and above even considering the damage awarded in respect of article b the applicant company ha failed to show that the authority overstepped their margin of appreciation and that the interference wa not necessary in a democratic society there ha accordingly beeni a violation of article of the convention on account of the domestic court decision in respect of statement a a a to a is photograph with the biblical quotation and in respect of statement b and bii no violation of article of the convention on account of the domestic court decision in respect of the remaining impugned element of article a and biv application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court find that there ha been a violation of the convention or the protocol thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party a damage the applicant company claimed eur corresponding to the amount which wa allegedly levied from it bank account in execution of the domestic court decision in respect of pecuniary damage and eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage in support of the latter claim it alleged that owing to the impugned decision of the domestic court it had been in a state of stress from to the government contested those claim considering them unsubstantiated in respect of the pecuniary damage claimed they submitted that in the event of a finding of a violation the applicant company would be entitled to request review of the decision of the court of appeal concerning article b under which that amount had been levied on it account in respect of the nonpecuniary damage claim the government voiced their doubt a to whether the applicant company a a commercial entity could suffer stress and claim compensation for such damage the court note that the government did not contest that the amount claimed in respect of pecuniary damage had been levied in execution of the domestic court decision concerning article b the court ha found a violation of article on account of those decision in respect of two statement in article b and no violation of that provision in respect of the majority of the statement in that article it is unclear from the domestic court decision which part of the award wa to be attributed to each of the statement compare krone verlag gmb h co kg v austria no no december it appears that the statement in respect of which the court found no violation of article were actually the most damaging finally only a small part of the total amount awarded eur wa actually collected therefore the court is unable to conclude that there is a causal link between the cost borne by the applicant company and the violation it ha found the court accordingly dismisses it claim for pecuniary damage at the same time the court in view of the violation found considers that an award of compensation for nonpecuniary damage is justified in this case ruling on an equitable basis it award the applicant company eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage b cost and expense the applicant company made no claim for cost and expense accordingly the court make no award under this head c default interest the court considers it appropriate that the

46,the applicant were born in and respectively and live in lecco the first applicant is the editor of a local online newspaper in the province of lecco the other two applicant are journalist working for the newspaper in the course of their activity the applicant used radio equipment to access frequency used by the police or the carabinieri this enabled them to learn of any communication transmitted in that way so that they could arrive quickly on the scene when wishing to report on specific incident on august the applicant listened in on a conversation during which the merate carabinieri operation centre decided to send a patrol to a location where according to anonymous source weapon had been stored illegally the carabinieri accordingly went to the location mentioned and the second and third applicant arrived on the scene immediately afterwards having obtained a search warrant the carabinieri searched the applicant car finding two frequencymodulation transmitterreceivers that were capable of intercepting police radio communication the carabinieri then went to the two journalist editorial office and seized two fixed radio receiver which were tuned to the frequency used by the carabinieri other frequency used by police operation centre were stored in the device memory a the criminal proceeding against the applicant at first instance criminal proceeding were instituted against the first and second applicant for illegally installing equipment designed to intercept communication between lawenforcement agency operation centre and patrol article bi and bi of the criminal code the third applicant wa charged with accessing the aforementioned communication article and bi of the criminal code on november the lecco district court acquitted the applicant it held that the relevant article of the criminal code were to be interpreted in the light of article of the constitution which only protected communication of a confidential nature the district court observed that the radio device used by the lawenforcement agency wa unable to ensure the confidentiality of the information it transmitted accordingly the interception of the communication in question did not constitute an offence moreover the possession and use of radio receiver were not prohibited a such b proceeding on appeal the milan principal public prosecutor and the lecco public prosecutor appealed they argued that the lecco district court interpretation wa inconsistent with the court of cassations caselaw in such matter citing in particular judgment no of january and that the communication in issue were clearly confidential bearing in mind the aim of ensuring public safety and protecting public order in addition the communication concerned the initial investigation following the commission of an offence they were therefore subject to a confidentiality requirement pursuant to article of the code of criminal procedure the confidential nature of the communication wa also obvious from the fact that the carabinieri used coded language for communication concerning the location and the type of intervention clearly seeking to ensure that no third party had knowledge of the information being exchanged in addition the radiofrequencies involved had been exclusively assigned to operation centre by the ministry of defence furthermore in order to listen in on the conversation the applicant had had to purchase special radio equipment a ordinary equipment could not be used for this purpose on the other hand the fact that such device were freely available on the market did not justify their use for intercepting conversation between lawenforcement officer in addition in accordance with presidential decree no a in force at the material time device of this kind were intended to be purchased by amateur radio operator but could not be used to intercept police radiofrequencies lastly the ministry of communication decree of february had expressly prohibited amateur radio operator from intercepting communication which they were not entitled to receive c judgment of the milan court of appeal in a judgment of may the milan court of appeal found the first and second applicant guilty and sentenced them to one year and three month imprisonment the third applicant wa sentenced to six month imprisonment the court of appeal suspended the applicant sentence it observed that article bi of the criminal code a amended by law no of november had extended the scope of criminal responsibility to cover all remote data transmission thus including the interception of conversation between the lawenforcement agency operation centre and patrol such communication were moreover clearly confidential reiterating all the argument put forward by the milan and lecco public prosecutor particularly regarding the aim of ensuring public safety and protecting public order the court of appeal held that article of the code of criminal procedure wa also at issue in the present case d proceeding in the court of cassation the applicant appealed to the court of cassation they contended that the communication in question had been transmitted on unencrypted frequency and thus could not be treated a confidential furthermore they had been acting in a professional capacity a journalist and their action were therefore justified under article of the criminal code and in term of freedom of the press in a judgment of october the court of cassation found against the applicant upholding the court of appeal position a to the confidential nature of the communication and reiterating that this interpretation wa consistent with it own approach in similar case particularly in judgment no of may and no of january addressing the applicant argument concerning freedom of the press the court of cassation stated that the right to impart information which they had relied on might have prevailed over the public interest protected by criminal law in a case of alleged defamation however that right could not take precedence in a case concerning the illegal interception of communication between lawenforcement officer the lawalleged violation of article of the convention relying on article of the convention the applicant complained about the search of their vehicle and their editorial office the seizure of their radio equipment and their conviction they submitted that these measure had constituted disproportionate interference with their freedom of expression particularly in relation to their access to information a journalist this article read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary b merit the party submission the applicant submitted that the measure taken against them had not been proportionate to the aim referred to by the respondent government and that the right to impart information should prevail in their case they further contended that the custodial sentence imposed on them had been excessive the government observed that even assuming that there had been interference with the right relied on by the applicant it had pursued legitimate aim namely the protection of national security and public safety and the prevention of disorder and crime and had been proportionate to those aim the court assessmenta whether there ha been an interference prescribed by law and the legitimate aim pursued the court reiterates it doubt a to whether there wa an interference with the applicant freedom of expression in the present case even assuming that article wa applicable it observes that the search and seizure operation and the custodial sentence imposed on the applicant were prescribed by law namely by article of the code of criminal procedure and article bi and bi of the criminal code the court considers that the measure in question pursued legitimate aim for the purpose of article of the convention in particular the protection of the right of others and concerning more specifically the interception of police communication the protection of national security and the prevention of disorder and crimeb whether the measure taken against the applicant were necessary in a democratic societyi general principle the general principle concerning the necessity of an interference with freedom of expression were summarised in pentikäinen v finland gc no echr in that judgment the court reiterated that the protection afforded by article of the convention to journalist wa subject to the proviso that they acted in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenet of responsible journalism see mutatis mutandis bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i kasabova v bulgaria no and april and time newspaper ltd v the united kingdom no and no and echr furthermore the concept of responsible journalism is not confined to the content of information which is collected andor disseminated by journalistic mean it also embrace inter alia the lawfulness of journalist conduct including their public interaction with the authority when exercising journalistic function see pentikäinen cited above it should also be reiterated that notwithstanding the vital role played by the medium in a democratic society journalist can not in principle be released from their duty to obey the ordinary criminal law on the basis that a journalist article affords them a castiron defence see among other authority mutatis mutandis stoll v switzerland gc no echr v bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above and monnat v switzerland no echr x in other word a journalist can not claim an exclusive immunity from criminal liability for the sole reason that unlike other individual exercising the right to freedom of expression the offence in question wa committed during the performance of his or her journalistic function see pentikäinen cited above furthermore all person including journalist who exercise their freedom of expression undertake duty and responsibility the scope of which depends on their situation and the technical mean they use see for example handyside v the united kingdom december in fine series a no thus notwithstanding the vital role played by the press in a democratic society journalist can not in principle be released from their duty to obey the ordinary criminal law on the basis that article affords them protection paragraph of article doe not moreover guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matter of serious public concern see stoll cited above and pentikäinen cited above lastly the court reiterates that in assessing the necessity of a specific interference with the exercise of freedom of expression it ha regard to several criterion namely the assessment of the competing interest the applicant conduct the review carried out by the domestic court and the proportionality of the penalty imposed see stoll cited above pentikäinen cited above and boris erdtmann v germany dec no january ii application of these principle in the present case it should be noted at the outset that unlike other case where journalist have applied to the court under article of the convention including among many other example stoll cited above the present case doe not concern the prohibition of a publication but the taking of measure against journalist for action that according to the italian legal system contravened criminal law in order to ass the necessity of these measure the court observes that the interest to be weighed up in the present case are firstly the public interest in the proper functioning of the lawenforcement agency and secondly the interest of reader in receiving information although both these interest may be regarded a public in nature see mutatis mutandis stoll cited above it should nevertheless be pointed out that the public interest in knowing about local news item can not carry the same weight a the public interest in obtaining information about a matter of general and historical concern or of considerable medium interest subject which the court ha already had occasion to examine in this connection it note that the stoll case cited above concerned the dissemination of information about the compensation due to holocaust victim for unclaimed asset deposited in swiss bank account the pentikäinen case cited above concerned the dissemination of information about a demonstration taking place on an exceptional scale in national term in protest against an asia europe meeting in the present case the court observes that the applicant were not prohibited from bringing news item to the public attention their conviction wa based solely on the possession and use of radio equipment in order to obtain relevant information more rapidly by intercepting police communication which were confidential under domestic law the limit of the prohibition are an important consideration in the assessment of it proportionality in this context the court considers that the decision of the milan court of appeal and the court of cassation to the effect that communication between lawenforcement officer were confidential and that the applicant action were therefore to be classified a criminal conduct were properly reasoned the decision relying on settled caselaw of the court of cassation accorded substantial weight to the protection of national security and the prevention of disorder and crime the court further note that a it ha previously held see stoll cited above and pentikäinen cited above the severity of the penalty imposed on the applicant is also a factor to be taken into consideration in assessing the proportionality of the interference complained of in the present case the penalty consisted of custodial sentence of one year and three month for the first two applicant and six month for the third together with the seizure of their radio equipment the court reiterates that the concept of responsible journalism requires that whenever a journalist conduct flouts the duty to abide by ordinary criminal law the journalist ha to be aware that he or she is liable to face legal sanction including of a criminal character see pentikäinen cited above in the present case while seeking to obtain information for publication in a local newspaper the applicant acted in a manner that according to domestic law and the settled approach of the court of cassation contravened criminal law which lay down a general prohibition on a person interception of any conversation not intended for him or her including those between lawenforcement officer the applicant action moreover involved a technique which they used routinely in the course of their activity a journalist see paragraph above lastly the court note that in it judgment of may the milan court of appeal suspended the applicant sentence and that there is no evidence in the case file to show that they served them accordingly the penalty imposed on the applicant do not appear disproportionate the court made an appropriate distinction between the applicant duty to abide by domestic law and their pursuit of their activity a journalist which wa not otherwise restricted having regard to the above factor the court concludes that there ha been no violation of article of the convention in the present case for these reason the court unanimously hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in french and notified in writing on june pursuant to rule and of the rule of court abel campos mirjana lazarova trajkovska registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the separate opinion of judge spano is annexed to this judgment mltacconcurring opinion of judge spanoi the applicant the director of a local news portal and two of it journalist were convicted of illegally accessing radio channel used by the police during the latter activity a the information so obtained by the journalist wa considered confidential under the italian criminal code the court find no violation of article of the convention i concur in the judgment however i am writing separately a i consider the reasoning adopted by the court to be somewhat too broad in substance investigative journalism is an important feature of democratic society a history ha demonstrated responsible journalism can if pursued effectively uncover information of great value for the public interest and thus promote and strengthen the fundamental democratic value of accountability and transparency a the court ha previously held the concept of responsible journalism a a professional activity which enjoys the protection of article of the convention is not confined to the content of information which is collected andor disseminated by journalistic mean that concept also embrace inter alia the lawfulness of the conduct of a journalist including his or her public interaction with the authority when exercising journalistic function importantly the mere fact that a journalist ha breached the law in his or her journalistic activity is a highly relevant albeit not decisive consideration when determining whether he or she ha acted responsibly a the court held in it grand chamber judgment in stoll v switzerland gc no echr v although it may be undisputed that a journalist ha violated the criminal law for example a in stoll by publishing information that wa confidential the mere fact that a journalist ha acted in breach of a criminallaw provision is not the end of the matter for the purpose of the necessity and proportionality assessment which must be carried out under article of the convention otherwise contracting state would be free to subject journalist to criminal sanction whenever they came close to uncovering activity that cast those in power in an unfavourable light and would thereby subvert the vital role of the press in the functioning of a democratic society but it is clear that journalist can not claim exclusive immunity from criminal liability for the sole reason that unlike other individual exercising the right to freedom of expression they committed the offence in question during the performance of their journalistic function all person including journalist who exercise their freedom of expression undertake duty and responsibility the scope of which depends on their situation and the technical mean they use see pentikäinen v finland gc no echr and stoll cited above ii the applicant complain that the seizure of their vehicle and radio equipment and their subsequent conviction constituted a disproportionate interference with their freedom of expression within the context of their attempt to access information a journalist the court begin it inquiry by leaving open the question whether the applicant suffered an interference within the meaning of article of the convention a the court find in any event that even assuming that such an interference occurred it wa justified on the fact see paragraph of the french version of the judgment this may be a prudent course of action a it can be difficult to determine whether prepublication activity a part of investigative journalism is conduct which in itself trigger the protection of article of the convention however on the particular fact of this case i would have been comfortable in finding that article wa indeed applicable and that an interference occurred here i consider differently from my colleague see paragraph of the french version of the judgment that such a finding would have been logically consistent with the recent finding of the grand chamber in pentikäinen cited above where the court considered that the applicant in the exercise of his journalistic function had been adversely affected a he wa present at the scene a a newspaper photographer in order to report on the event when he wa apprehended by the police detained for hour and later charged and found guilty by the domestic court of the crime of disobeying the police i agree with the finding of the court on the issue of lawfulness and whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim see paragraph of the judgment at paragraph the court then correctly refers to the following stoll criterion a the framework for the analysis of the fact see my dissenting opinion in pentikäinen cited above the interest at stake the review of the measure by the domestic court the conduct of the applicant and whether the penalty imposed wa proportionate see stoll cited above however it is in the application of these criterion to the fact of the case that i find the reasoning problematic and overly broad in scope i would have applied a narrower more factsensitive analysis in the following manner firstly although i agree that the fact do not disclose the same kind of public interest a those at stake in stoll or pentikäinen the assessment should not have been limited to stating in abstract term that the interest in the present case wa limited to the public right to be informed of trivial item of a general nature on a local news portal see paragraph of the judgment the publicinterest inquiry should rather have been directed more intensely at the nature of the confidential information that the journalist were actually seeking to obtain so a to be able to inform the public indeed and very importantly there are situation where journalist may be justified under article of the convention in deciding to pursue aggressive investigatory strategy in their work even accessing confidential information if the public interest in disseminating the information in question is strong for example in the case of effort to uncover corruption or illegal activity by government official or elected representative also the fact that the newspaper is published for the benefit of a local community is irrelevant in my view also considering that the content of the news portal in question wa published online having said that even analysing the case through this narrower more factsensitive prism it nonetheless transpires that the nature of the information obtained by the applicant wa not paramount from the perspective of the public interest the applicant accessed the police radio channel and used the information so obtained in order to be present at the scene of an everyday lawenforcement operation the applicant have to bear the burden under article of the convention for having resorted to illegal mean in obtaining confidential information without their action being justified by the existence of a strong public interest the second issue i find problematic relates to the fact that the court considers correctly that the italian court applied a rule of domestic criminal law which proscribes in a general manner the interception of confidential conversation including police communication see paragraph of the judgment in other word the domestic court did not engage in a balancing of the conflicting interest at stake a is normally required in article case of this nature under the second of the stoll criterion which concern the review of the measure by the domestic court in my view the court should have recognised this problematic nature of the domestic court review having already rejected the government nonexhaustion of domestic remedy argument that the applicant had not invoked their right to freedom of expression at domestic level see paragraph of the french version of the judgment however taking account of the applicant complaint viewed a a whole on the basis of the stoll criterion and in particular the relatively little weight that can be attached to the public interest at stake when balanced against the applicant criminal behaviour in obtaining the information in question i concur in the judgment,,,
47,the applicant wa born in and life in cluj napoca he is a university professor and contributor to various magazine and newspaper mainly of an economic and financial nature at the time of the relevant event he had already published more than article in various local or national publication prior to parliamentary election held at the end of november the applicant wrote an article about mii who wa standing a a candidate for one of the national party the article headlined attention he also want to be in parliament wa published on the front page of f a newspaper on november it read a follows after five round of free parliamentary election ordinary people who are politically active only when they vote have come to an uncontroversial conclusion there is something wrong with people who become candidate for various political function without even knowing exactly what is wrong most people of good moral and professional character often choose not to vote any more they make that choice especially when they learn that the person appearing on the electoral poster asking for vote ha never done anything remarkable in his or her profession it is therefore no longer surprising that the romanian parliament is the institution that enjoys the least public confidence time ha consolidated the public belief that most candidate want to become parliamentarian so that they can for a couple of year take advantage of the privilege they grant themselves or of those informal benefit which come through the development of the system of relationship associated with their function there are candidate who do everything to become parliamentarian in order to shield their criminal record from the criminal act they committed before becoming senator or deputy among the many case of that type i today present you one and if i do this it is not to help the voter because imposture by an individual reveals itself without reserve to the perceptive mass whereas one by a group or party doe not especially when one can use all the presidential and municipal logistical power impressive amount of fund and an unsuspected power to persuade individual with little training one such case is that of mr mii this gentleman is in good physical condition especially after living a comfortable life a a manager at r cluj a public company and now want to use his skill in parliament and he doe not intend to reach such a position only based on his wellknown lucidity but also with the help of some financial support for the intellectual effort he wish to make for the benefit of the many for that purpose he borrowed billion romanian lei for a period of month namely until october to invest on the stock market and earn a bit more than the creditor would request a interest based on perfectly legal document it is just that at one point the moral profile of this representative of the democratic party of cluj showed itself clearly not having made a much profit a he hoped the candidate mii decided not to repay the loan thus contracted after imploring the creditor to have mercy to postpone and not enforce the contract even though he know that the contract weighs against him he is relying on that defect of romanian justice of postponing the adjudication of case in fact mr mii brought a case before a court which had no jurisdiction to ass the case but he hope in the near future to be able to invoke his immunity a a member elected by the nation just like his spiritual guardian who left u without a maritime fleet that is why i say that we must be careful about what mr mii sign and promise for the following day he might no longer admit to anything he may switch to another political party if he is given more he may even sell part of the electoral district where he ran and if nobody want it he can go to smirnov because it is warmer in tiraspol than in huedin on april mii brought a civil action against the applicant he sought euro eur for nonpecuniary damage a the article had allegedly seriously affected his reputation and made him lose the election by approximately one hundred vote mii also complained about the publication by the applicant of another defamatory article on january which wa in a similar vein he also complained about the distribution of leaflet before the election which had reproduced the content of the article of november he alleged that all the material had been meant to discredit him a a candidate the applicant confirmed that he wa the author of the article in question and that everything he had written had been true a proved by document from the arbitration tribunal of the cluj chamber of commerce which would become available to the court he further denied contributing in any way to the publication or distribution of other article and leaflet concerning mii on july the cluj napoca court of first instance allowed the claim lodged by mii and held that the article of november had contained defamatory statement about him it further held the applicant liable to pay eur for nonpecuniary damage and romanian lei ron in legal cost the court held that the applicant had not proved that his statement were true the procedure before the arbitration tribunal invoked by the applicant in his defence had concerned a commercial dispute between mii and the applicant brokerage company in which the claim of mii had been partially granted on april a the repayment deadline had been set for april the court considered that even if true the applicant statement had been defamatory and should not have been made public in the medium especially since they concerned matter of a private commercial nature the court further noted that the applicant statement had been reproduced in electoral leaflet which had been distributed in several public place in bus station and private mailbox the court held that even if it wa not the applicant who had produced or distributed the leaflet there wa a causal link between the publication of the article and the harm caused to miis reputation because if he had not produced his article in the first place there would have been no leaflet and no amplification of the negative effect on miis image the court then focused on the term used by the applicant in his article in particular calling the defendant an impostor which wa found to be insulting and lacking factual justification a there existed no criminal complaint of fraud against mii it concluded that the language used conveying the idea that mii would accept any compromise for money and would therefore betray the electorate his party and his country had exceeded the limit of admissible criticism and had disparaged him the applicant appealed arguing before the cluj county court that the publication of the article in question during a parliamentary election campaign had had the role of informing the public in good faith about a political figure in such a situation the limit of admissible criticism were wider he argued that during election campaign the press had the essential role of informing the public about future member of the romanian parliament he argued that the amount of damage awarded by the firstinstance court had been disproportionate and had had an obvious punitive purpose in a final judgment of january the county court essentially upheld the reasoning of the lower court it considered that the manner in which the applicant had acted proved that he had not complied with the duty and responsibility inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression the seriousness of his allegation and of the act imputed to mii hold him the applicant responsible for showing the highest rigour and a special caution the lack of which would breach the right of others the county court confirmed that the lower court had correctly estimated that it had been necessary to balance the right to private life on the one hand and freedom of expression which contributed to a debate of public interest on the other holding that to insult to defame a person can not be justified and legitimate when one party aim to unilaterally expose in the press private litigation of a commercial nature involving two private party in assessing the existing conflict between the exercise of freedom of expression in the press and the necessity to protect the reputation and the right of others the court estimate that even though the applicant allegation made in a press article during an electoral campaign concerned a potential member of the romanian parliament thus were of public interest there are limitation to freedom of expression the applicant having been bound to act within the limit given by the public interest in protecting the reputation and the right of another person including his or her right to be presumed innocent undoubtedly when the article wa published in the newspaper f the applicant did not comply with the minimum requirement of diligence prescribed by article of the convention in the sense of acting in good faith and in accordance with the journalistic ethic so a to ensure that the provided information be trustworthy notwithstanding the dose of exaggeration or provocation allowed in such situation nevertheless the county court allowed the applicant appeal in part and reduced the damage to eur considered to be more proportionate to the damage sustained by miiii relevant domestic law the relevant provision of the romanian civil code in force at the time concerning tort liability are cited in ghiulfer predescu v romania no june the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the obligation imposed on him by the domestic court to compensate mii for nonpecuniary damage had amounted to a breach of his right to freedom of expression guaranteed under article of the convention he relied in addition on article and article of the convention the court is of the view that it suffices to examine the complaint solely under article which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court note that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit argument of the party the applicant submitted that his publication of the article for which he had been found liable had pursued the aim of informing the public about mii a public person aspiring to become a parliament deputy he argued that the statement had not infringed any of the right set down in the convention being purely a manifestation of his own right to freely impart public information he further stated that he wa not challenging the proportionality of the measure but rather the sanction itself considering that the domestic court had abused their power after being influenced by the political nature of the case the government submitted that the interference had been provided for by law namely article of the civil code in force at the time see paragraph above it had been legitimate aiming at protecting the right of others and finally it had been proportionate a a fair balance had been struck between the right to reputation of a third party mii and the applicant right in that respect they argued that the statement had concerned fact of a serious nature which however had been outside the limit of political debate moreover the applicant had been unable to establish the truthfulness of what he had written although he had been given the possibility to do so lastly the sanction had not been excessive or unreasonable in support of their argument the government cited mihaiu v romania no november and ciuvică v romania dec no january the court assessment the party do not dispute the fact that the domestic court judgment amounted to an interference with the applicant exercise of the right to freedom of expression the court also find that the interference complained of wa prescribed by law namely article of the civil code in force at the time see paragraph above and pursued the legitimate aim referred to in article of the convention namely the protection of the reputation or right of others what remains to be established is whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society when examining the necessity of an interference in a democratic society in the interest of the protection of the reputation or right of others the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authority struck a fair balance when protecting two value guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain case namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see hachette filipacchi associés v france no june and mgn limited v the united kingdom no january the court emphasis that in order for article of the convention to come into play an attack on a person reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and it manner must cause prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see a v norway no april and axel springer ag v germany gc no february where the balancing exercise between those two right ha been undertaken by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the court would require strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see mgn limited cited above and and palomo sánchez and others v spain gc no and others echr the relevant criterion in this regard are a the contribution made by the article to a debate of general interest b how well known is the person concerned and what is the subject of the report c the conduct of the person concerned prior to publication of the article d method of obtaining the information and it veracity e content form and consequence of the publication and f severity of the sanction imposed see axel springer ag cited above the court also reiterates that a distinction ha to be made between private individual and person acting in a public context a political figure or public figure accordingly whilst a private individual unknown to the public may claim particular protection of his or her right to private life the same is not true of public figure see minelli v switzerland dec no june and petrenco v moldova no march in respect of whom limit of critical comment are wider a they are inevitably and knowingly exposed to public scrutiny and must therefore display a particularly high degree of tolerance see ayhan erdoğan v turkey no january and kuliś v poland no march see also milisavljević v serbia no april and von hannover v germany no gc no and echr in the present case the court note that the applicant criticism wa directed at mii a candidate in parliamentary election for a national political party he wa thus a politician in respect of whom the limit of acceptable criticism are wider than in the case of a private individual see lingens v austria july series a no and satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no echr extract by standing in the parliamentary election mii entered the political scene and inevitably and knowingly laid himself open to close scrutiny scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalist and the public at large for these reason he wa required to display a greater degree of tolerance for similar reasoning see among the most recent authority genner v austria no january nevertheless the court also note that the applicant wa sanctioned for his statement in particular his utterance of the idea that mii wa an impostor a person who wa ready to accept any compromise and betray his elector for financial advantage according to the cluj napoca court of first instance those insulting expression harmed miis reputation and dignity and should not have been made public via the medium especially because they referred to private matter see paragraph above furthermore the court took into consideration the harmful effect that the distribution by third party of electoral leaflet reproducing the content of the applicant article had had on miis reputation see paragraph above it emphasised the necessity to balance the right to private life on the one hand and the freedom of expression on the other this reasoning wa upheld by the county court which underlined the seriousness of the applicant allegation and of the act imputed to mii and considered that these statement had not been trustworthy notwithstanding the dose of exaggeration or provocation allowed in such situation see paragraph above moreover in their assessment the domestic court took into account the context in which the impugned allegation had been made namely during an electoral campaign and confirmed the fact that they had been of public interest in so far a they had concerned a public figure the court considers it relevant that in reaching the conclusion to allow in part the claim in the defamation proceeding against the applicant the domestic court considered that the latter had not intended to criticise miis activity a a public figure but rather to publicly expose a unilateral view of private litigation of a commercial nature involving two private party in this respect they also held that the applicant had not complied with the minimal requirement of diligence in the sense of acting in good faith see again paragraph above in the light of the above the court agrees with the domestic judicial authority that the impugned statement were an attack on miis reputation reaching the requisite level of seriousness and causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of his right to respect for private life under article it also find that the domestic court did undertake a satisfactory balancing exercise between the right at stake in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw furthermore they convincingly established the need for placing the protection of the defendant right to protection of reputation above the applicant freedom of expression in this context the court recall that it would require strong reason to substitute the court view for that of the domestic court see paragraph above such strong reason are lacking in the present case lastly the court observes that the applicant wa ordered to pay damage of eur see paragraph above and take note of the fact that the applicant ha not shown what his financial situation wa at the time and whether or not he struggled to pay that amount furthermore it ha not been argued let alone shown that the amount the applicant wa obliged to pay had a disproportionate impact on his financial situation in fact the applicant did not in any manner rely on the severity of the sanction but rather contested the measure itself see paragraph above the court is therefore satisfied that in the particular circumstance of the present case the imposed sanction can not be found to have been disproportionately severe see mutatis mutandis dorota kania v poland no no october and genner v austria no january and can not be considered to have been capable of having a chilling dissuasive effect on the applicant exercise of his right to freedom of expression having regard to all the foregoing factor and the margin of appreciation afforded to the state in this area the court concludes that the domestic court struck a fair balance between the applicant freedom of expression under article and miis right to have his reputation respected under article and that this assessment wa made in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court declares unanimously the application admissible hold by five vote to two that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on january pursuant to rule and of the rule of court marialena tsirli ganna yudkivska registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the separate opinion of judge de gaetano and vehabović is annexed to this judgment gymtjoint dissenting opinion of judge de gaetano and vehabović we regret that we can not share the view of the majority in this case that that there ha been no violation of article of the convention in the instant case the applicant criticism wa directed at mii a candidate in parliamentary election for a national political party mii wa thus to all intent and purpose a politician in respect of whom the limit of acceptable criticism are wider than in the case of a private individual see lingens v austria july series a no and satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june by standing in the parliamentary election mii entered the political arena and inevitably and knowingly laid himself open to close scrutiny scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalist and the public at large for these reason he wa required to display a greater degree of tolerance see among the most recent authority genner v austria no january the applicant wa punished for his statement in particular his utterance of the idea that mii wa an impostor a person who wa ready to accept any compromise and betray his elector for financial advantage according to the cluj napoca court of first instance those statement had harmed miis reputation and dignity and should not have been made public via the medium especially because they referred to private matter see paragraph of the judgment furthermore the court took into consideration the harmful effect that the distribution by third party of electoral leaflet reproducing the content of the applicant article had had on miis reputation see paragraph however and this is crucial for our dissent the domestic court failed in our view to undertake a balancing exercise between m ii reputation and the applicant freedom of expression in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw they also attached no particular relevance to the overall context of the text the general aim of the applicant article wa to draw voter attention to the question of miis suitability to be a candidate for national public office the statement in the article therefore concerned a matter of public interest for the local community even if some of them might appear harsh or farfetched a a general rule the court considers that opinion and information pertinent to election which are disseminated during an electoral campaign should be considered a forming part of a debate on question of public interest unless proof to the contrary is offered according to the court caselaw in respect of matter of public interest restriction on freedom of expression should be interpreted narrowly see by way of example kość v poland no june furthermore we are of the view that the domestic court did not clearly ass whether the contested statement were value judgment and if they were whether there wa a sufficient factual basis for them see for example morice v france gc no echr while it is true that some of the applicant statement such a those concerning miis alleged imposture and propensity to make immoral compromise could be considered statement which lacked a sufficient factual basis the thrust of the applicant article wa to cast doubt on the suitability of a local politician for public office admittedly the applicant article and in particular the expression used could be considered a polemical involving at least a certain degree of exaggeration the court however ha stated that person taking part in a public debate on a matter of general concern are allowed to have recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation or in other word to make somewhat immoderate statement see mutatis mutandis do carmo de portugal e castro câmara v portugal no october and the instant case is about exactly that we are of the view that the said expression do not amount to a gratuitous personal attack because the author supported them with an objective explanation namely the existence at the time of the article of an actual commercial dispute before the arbitration tribunal concerning miis alleged refusal to repay a loan see paragraph of the judgment moreover the court ha also held that in the field of political debate political invective often spill over into the personal sphere such are the hazard of politics and the free debate of idea which are the guarantee of a democratic society see among the most recent authority lykin v ukraine no january in the light of all this and in the absence of any pertinent reasoning provided by the domestic court in line with the court caselaw we can not consider that the applicant acted in bad faith the applicant wa moreover ordered to pay damage to the tune of eur see paragraph of the judgment the court ha repeatedly noted the chilling effect that a fear of sanction ha on the exercise of freedom of expression although the applicant ha not shown what his financial situation wa at the time and whether or not he struggled to pay that amount we are of the view that in the circumstance the sanction imposed wa capable of having a chilling dissuasive effect on the applicant exercise of his right to freedom of expression see for instance lombardo and others v malta no april and ghiulfer predescu v romania no june to sum up we are of the view that the domestic court failed to strike a fair balance between the relevant interest and to establish a pressing social need for putting the protection of miis reputation protected by article of the convention above the applicant right to freedom of expression under article of the convention and this in the context of political repartee we therefore ineluctably conclude that the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression wa not necessary in a democratic society and that there ha accordingly been a violation of article of the convention,,,

under article and of the convention that her suffering at the hand of the police officer had amounted to illtreatment and that her allegation of illtreatment had not been effectively investigated by the national authority the court considers that these complaint should be examined from the standpoint of article of the convention which read a follows no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment the government contested those argument a admissibility the government asked the court to dismiss these complaint for failure to comply with the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedy under article of the convention in this regard they stated that the kars public prosecutor decision of august had been served on the applicant and that she should have lodged an objection against that decision the government submitted in the alternative that the applicant should have lodged her application with the court within six month of the date of the kars public prosecutor decision a regard the government objection that the applicant failed to exhaust the domestic remedy available to her the court observes that the applicant lodged an objection against the decision of august which wa dismissed by the ardahan assize court following an examination on the merit had the kars public prosecutor decision been officially served on the applicant or her lawyer at an earlier date a claimed by the government the assize court would have dismissed the applicant objection on procedural ground for noncompliance with the timelimits the court further note that the government failed to submit any information or document to show that the applicant had learned about the decision of august prior to december the date on which the applicant lawyer claimed to have become aware of the decision in question the court therefore dismisses the government objection under this head a to the government submission concerning the sixmonth rule the court reiterates that in turkey an appeal against decision of public prosecutor not to prosecute constitutes in principle an effective and accessible domestic remedy within the meaning of article of the convention see epözdemir v turkey dec no january saraç v turkey dec no september hıdır durmaz v turkey no december pad and others v turkey dec no june nurettin aldemir and others v turkey no and december and i̇nan and others v turkey no and october in this connection the court observes that the applicant availed herself of this remedy by lodging an appeal against the kars public prosecutor decision thus the final decision regarding the applicant allegation under article of the convention is the decision of the ardahan assize court dated december the court further note that according to the applicant submission the decision of the ardahan assize court wa never served on her or her lawyer she claimed that her lawyer had found out about the content of this decision when he consulted the investigation file on january the government on the other hand did not seek to challenge the veracity of the submission of the applicant nor did they submit to the court any explanation or document demonstrating that the decision in question had been served on the applicant or her lawyer having regard to the government failure to challenge and refute the applicant claim and given that the applicant lodged her application with the court on july that is to say within six month of january the court concludes that with regard to her complaint under article the applicant complied with the sixmonth rule the court therefore reject the government submission that the applicant should have introduced her allegation of illtreatment to the court within six month of the date of the kars public prosecutor decision the court note that this part of the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the responsibility of the respondent state in the light of the substantive aspect of article of the convention the applicant submitted that she had been subjected to physical and psychological violence both during her arrest and when she wa detained in police custody in particular she and her friend had been beaten by thirty police officer and threatened and sexually abused by the arresting officer the government argued that the police had been obliged to use force a the applicant and her friend had resisted arrest and that the force employed had not been excessive they further noted that the content of the medical report of am and pm issued on october had been exactly the same demonstrating that the applicant had not been subjected to illtreatment while in police custody the court observes at the outset that it is not disputed between the party that the applicant sustained the injury noted in the medical report issued at am on october during her arrest effected on the same day in this connection the court reiterates that article doe not prohibit the use of force for effecting an arrest however such force may be used only if indispensable and must not be excessive ivan vasilev v bulgaria no april and the case cited therein the court is faced with two conflicting version a to how the applicant sustained these injury the applicant alleged that she had been beaten subjected to sexual assault threatened and insulted by the police whereas the government claimed that the applicant had resisted arrest and sustained injury a a result of her own conduct the court note in this connection that according to the medical report issued after the arrest of the applicant and her friend the arrestees a well a one of the arresting police officer were injured the doctor who examined the applicant and the police officer considered that the injury sustained by both of them had no lasting consequence see paragraph and above the court considers that the treatment described by the applicant would have left more serious mark on her body see tüzün v turkey no november besides given that the applicant wa held in police custody only for a few hour she could have sought to obtain a further medical report in support of her allegation after her release from custody on the other hand the court observes that the applicant raised allegation of battery sexual assault and threat both before the national authority and the court and that the medical report submitted to the court lack detail and fall short of both the standard recommended by the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cpt and the guideline set out in the istanbul protocol which are regularly taken into account by the court in it examination of case concerning illtreatment see inter alia akkoç v turkey no and echr x and the guideline set out in the istanbul protocol see batı and others v turkey no and echr iv extract a such the court considers that the medical report in question can not be relied on a evidence for proving or disproving the applicant allegation of illtreatment see mehmet eren v turkey no october gülbahar and others v turkey no october and ballıktaş v turkey no october having regard to the above and in the absence of any other proof the court considers that there is no evidence to corroborate or refute the applicant allegation that she wa illtreated by the police during her arrest and detention hence the court can not conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the injury sustained by the applicant were the result of illtreatment or of the use of disproportionate force by the police or that she wa sexually assaulted or threatened a alleged there ha therefore been no violation of article of the convention under it substantive limb the responsibility of the respondent state in the light of the procedural aspect of article of the convention the applicant complained that her allegation of illtreatment had not been effectively investigated by the national authority the government contested the applicant submission submitting that an investigation had promptly been initiated into the applicant allegation of illtreatment with a view to establishing whether the applicant had been illtreated and identifying and punishing those responsible had there been illtreatment the court reiterates that article of the convention requires the authority to investigate allegation of illtreatment when they are arguable and raise a reasonable suspicion see in particular ay v turkey no march in the present case the court ha not found it proved on account of a lack of evidence that the applicant wa illtreated nevertheless a it ha held in previous case that doe not preclude her complaint in relation to article from being arguable for the purpose of the obligation to investigate see among many other authority yaşa v turkey september report of judgment and decision vi ay cited above gülbahar and others cited above böke and kandemir v turkey no and march gök and güler v turkey no july and aysu v turkey no march the court considers that the injury sustained by the applicant and the applicant complaint submitted to the competent domestic authority created a reasonable suspicion that at least those physical injury might have been caused by an excessive use of force or illtreatment a such her complaint constituted an arguable claim in respect of which the national authority were under an obligation to conduct an effective investigation in this connection the court note that the kars public prosecutor initiated an investigation against two police officer vg and hö following a request for an investigation into their allegation of illtreatment lodged by the applicant and her friend see paragraph and above the court however considers that the applicant allegation were not effectively investigated by the domestic authority for the following reason firstly the kars public prosecutor failed to take statement from the suspected police officer in particular the officer who had arrived at the scene of the incident in order to support vg and hö were not at all heard by the public prosecutor besides vg and hö were not questioned a suspect in the investigation but made statement to the public prosecutor in their capacity a the complainant in the other investigation brought against the applicant and her friend see paragraph above secondly a the court ha noted above the medical report issued in respect of the applicant lack detail and fall short of both the standard recommended by the cpt and the guideline set out in the istanbul protocol in particular only the physical injury on the applicant body were noted in the medical report of october the doctor who examined the applicant neither noted her account of event in the section entitled information regarding the incident and the complaint of the person examined in the report nor carried out any psychiatric examination and completed the section entitled psychiatric examination the court considers that had the applicant failed to state any of the complaint that she subsequently raised before the national authority and the court the medical practitioner should have noted that she did not make any comment relevant to these section they also failed to include their observation concerning the cause of the applicant injury in the court view the kars public prosecutor should have questioned the quality of those report before basing his decision on them or requested a further medical examination what is more the kars public prosecutor took no step on his own initiative to identify possible witness in the court view given that the event in question occurred in a residential area in kars and that the applicant were distributing leaflet to the resident of that area the public prosecutor could have taken statement from those who lived in the neighbourhood in question in sum the court concludes that the applicant allegation of illtreatment were not subject to an adequate and effective investigation a required by article of the convention there ha accordingly been a violation of article of the convention under it procedural limb ii alleged violation of article of the convention relying on article of the convention the applicant complained that she had been prevented by force from exercising her right to freedom of expression the court note that regarding the applicant allegation under this head the government were asked to respond to a question put under both article and of the convention however given that the applicant did not claim to be a member of tayad and stated that she had distributed the leaflet a they reflected her opinion the court considers that this part of the application should be examined from the standpoint of article of the convention alone article of the convention read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested the applicant argument a admissibility the court note that this part of the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission the applicant complained that the police intervention while she wa distributing leaflet reflecting her opinion had constituted a breach of her right to freedom of expression the government replied that the police had approached the applicant and her friend in order to learn about the content of the leaflet and check their identity a they had resisted the security officer had had to arrest them according to the government neither the applicant arrest nor the case brought against her wa on account of the distribution of leaflet they therefore concluded that there had not been a violation of article the court assessmenta whether there wa interference the court note at the outset that it is disputed between the party whether there wa an interference with the applicant freedom of expression the applicant alleged that the police intervention in the distribution of the leaflet had constituted an interference with her right to freedom of expression whereas according to the government the applicant and her friend were arrested a they failed to comply with the police officer request to show them the content of the leaflet and their identity card the government noted that the applicant had not been put on trial on account of the content of the leaflet the court reiterates that it ha previously held that the arrest and detention of protester may constitute an interference with the right to freedom of expression see chorherr v austria august series a no b lucas v the united kingdom dec no march and açık and others v turkey no january the court further recall that in it judgment in the case of fatma akaltun fırat v turkey no and september it held that the police intervention in the distribution of leaflet published by a trade union and the detention of the applicant who wa a member of the trade union in question had prevented her from imparting information published by her trade union and thus constituted an interference with her right under article of the convention in the present case the court observes that although the applicant wa not the author of the leaflet in question she participated in their dissemination by distributing them and thereby exercised her right to impart information and opinion see andrushko v russia no october regarding the question a to whether the police intervention constituted an interference with the applicant right under article the court see no reason to depart from it consideration in the aforementioned judgment and decision whatever the reason given for the intervention of the police and the applicant arrest both measure prevented her from expressing her opinion and disseminating information and therefore constituted interference with her right guaranteed under article of the convention in the court view the absence of criminal proceeding against the applicant on account of the content of the leaflet doe not alter the fact that there wa an interference with her right to freedom of expressionb whether the interference wa justified the court reiterates that any interference will constitute a breach of article of the convention unless it is prescribed by law pursues one or more legitimate aim under paragraph of that provision and is necessary in a democratic society for the achievement of those aim see among many other authority ahmet yıldırım v turkey no echr the court further reiterates that the expression prescribed by law within the meaning of article requires firstly that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law however it also refers to the quality of the law in question requiring that it should be accessible to the person concerned who must moreover be able to foresee it consequence and that it should be compatible with the rule of law see among many other authority dink v turkey no and september according to the court established caselaw a rule is foreseeable if it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable any individual if need be with appropriate advice to regulate his conduct see among many other authority ahmet yıldırım v turkey cited above turning to the circumstance of the case the court note that the government contended that the police officer had intended to obtain information regarding the content of the leaflet when they approached the applicant and her friend having regard to section and of law no and section e of regulation no in force at the material time authorising the police to search individual and to require them to present their identity document in order to prevent commission of crime or to apprehend perpetrator of crime subject to certain condition see paragraph and above and in the absence of a finding of unlawfulness of the police intervention and the applicant subsequent arrest in the domestic proceeding see paragraph and above the court is prepared to accept that the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression wa prescribed by law the court is further of the opinion that the national authority may be considered to have pursued the legitimate aim of preventing disorder or crime in the present case what is in issue is whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society the court reiterates that in carrying out it scrutiny of the impugned interference the court must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see morice v france gc no april in the present case it is clear from the document in the case file that a soon a the police received information according to which tayad member were distributing leaflet in a residential area a number of police officer arrived at the scene of incident the subsequent sequence of event wa disputed between the arrestees including the applicant and the police officer before the judicial authority in their decision the kars criminal court the kars public prosecutor and the ardahan assize court considered the police officer version of the fact to be accurate and held that the applicant and her friend had resisted and insulted the police officer had refused to show their identity card and the leaflet and had injured a police officer by way of hitting him with their bag see paragraph and above at the end of the criminal proceeding brought against the applicant the kars criminal court convicted the applicant of obstructing the police officer in the execution of their duty and insulting them the court note that the police have a general obligation to protect public order and to prevent crime and are also authorised to carry out identity check pursuant to the domestic legislation see paragraph and above in this connection the court observes that the judicial authority in particular the kars criminal court considered that the applicant and her friend had been required to present their identity card and the leaflet to the police when asked and their failure to do so had led to a legitimate intervention by the security force the court reiterates that the domestic authority are better placed to examine and interpret the fact see florian goldstein and sc ring press srl v romania dec no april and to apply the national legislation given that the judicial authority in the present case provided an acceptable assessment of the fact the court doe not see any reason to depart from their finding thus it find that by not having complied with the lawful instruction of the police officer and having resisted the security force the applicant and her friend were themselves responsible for their arrest in other word the applicant wa not arrested for having distributed leaflet or because of the content of the leaflet distributed but she wa arrested a a consequence of her behaviour towards the police officer a a result the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression should be regarded a an incidental effect of the police operation and thus a a measure proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued in sum the court find that both the ground for the police intervention noted in the arrest report of october and the content of the decision of the judicial authority which had the opportunity to review the act and decision of the security force provided relevant and sufficient reason to justify the interference with the applicant freedom of expression the interference in question wa therefore necessary in a democratic society there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention iii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that she had been deprived of her liberty unlawfully and in breach of article of the convention she further complained under article of the convention that she had not been informed of the reason for her arrest the government contested those argument the court reiterates that according to it established caselaw where no remedy are available or if they are judged to be ineffective the sixmonth timelimit in principle run from the date of the act alleged to constitute a violation of the convention however where it concern a continuing situation the period of six month run from the end of the situation concerned see ege v turkey dec no february and narin v turkey no december in this connection the court observes that the applicant did not submit these claim to the national authority in particular in their submission to the kars public prosecutor of november and those to the kars assize court the applicant and her lawyer complained about the alleged illtreatment of the applicant and the alleged infringement of her right to freedom of expression they did not make any submission a to the alleged unlawfulness of the applicant detention nor did the applicant lodge an action for compensation for the alleged unlawfulness pursuant to article of the code on criminal procedure in the circumstance of the case the court is led to conclude that the applicant passivity in bringing her complaint under article to the attention of the domestic authority wa due to her consideration that these domestic remedy were ineffective in these circumstance and in the light of the aforementioned caselaw the court considers that the applicant should have lodged these complaint within six month following the end of her detention in police custody a the applicant detention ended on october and the application wa lodged on july the court find that these complaint were introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with article and of the convention iv application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court find that there ha been a violation of the convention or the protocol thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party the applicant did not submit a claim for just satisfaction accordingly the court considers that there is no call to award her any sum on that account for these reason the court declares unanimously the complaint under article and of the convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible hold unanimously that there ha been no violation of article of the convention under it substantive aspect hold unanimously that there ha been a violation of article of the convention under it procedural aspect hold by four vote to three that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on october pursuant to rule and of the rule of court stanley naismith andrás sajóregistrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the following separate opinion are annexed to this judgmenta concurring opinion of judge kjølbrob partly dissenting opinion of judge sajo keller and kuris asshnconcurring opinion of judge kjølbro i do not share the view expressed in paragraph and of the judgment in which the court is criticizing the medical report issued in respect of the applicant medical report are very important in case concerning alleged illtreatment in violation of article of the convention medical examination of person held in police custody serf a a guarantee against illtreatment and an effective mean to secure evidence and thereby secure accountability for illtreatment it is also important that medical examination are performed by independent doctor and that the examination is thorough and in conformity with good practice for doctor in this context the standard recommended by the cpt and the guideline set out in the istanbul protocol a also recognized in the court caselaw are very important see the case cited in paragraph and of the judgment however it doe not follow from this that any medical examination that doe not fully meet all the standard recommended by the cpt and the istanbul protocol may be criticized by the court in case concerning an alleged violation of article of the convention in other word the fact that a medical report doe not mentioning explanation given by the patient a to how the injury occurred and the opinion of the doctor a to whether the injury are consistent with those explanation akkoç v turkey no and echr x doe not in itself justify criticizing the medical report in my view it must depend on the specific circumstance of the case whether the medical report can be criticized by the court either in the context of assessing whether the illtreatment ha been proven beyond reasonable doubt the substantive limb of article or in the context of an assessment of the effectiveness of the investigation performed at domestic level the procedural limb of article on october shortly after am the applicant wa arrested by police officer le than minute later at am the applicant wa examined by a doctor who described injury observed paragraph of the judgment the section in the medical report entitled condition of examination information regarding the incident the complaint of the person examined and finding of the psychiatric examination were not completed paragraph of the judgment there is no information in the case to suggest that the applicant made any kind of complaint about illtreatment when she wa examined by the doctor nor ha the applicant in her complaint to the court alleged that she informed the doctor about the alleged illtreatment during her arrest furthermore when the applicant wa questioned by the police at pm that is approximately ½ hour after the arrest she refused to make statement to the police paragraph of the judgment it wa not until november more than a month after the arrest when the applicant wa questioned by the public prosecutor a a suspect that she described the illtreatment and asked the public prosecutor to prosecute the police officer responsible see paragraph of the judgment under those circumstance i do not find any basis for criticizing the medical report issued in my view it amount to an excessive burden to require medical examination to include without exception explanation given by the patient a to how the injury occurred and the opinion of the doctor a to whether the injury are consistent with those explanation this must in my view depend on the specific circumstance of the case including explanation given by or allegation made by the person arrested or the circumstance of the arrest therefore i respectfully distance myself from the criticism expressed by the court in paragraph and of the judgment but apart from that i fully agree with the judgment of the court joint partly dissenting opinion of judge sajó keller and kūris to our regret we can not follow the majority in it finding that there ha been no violation of article of the convention in the present case the government provided the following version of the fact the police received information according to which tayad member were distributing leaflet one of the officer approached the applicant and her friend told them that he wa a police officer and requested to see the content of the leaflet and their identity card a the applicant and her friend refused to comply and began using offensive language and hitting him a second police officer intervened this version of the fact is contradicted by the applicant the applicant wa convicted of obstructing the police officer in the execution of their duty and insulting them the court found that the allegation of illtreatment had not been effectively investigated by the national authority for this reason alone it is already questionable whether the intervention in the distribution wa lawful but our disagreement raise a more fundamental issue we agree with the majority the interference with the applicant article right consists in the intervention of the police in the distribution and the applicant arrest nevertheless the majority is of the view that the applicant wa punished for not showing her identity card and resisting the police order this matter is however immaterial with regard to the police interference with the distribution of the leaflet a the reason for the arrest remain contested we will consider the first interference the fact that the police acting upon information received went to inquire about the distribution of the leaflet and asked for the identity card of those distributing the leaflet in the absence of any information in the case file or detailed submission by the respondent government demonstrating the legal basis for the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression we have serious doubt a to whether the police intervention and the applicant arrest were based on any statutory provision we start from the assumption that this case originated in a targeted police action against the distribution of the leaflet see paragraph of the judgment it is of decisive importance that the police found it to be a matter of police concern that tayad member were distributing leaflet although neither the organisation on whose behalf the leaflet were distributed nor the leaflet themselves were illegal this court ha already dealt with action by the turkish authority directed against tayad member distributing leaflet and ha found such interference to be in violation of article of the convention see kara v turkey no september for police action at a demonstration involving tayad which resulted in a violation of article under both it procedural and it substantive aspect a well a a violation of article see özalp ulusoy v turkey no june true in many legal system there is a requirement to show identity card at the request of the police and the police are entitled to ask for such identification in situation determined by the law it go without saying that these provision must be applied in a reasonable manner if the police could disperse any demonstration by mean of systematic identity check of the demonstrator this would amount to the end of freedom of expression in public space the majority following the government argument considered the interest in public order and the prevention of crime to constitute sufficient ground for the police intervention this approach is in our view too broad because it give the police carte blanche when it come to identity check we start from the selfevident maxim that under the rule of law the police are also required to respect fundamental human right including freedom of expression according to the caselaw of this court interference with the exercise of a fundamental human right in the abstract name of public order without consideration of the necessity of such interference in a democratic society amount to a violation of article of the convention we are concerned that in the present case this standard requirement of the court caselaw wa put aside having regard to the lesson of history we are particularly concerned about the chilling effect of similar police practice state authority may compile list of people participating in demonstration andor distributing leaflet or other material which are officially not considered prohibited and use this personal information in different context against these people or those allegedly associated with them thus it is understandable that people exercising their freedom of expression by distributing leaflet especially where these criticise the government are afraid of disclosing their identity the above is a fundamental consideration for the effective protection of freedom of expression especially in the given circumstance see kara cited above it is unfortunate that the crucial restriction which the targeted police action entailed wa obfuscated by legal formality and the alleged disobedience of police order a situation that emerged because of the disregard by the police of the applicant freedom to distribute leaflet the only reason why the police requested the identity card of the applicant and her friend wa the fact that the leaflet were being distributed by person whom the police suspected to be tayad member or supporter in our opinion this seemingly minor incident disguised a the neutral application of a neutral law in a simple situation deserves the utmost attention by the court because the exercise of a fundamental freedom can not exist without the authority showing the necessary respect and tolerance compare and contrast éva molnár v hungary no october the court must always be vigilant in ensuring that state not only safeguard the right to distribute leaflet a a manifestation of the freedom of expression protected by article of the convention but also refrain from imposing unreasonable indirect restriction on that right the essential aim of article and article of the convention is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authority with the exercise of the right protected see mutatis mutandis oya

statement and explained that he had been contacted by the applicant who had asked him to prescribe fenemal for a a the applicant could not prescribe any medication himself because his doctor licence to practise had been withdrawn a confirmed that he had been in contact with the applicant who had helped him obtain the required medication since his attempted suicide a had received medication for his physical pain and his anxiety and his condition had therefore improved in respect of count the applicant wa convicted of assisted suicide committed in the spring of having prior to b death dispensed a dose of fenemal to him knowing full well that it wa intended for his suicide b had become paralysed in most of his body following a stroke he no longer found life worth living and wanted to die the applicant stated that he had visited b and advised him how to commit suicide in accordance with the guide that he had uploaded to the internet subsequently he had discussed with another person whether it wa possible to procure pill for b but he did not know whether that person had ever supplied the pill the applicant had not himself provided any medication for b according to the statement given by b former wife b had tried to be allowed to go to switzerland for euthanasia however no psychiatrist would issue a medical certificate saying that b wa mentally prepared a required by the swiss authority b former wife had then contacted the applicant asking him to help b they had met with the applicant who had indicated that he could establish contact with someone who could procure the medication subsequently b former wife had received a supply for b which she handed over to b who had later stated that he now had what he needed in may the family had had a farewell dinner with b and the next day b former wife had received a telephone call from the nursing home and been told that b wa fast asleep and that it wa not possible to waken him up b had passed away a couple of day later in respect of count the applicant wa convicted of assisted suicide committed between july and august c wa year old she suffered from many infirmity but wa not seriously ill she wished to end her life and had procured the necessary pill herself on july she had contacted the applicant by email and asked for his assistance the applicant and c had exchanged at least nine email between july and august on july the applicant had asked c which medication she had procured on july the applicant had confirmed that the medication at her disposal were excellent and also recommended that she look at the general guide on how to commit suicide which wa available on the website of the network on july he wa helping her finding the general guide on august he confirmed that it wa a good idea to combine the medication with a plastic bag over her head in which connection he had written if you are able to go through with it you will be certain remember in that case that it is necessary to put a rubber band around the neck on august c had been found dead in her bed with a plastic bag over her head in it judgment of september the supreme court stated liability for assisted suicide or attempt at assisted suicide by the high court judgment the applicant wa found guilty on two count of violation of section of the penal code for assisted suicide and one count of an attempt at assisted suicide this case concern whether according to the finding of fact of the high court the act performed by the applicant a described in the three count are punishable because they are considered assistance a set out in the provision and whether the condition for imposing a sentence for the attempt have been met in that case there is also the issue of the length of the sentence it is a punishable offence under section of the penal code to assist another person in ending his or her life but it is not a punishable offence to attempt to take one own life accordingly this provision independently criminalises assisted suicide the supreme court find that it will be determined based on an interpretation of this provision what kind of assistance fall within the scope of the liability for which reason it is not possible simply to use a a basis those kind of complicity that are punishable under the general rule of law set out in section of the penal code a complicity in offence minor assistance may fall outside the scope of criminal offence under section a regard count the applicant ha been found guilty of violation of section of the penal code because he procured medication for b prior to b death on may knowing full well that the medication were intended for his suicide a regard count the applicant ha been found guilty of attempted violation of section because he procured medication for a knowing full well that the medication were intended for a suicide which suicide failed however the supreme court concurs in the finding that the applicant act a described in count and count are punishable a assisted suicide a set out in section of the penal code a regard count the supreme court concurs in the finding that the condition for sentencing someone for an attempt have been met a the maximum penalty under section of a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three year make it possible to sanction attempt see section of the penal code the applicant submission concerning the legislative history of section can not lead to a different conclusion a regard count the applicant ha been found guilty of having in email exchanged with c advised her about suicide method including by confirming the choice of medication and by confirming that it wa a good idea to combine them with a plastic bag and by writing if you are able to go through with it you will be certain remember in that case that it is necessary to put a rubber band around the neck thereby he assisted her in committing suicide by taking medicine and putting a plastic bag over her head and closing it with a rubber band opinion of three judge concerning count we concur in the finding that by giving advice in his email exchange with c the applicant assisted her in a specific and significant way in committing suicide and that the advice is not exempt from punishment due to the circumstance that his advice wa based on a general guide that had lawfully been uploaded to the website of physician in favour of euthanasia in this context we have also taken into account that the specific advice offered by the applicant to c wa suited to a greater extent than the general guide to intensifying her desire to commit suicide in our opinion there is no basis for finding that it would be contrary to article of the european convention on human right to convict the defendant on this count opinion of two judge concerning count it appears from the case file that c contacted the applicant in july and indicated in her email that she wa year old and suffered from many infirmity that she wished to end soon and that thing had been clarified with her close family she had procured the necessary pill and her intention wa also to combine them with a plastic bag she wa very frightened of the potential risk that she would fail and she wa nervous a to whether she would be able to go through with it on her own the applicant then passed on information from the lawful guide on the website but he did not pas on any information not already available from the website he neither advocated nor encouraged her to commit suicide in these circumstance we find that the information given by the applicant to c wa not of such a nature that the information can independently be considered to constitute a punishable act of assistance in her ending her life accordingly we find that the applicant must be acquitted on this count of violation of section of the penal code which must also be considered to accord best with article of the european convention on human right on the right to receive and give information see in this respect the judgment delivered on october by the european court of human right in case and open door and dublin well woman v ireland the supreme court by a majority of three judge sentenced the applicant to day imprisonment suspended it wa taken into account a an aggravating circumstance that to a certain extent the act were committed in a systematic manner and that the applicant had been charged on three count the last act being committed after he had been provisionally charged by the police for violation of section of the penal code it wa considered a mitigating circumstance that the applicant wa almost year old the minority of two judge found that the applicant should have a suspended sentence of imprisonment for a term of day since count wa merely an attempt and under count he had not assisted to a significant extent moreover the minority of the judge found that the act had not been committed in a systematic manner relevant legal framework and practice the relevant provision of the penal code straffeloven read a follows section act aimed at inciting or assisting the commission of an offence are punishable a attempt if the offence is not completed the penalty prescribed for an offence may be reduced for attempt especially where an attempt reflects little strength or persistence of criminal intent unless otherwise provided attempt will only be punished if the offence is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding four month section the penalty provided for an offence applies to everybody who is complicit in the act by incitement aiding or abetting the punishment may be reduced where a person intended only to provide minor assistance or support an intent already formed and where the offence ha not been completed or intentional complicity failed the punishment may also be reduced where a person is complicit in the breach of a special duty to which he is not subject unless otherwise provided the punishment for complicity in offence that do not carry a sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding four month may be remitted where the accomplice intended only to provide minor assistance or support an intent already formed and where his complicity wa due to negligence section any person who kill another at such other person explicit request is sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three year section any person who assist someone in deliberately ending his life is sentenced to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three year assisted suicide ha been criminalised since section of the penal code wa given it current wording by act no of march in november the ministry of justice requested the standing committee on the criminal code straffelovrådet which is an advisory body tasked with making recommendation on legislative issue related to criminal law issue of principle relating to the stipulation of administrative criminal law provision and the implementation in practice of crime policy measure to consider the issue of whether to criminalise also general encouragement of suicide or suicide recipe not aimed at specific person in it report no the said committee did not recommend the criminalisation of general encouragement to suicide in respect of the scope of section of the penal code it stated a follows it is not a punishable offence to attempt to take one own life but it is a punishable offence under section of the penal code to assist another person in ending his or her life the maximum sentence is a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three year the offence is consummated when the victim dy depending on the circumstance it is possible to sentence a person for an attempt at assisting another person in ending his or her life see section read with section of the penal code attempt comprise any act aimed at inciting or assisting in the commission of an offence see pp ff of the annotated criminal code den kommenterede straffelov on general rule the question is whether section only applies to physical and mental assistance of a qualified nature or whether in accordance with the general danish law rule on complicity set out in section of the penal code the provision also applies if the offender by incitement aiding or abetting deliberately assist a particular person in committing suicide see pp ff on general rule and p on special rule of the annotated criminal code for an act to be punishable under section it is required in any circumstance that the offender must have performed a specific act of assistance with the intent that one or more specific person commit suicide encouragement of suicide and description of method to commit suicide do not fall within the scope of section if not directed at specific person therefore the presentation or dissemination of suicide recipe through internet website or the like can not normally be punished under section a mentioned above a person can be sentenced for assistance under section of the criminal code only if the purpose of the offence of assistance is a specific act of assistance the issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide ha regularly been the subject of public and political debate in denmark but so far there ha not been a political majority in parliament in favour of amending section of the penal code the issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide ha also been considered by the council of ethic det etiske råd the council of ethic is an independent body established in to advise parliament minister and public authority on ethical issue in health care while respecting the integrity and dignity of human and future generation in and the council of ethic published report and recommendation on euthanasia and assisted suicide a large majority of the seventeen member of the council wa against the legalisation of euthanasia and assisted suicide in all three report the council ha balanced the consideration on the one hand factor like the right to personal autonomy and on the other hand factor like the sanctity of human life a a fundamental ethical standard and the incompatibility of euthanasia with an ethically appropriate relationship between a physician and a patient the danish council of ethic discussed the subject again in on the basis of a judgment delivered by the german federal constitutional court in february which had ruled that the maintenance of a prohibition of assisted suicide wa unconstitutional in parliament amended the danish health care act sundhedsloven enhancing patient right to refuse treatment including lifesustaining treatment which mean that a patient who ha come to term with circumstance and doe not want any lifesustaining treatment can refuse the treatment offered even though the consequence of withdrawing from lifesustaining treatment is that the patient will die right away moreover a system of living will ha been set up under which individual can make binding advance decision to refuse lifesustaining treatment in specific situation that may occur some time in the future if they become permanently incompetent and are no longer able to exercise their right to personal autonomy prior to the adoption of the amendment bill it wa discussed at the reading in parliament what is a dignified death and what is the right to personal autonomy and it wa discussed that it must be ensured that health care professional can discontinue lifesustaining treatment without fearing being charged with homicide on request finally in december all party in parliament concluded a political agreement to roll out an it system that wa to support a future right of elderly feeble citizen to ask their physician to write a donotresuscitate order in the event that they suffer from heart failure it is expected that a bill granting this right will be introduced in relevant international and european material recommendation of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe recommended inter alia a follows paragraph that the committee of minister encourage the member state of the council of europe to respect and protect the dignity of terminally ill or dying person in all respectsc by upholding the prohibition against intentionally taking the life of terminally ill or dying person whilei recognising that the right to life especially with regard to a terminally ill or dying person is guaranteed by the member state in accordance with article of the european convention on human right which state that no one shall be deprived of his life intentionallyii recognising that a terminally ill or dying person wish to die never constitutes any legal claim to die at the hand of another personiii recognising that a terminally ill or dying person wish to die can not of itself constitute a legal justification to carry out action intended to bring about death comparative law in a comparative research in respect of fortytwo council of europe member state see koch v germany no july showed that in thirtysix country albania andorra austria azerbaijan bosnia and herzegovina bulgaria croatia cyprus the czech republic denmark estonia france georgia greece hungary ireland latvia lithuania the former yugoslav republic of macedonia malta moldova monaco montenegro norway poland portugal romania russia san marino spain serbia slovakia slovenia turkey ukraine and

practitioner were not entitled to prescribe a drug in order to facilitate suicide conversely only four member state switzerland belgium the netherlands and luxembourg allowed medical practitioner to prescribe lethal drug subject to specific safeguard the government have submitted the following information about the current legislation in member state including denmark norway sweden france the united kingdom turkey bulgaria iceland ireland portugal spain luxembourg belgium switzerland germany italy austria estonia the netherlands and finland euthanasia is allowed in a number of country under certain specified condition including spain the netherlands luxembourg and belgium in spain following the recent adoption of an act to this effect it is now possible for patient suffering from a

criterion have been met including that the patient endures unbearable suffering without any prospect of improvement that the patient ha been examined by at least one external physician and that the euthanasia is performed in accordance with the existing health care guideline in luxembourg and belgium euthanasia is also lawful under certain condition including that the patient health problem are incurable and the patient suffers from unbearable physicalmental pain that the patient must have had a number of consultation with his or her physician on the subject and that the physician must have consulted another physician a well a a close relative of the patient appointed by the patient in portugal euthanasia continues to be criminalised but in january the portuguese parliament adopted a bill intended to make euthanasia and physicianassisted suicide lawful for terminally ill and wounded person however the portuguese constitutional court quashed the bill because it found it too unspecific the ruling party ha now introduced a revised bill which take into account the criticism raised by the constitutional court if the bill is adopted by parliament the president may submit the bill to the constitutional court for review a part of the enactment process in a number of country euthanasia is criminalised whereas assisted suicide is lawful in certain circumstance those country are sweden switzerland germany italy austria estonia and finland assisted suicide is not criminalised in sweden but the swedish parliament recently adopted an amending act making it a punishable act in certain circumstance to encourage or otherwise exert influence on another person to take his or her own life in pursuance of this amending act any person who incites or otherwise exerts influence on another person to take his or her own life is punished for encouragement of suicide or negligent incitement to suicide this could be to introduce a suicidal person to a razor blade or to give detailed instruction to a person about a particular method of committing suicide for example by sending him or her a socalled suicide manual the exchange of general information on suicide issue ha not been criminalised in switzerland assisted suicide is lawful and is offered by various organisation however assisted suicide is punished by imprisonment or a pecuniary penalty if the person assisting in the suicide is motivated by selfserving end in germany assisted suicide ha been decriminalised a a consequence of a judgment of the federal constitutional court similarly assisted suicide ha been decriminalised in austria since december a a consequence of a decision made by the constitutional court of austria in italy both euthanasia and assisted suicide are criminalised however the case law of the italian constitutional court ha opened up for an exception in connection with lifesustaining treatment of an incurable disease under certain specified condition including if the person is kept alive by the treatment of vital function while suffering from an incurable disease that cause unbearable physical or mental pain and if a public national health authority ha granted an approval following consultation of the local committee on ethic both euthanasia and assisted suicide are criminalised in denmark norway france iceland bulgaria and turkey however in denmark and norway the distribution of general information on suicide method is not criminalised in france the sanction for all kind of propaganda for andor marketing of product or method that are recommended a mean to commit suicide is imprisonment for a term of three year and a fine in the amount of eur in the united kingdom a bill on assisted dying wa examined by the house of lord on october allowing adult diagnosed with a terminal illness under certain circumstance to submit an application for assisted dying to the high court general information on suicide for example on a website may lead to the imposition of a sentence in ireland both euthanasia and assisted suicide are criminalised but a bill ha been introduced in the lower house of the irish parliament to legalise voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide for terminally ill person the bill is currently being considered by the irish committee on legal affair which ha recommended that a specific committee be set up to draft the bill considering the serious nature of the subject the distribution of general information on suicide method is not criminalised in ireland the law the applicant complained that the supreme court judgment of september breached his right to freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the court note that the application is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merit party argument the applicant submitted inter alia that the case concerned on the one hand the general right to receive information on assisted suicide a matter in which the government previous wide margin of appreciation should now be decreased due the growing legalisation of assisted suicide in europe and the increasing shift in public opinion on this subject on the other hand the case concerned the applicant right to freedom of expression in essence the applicant had been convicted for orally providing individual with information which he could legally provide in writing to the general public in his guide on suicide he referred to the finding of the minority of the supreme court in respect of count such an interference with his right to freedom of expression which did not relate to the actual subject of the expression or information but rather to how and to whom it wa provided could not be considered proportionate the government pointed out inter alia that encouragement of suicide and description of method to commit suicide fell outside the scope of section of the penal code if it wa not directed at specific person however it wa punishable under the said provision if the offender performed a specific act of assistance with the intent that an individual commit suicide thus the guide to commit suicide prepared by the applicant wa legal whereas it wa illegal for him to provide specific advice to particular person on how they could commit suicide in addition under count and the supreme court had unanimously found that besides having given specific advice the applicant had also performed specific act by prescribing or procuring via others the medication necessary for the relevant person to commit suicide in the government view the court should take into account that the case concerned difficult ethical and moral issue on which there wa no consensus among the member state moreover the current state of the law expressed the legislature deliberate choice after regular review most recently in furthermore the national court had thoroughly reviewed the compatibility of the interference with the convention in accordance with the guideline given by the court in it caselaw for which reason state party should be allowed a wide margin of appreciation in determining whether assisted suicide should be allowed under national law ordo iuris institute for legal culture submitted observation on among other thing assisted suicide law in europe and international professional standard regarding physicianassisted suicide the court assessmenta applicable principle the general principle regarding the right to freedom of expression within the meaning of article of the convention are wellsettled in the court caselaw and summarised for example in perinçek v switzerland gc no and echr extract moreover it is established caselaw that the national authority enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in matter of moral particularly in an area such a the present which touch on matter of belief concerning the nature of human life see among others open door and dublin well woman v ireland october series a no a in addition the quality of the parliamentary and judicial review of the necessity of a general measure such a in the present case the criminalisation of assisted suicide is of particular importance including to the operation of the relevant margin of appreciation see among others animal defender international v the united kingdom gc no echr extract correia de matos v portugal gc no and april and ma v denmark gc no july a further factor which ha an impact on the scope of the margin of appreciation is the existence or not of common ground between the national law of the contracting state see among others parrillo v italy gc no echr and ma v denmark cited above finally the court fundamentally subsidiary role in the convention protection system ha an impact on the scope of the margin of appreciation the contracting party in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity have the primary responsibility to secure the right and freedom defined in the convention and the protocol thereto and in doing so they enjoy a margin of appreciation subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the court through their democratic legitimation the national authority are a the court ha held on many occasion in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local need and condition see inter alia lekić v slovenia gc no december see also protocol no which entered into force on august b application of these principle to the present casei prescribed by law and legitimate aim it is not in dispute between the party that the applicant conviction constituted an interference prescribed by law namely section of the penal code which pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of health and moral and the right of others the court note that regarding count and the applicant wa convicted not only for having provided guidance but also for having by specific act procured medication for the person concerned see paragraph and above the court therefore find reason to doubt whether in respect of these count there wa indeed an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression within the meaning of article nevertheless in the following it will proceed on the assumption that there wasii necessity in a democratic society assisted suicide ha been criminalised in the danish legislation since the current wording of section of the penal code is from for an act to be punishable under section it is required that the offender must have performed a specific act of assistance with the intent that one or more specific person commit suicide encouragement of suicide and description of method of committing suicide do not fall within the scope of section if not directed at specific person therefore the presentation or dissemination of suicide recipe through internet website or the like can not normally be punished under section see paragraph above in the present case the court is not required to determine whether the criminalisation of assisted suicide is justified under the court well established caselaw in proceeding originating in an individual application under article of the convention it task is not to review domestic law in abstracto instead it must determine whether the manner in which it wa applied to or affected the applicant gave rise to a violation of the convention it can thus only review whether or not the application of section of the penal code in the case of the applicant wa necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention see inter alia perinçek v switzerland cited above the answer to the question whether such a necessity exists depends on the need to protect the health and moral and the right of others in issue by way of criminal law measure turning first to it caselaw the court found in haas v switzerland no echr that article of the convention which creates for the authority a duty to protect vulnerable person even against action by which they endanger their own life also obliges the national authority to prevent an individual from taking his or her own life if the decision ha not been taken freely and with full understanding of what is involved in koch v germany no july and the reference cited therein the court acknowledged that an individual right to decide in which way and at which time his or her life should end provided that he or she wa in a position freely to form his or her own will and to act accordingly wa one of the aspect of the right to respect for private life within the meaning of article of the convention moreover in gross v switzerland no may the court considered that the applicant wish to be provided with a dose of sodium pentobarbital allowing her to end her life fell within the scope of her right to respect for her private life under article of the convention it will be recalled that the case wa referred to the grand chamber which on september declared it inadmissible for abuse of the right of application within the meaning of article a of the convention there is no support in the court caselaw however for concluding that a right to assisted suicide exists under the convention including in the form of providing information about or assistance that go beyond providing general information about suicide compare under article pretty v the united kingdom no echr iii accordingly a the applicant wa not prosecuted for providing general information about suicide including the guide on suicide that had been made publicly available but wa prosecuted for having assisted suicide through specific act the court find that the present case is not about the applicant right to provide information that others under the convention had a right to receive before the supreme court the applicant submitted that he had only assisted a b and c by providing guidance and information which wa already legally accessible on the internet and which failed to reach the threshold under section of the penal code he relied specifically on article of the convention a regard count and the supreme court found unanimously that the applicant had not only provided guidance but had also by specific act procured medication for the person concerned in the knowledge that it wa intended for their suicide such act were clearly covered by section of the penal code and implicitly did not give rise to an issue under article a regard count it wa found established that the applicant in email exchanged with c had advised her about suicide method including by confirming the choice of medication and by confirming that it wa a good idea to combine them with a plastic bag and by writing if you are able to go through with it you will be certain remember in that case that it is necessary to put a rubber band around the neck on the basis of an interpretation of section in the light notably of the preparatory work the legislative review including report no by the standing committee on the penal code see paragraph above and the convention the majority of the supreme court found the applicant guilty under the said provision in that he had assisted c in a specific and significant way in committing suicide that his advice wa not exempted from punishment because it wa based on his lawful general guide on the website of physician in favour of euthanasia that his specific advice wa suited to a greater extent than the general guide to intensifying c desire to commit suicide and that his conviction would not be in breach of article of the convention the applicant wa given a suspended sentence of day imprisonment it wa taken into account a an aggravating circumstance that to a certain extent the act had been committed in a systematic manner and that the applicant had been charged on three count the last act being committed after he had been provisionally charged by the police for violation of section of the penal code it wa considered a mitigating circumstance that the applicant wa almost year old the court see no reason to call into question the supreme court conclusion it note that a crucial question wa the distinction to be drawn between the legal general guide available on the internet and the specific information provided by the applicant to c the majority found that the specific information provided by the applicant wa based on the general guide see paragraph and above and it doe not appear that he added any information which did not follow from the general guide however the majority also found that the applicant specific advice wa suited to a greater extent than the general guide to intensifying c desire to commit suicide the court note in this respect that c in her first email of july to the applicant had asked for his assistance although she had already procured the necessary medication herself and wa aware of the existence of the general guide on the internet moreover the applicant and c exchanged at least nine email in the period from july to august thus during a period of approximately three week in these circumstance the court considers that the reason relied on by the supreme court when finding that the act fell within the scope of section of the penal code were relevant and sufficient the court also note that the supreme court made a thorough judicial review of the applicable law in the light of the convention including the court judgment in open door and dublin well woman v ireland cited above about a restriction of an absolute nature on the provision of information to pregnant woman concerning abortion facility abroad regardless of age or state of health or their reason for seeking counselling on the termination of pregnancy the interference concerned service which were lawful in other country and which could be crucial to a woman health and wellbeing ibid on that ground alone the court found that it appeared overbroad and disproportionate ibid in addition the counsellor neither advocated nor encouraged abortion but confined themselves to an explanation of available option in the present case it wa undisputed that the applicant could legally publish his guide medicine suited for suicide on the internet and could encourage to suicide if not directed at specific person the charge concerned the applicant concrete assistance or advice to three specific person a b and c on how to commit suicide the restriction in section of the penal code wa imposed in order to protect such person health and wellbeing by preventing other person from assisting in their suicide the case at hand thus differs significantly from open door and dublin well woman v ireland having regard to the above the court considers that the quality of the judicial review of the disputed general measure and it application in the present case militates in favour of a wide margin of appreciation the court note that a criminal conviction is a serious sanction having regard to the existence of other mean of intervention and rebuttal particularly through civil remedy see for example perinçek v switzerland cited above in the circumstance of the present case however the court doe not find the conviction and the sentence excessive bearing also in mind that the sentence wa suspended another element which speaks in favour of a wide margin of appreciation in the present case is the fact that the subject of assisted suicide concern matter of moral see paragraph above and that the comparative law research set out in paragraph to above enables the court to conclude that the member state of the council of europe are far from having reached a consensus on this issue see paragraph above see also for example haas v switzerland cited above in the light of all the abovementioned consideration the court considers that the reason relied upon by the domestic court and most recently the supreme court in it judgment of september were both relevant and sufficient to establish that the interference complained of can be regarded a necessary in a democratic society

50,the applicant wa born in and life in toruń the applicant is a publicist and a professor of sociology a the statement in issue on january rzeczpospolita a national daily newspaper published an article titled zybertowicz so far to the third polish republic zybertowicz na razie dla iii rp the article contained information about three civil lawsuit against the applicant instituted by am the editorinchief of one of the biggest daily newspaper gazeta wyborcza and a certain m and z the article also included a comment by the applicant on the lawsuit in question in a way it is quite interesting to note who ha lodged civil claim against me so far two agent and one their fierce defender swoją drogą to ciekawe kto mnie dotychczas pozwał do sądu dwóch agentów i jeden ich zaciekły obrońca b civil proceeding against the applicant on march am brought a civil action in the warsaw regional court sąd okręgowy requesting legal protection of his personal right he asked that the applicant be ordered to publish an apology and to pay damage of polish zloty pln approximately euro eur to a charity on april the warsaw regional court transferred the case to the toruń regional court on august the warsaw court of appeal sąd apelacyjny quashed this decision on june the warsaw regional court gave judgment and partly allowed the plaintiff claim it ordered the applicant to publish an apology on the first second or third page of rzeczpospolita it further determined the exact size and wording of the apology the court also ordered the applicant to pay pln approximately eur to a charity and pln approximately eur in court fee during the proceeding the court questioned the applicant and the plaintiff the applicant argued that the phrase in question had represented his opinion about am public statement referring to several published statement and excerpt from article written by am the applicant claimed that he had had a good factual basis for giving this opinion of am view about lustration the court also obtained an opinion from an expert on linguistics the expert wa asked in particular to reply to the question of whether the phrase two agent and one their fierce defender in the context of the case constituted a statement of fact or an opinion in his opinion of may the expert stated that the phrase in question had been a statement of fact and not a hypothesis or supposition in addition taking into account the reader presumed general knowledge it wa obvious that am had been identified in the article a having defended two agent the plaintiff submitted to the court a second expert report dated january in which another expert on language analysis confirmed that the applicant statement had been a statement of fact the warsaw regional court noted that the applicant when formulating the statement in question referred in particular to a number of published statement made by am in which he had criticised the lustration law the applicant also relied on an earlier warsaw court of appeal judgment confirming that z had indeed collaborated under communism with the security service the court further held that everyone including those not following the news carefully wa aware that m and z had been accused of collaborating with the security service in particular reader of rzeczpospolita should have been aware of that fact a the newspaper had published numerous article on the issue the warsaw regional court also held that judging by both the applicant statement and the whole article it did not appear that am had been an agent while the applicant in his statement had not specified who in his opinion had been an agent and who their fierce defender from the nature of the publication and taking into account the reader general knowledge it wa clear that it wa the plaintiff who wa considered to be the fierce defender of two agent at the same time the court accepted that had the applicant used a more general formulation and referred only to am attitude towards the lustration law such word could have fallen within the limit of acceptable criticism and it would not have been necessary to protect am personal right lastly the court considered that from the published statement and quote from am public statement which the applicant had submitted during the proceeding it did not appear that am had ever actually defended those two particular person in conclusion the court held that am personal right had been breached but only partially for this reason the court considered that the plaintiff claim had been exaggerated therefore it lowered the sum to be paid to the charity both party appealed on march the warsaw court of appeal modified the firstinstance judgment and ordered the applicant to pay pln approximately eur to the charity and pln approximately eur in court fee the applicant wa also ordered to publish an apology in rzeczpospolita the court in principle agreed with the reasoning presented by the regional court it held that while the phrase fierce defender of two agent had breached am personal right it wa not defamatory the court further agreed with the regional court that the applicant had named am a having defended two particular person however he had failed to prove that his statement had been true consequently the court considered that the phrase used by the applicant had breached the plaintiff personal right in particular his good name and had conflicted with the value espoused by him the court referred to the ongoing public debate in poland about the necessity of lustration in order to explain and disclose the role of various special service after the world war ii it noted that in the context of that debate the phrase that someone wa a fierce defender of agent suggested that that person had defended them justified their action and searched for a way to absolve them from any responsibility in the eye of the public consequently attributing to someone the role of fierce defender of agent wa a breach of that person good name and suggested that that person behaviour had been contrary to the public good the court also held that the phrase in question had been a statement of fact however it considered that there had been no basis for concluding that am had defended any agent or more generally defended activity of the communist secret service that had been harmful to the public on the contrary he had firmly condemned such activity he had objected to lustration being understood a a tool to destroy people and being used a an argument in political game with reference to the sum to be paid to the charity the court noted that the applicant wa a highly educated university professor holding numerous public office a person in the applicant situation should have been aware of how his statement would have been understood by an average reader of rzeczpospolita and whether there wa any basis for attributing to someone the role of fierce defender of agent the court further held that the sum of pln to be paid to charity wa symbolic and that pln wa a more appropriate sum given the circumstance of the case especially considering that it wa not an excessive burden for the applicant the applicant lodged a cassation appeal in particular he referred to article of the convention on march the supreme court sąd najwyższy refused to entertain the applicant cassation appeal on account of the lack of important legal issue to be considered in the case the court relying on article of the convention noted that freedom of expression did not have an absolute character it further referred to it own caselaw according to which the necessity to prove that a statement of fact wa true wa not an excessive requirement and did not infringe the freedom of political debate c enforcement proceeding on april am representative instituted enforcement proceeding in the warsaw district court aimed at compelling the applicant to comply with the obligation imposed by the warsaw court of appeal judgment of march on june the warsaw district court ordered the applicant to publish the apology ordered by the warsaw court of appeal in rzeczpospolita after the applicant failed to comply with that order on june the warsaw district court allowed am to publish the apology in rzeczpospolita in the applicant name and ordered him to cover the fee for it publication in the amount of pln approximately eur the applicant received a significant discount on that fee ii relevant domestic law and practice article of the civil code contains a nonexhaustive list of right known a personal right dobra osobiste this provision state the personal right of an individual such a health liberty reputation cześć freedom of conscience name or pseudonym image secrecy of correspondence inviolability of the home scientific or artistic work and invention and improvement shall be protected under civil law regardless of the degree of protection laid down in other legal provision article of the civil code provides for way of redressing infringement of personal right under that provision a person faced with the threat of an infringement may demand that the prospective perpetrator refrain from the wrongful activity in question unless it is not unlawful where an infringement ha taken place the person affected may inter alia request that the wrongdoer make an apology in an appropriate form or demand satisfaction from him or her if an infringement of personal right cause financial loss the person concerned may seek damage under article of the civil code a person whose

convention of a breach of his right to freedom of expression that article read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court note that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the applicant submission the applicant submitted that the entire statement had been made in the course of a public debate and in connection with the discussion on lustration in his opinion the domestic court had failed to make a distinction between factual statement and value judgment those of his statement that had allegedly infringed am right had been value judgment which had had a sufficient factual basis during the proceeding he had referred to numerous statement made by am and had insisted that his opinion had described am position towards lustration in poland despite that the court had relied on a very narrow reading of the phrase fierce defender of agent and had held that the impugned statement should have been understood a a factual statement in the applicant view this very formalistic approach on the part of the domestic court had effectively deprived him of the protection afforded by article of the convention the applicant referred to the fact that the warsaw regional court had confirmed that some of am statement might have constituted a sufficient basis for the applicant to use the expression fierce defender of agent nevertheless the court had refused to read the applicant statement in this way and had persisted with a narrow linguistic interpretation of the phrase taking all those element into account the applicant considered that his statement had not overstepped the limit of the protection afforded to him by article of the convention the government submission the government submitted that the statement in question had concerned legal case against the applicant and that therefore it had not formed part of an open discussion on matter of public concern since the applicant although a publicist had been acting a a private individual on this occasion they further considered that the domestic authority rightly qualified the applicant statement a a statement of fact rather than a a value judgment yet the applicant had failed to prove the veracity of his allegation they further noted that freedom of expression could not justify making public statement that were untrue and which infringed the personal right of others they concluded by saying that the domestic court had provided detailed reasoning for their decision furthermore the interference had not been disproportionate a the applicant had only been ordered to publish an apology and to pay pln to charity consequently the government invited the court to find no violation of article of the convention in the present case the court assessmenta the general principle the general principle for assessing whether an interference with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention are well settled in the court caselaw they were recently restated in pentikäinen v finland gc no echr and bédat v switzerland gc no march the court must also ascertain whether the domestic authority struck a fair balance taking into consideration the margin of appreciation afforded to the contracting state between the protection of freedom of expression a enshrined in article and the protection of the reputation of those against whom allegation were made a right which a an aspect of private life is protected by article of the convention in two fairly recent case the court defined it own role in balancing these two conflicting interest it went on to identify a number of relevant criterion where the right to freedom of expression is balanced against the right to respect for private life see axel springer ag v germany gc no february and von hannover v germany no gc no and echr b application of the above principle to the present case it wa not disputed that the court decision in the present case and the sanction imposed on the applicant amounted to an interference with his right to freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the convention such interference wa undoubtedly prescribed by law namely under article and of the civil code the court further accepts that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or right of others namely the good name reputation and credibility of am within the meaning of article of the convention accordingly the only outstanding issue is whether the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression wa necessary in a democratic society in the instant case the applicant when commenting for rzeczpospolita on civil lawsuit against him lodged by am stated that in a way it is quite interesting to note who ha lodged civil claim against me so far two agent and one their fierce defender the domestic court examined the veracity of this statement and concluded that there wa no basis for believing that am had defended any person who had collaborated with the communistera security service the court take note of the fact that the phrase in question constituted an attack on am good name on account of his alleged indulgence for abuse committed under the communist regime such an utterance wa capable of attaining a sufficient level of seriousness in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life the domestic authority were thus faced with the difficult task of balancing two conflicting value namely freedom of expression for the applicant on the one hand and am right to respect for his reputation on the other see axel springer ag gc cited above in such case one factor the court ha taken into account is the position of the person concerned by the publication whether or not he or she wa a public figure or had otherwise entered the public scene another important factor is whether the statement in question contributed to a debate of general interest see krone verlag gmb h v austria no june in the present case the court observes that am is a former dissident a leading polish intellectual and the editorinchief of one of the country biggest daily newspaper who is actively engaged in political life and debate on current issue the court ha already held that journalist and publicist like other person actively involved in public life should display a greater degree of tolerance for criticism against them see kurski v poland no july despite the government assertion see paragraph above the court considers that the statement at issue dealt with a matter of public concern namely the lustration of journalist such a matter could and in the present case did give rise to a public debate in this respect the court reiterates that there is little scope under article of the convention for restriction on freedom of expression when a matter of public interest is at stake see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no echr extract the court further observes that the domestic court correctly recognised the context in which the applicant allegation had been made they expressly referred to the ongoing public debate in poland about the necessity of lustration see paragraph above and even noted that had the applicant used a more general formulation his statement would have fallen within the limit of acceptable criticism see paragraph above with regard to the classification of the statement at issue the applicant argued before the domestic court that his statement had described am position towards lustration in poland see paragraph above the domestic court referring to expert opinion considered that the phrase in question had been a statement of fact see paragraph and above there is no reason to depart from this assessment even statement made in the context of a wider debate on an issue of public concern should have a solid factual basis on which to base that allegation see ärztekammer für wien and dorner v austria no february however the domestic court after carefully examining example of public statement made by am concluded that there had been no such factual basis while am had indeed been critical towards the lustration law he had never defended the two person named a agent by the applicant see paragraph and above the court doe not see a reason to find the domestic court conclusion unreasonable or arbitrary therefore the court considers that the reason given by the domestic court were relevant and sufficient finally a regard the proportionality of the sanction the court note that the applicant wa ordered to cover the cost of proceeding to pay pln approximately eur to a charity and to arrange for the publication of an apology the fee for which wa originally set at pln approximately eur but in respect of which the applicant benefitted from a substantial discount in an unknown amount the court further note that in deciding on the amount to be paid to charity the domestic court carefully weighed the possibility and determined the amount of the fine imposed on the applicant in the light of his financial situation see paragraph above it ha not been argued let alone shown that the amount the applicant wa obliged to pay had a disproportionate impact on him therefore the sanction imposed can not be found to have been disproportionate see mutatis mutandis genner v austria no january having regard to the above the court is satisfied that the authority struck a fair balance between the interest of the protection of the plaintiff reputation on the one hand and the applicant right to exercise his freedom of expression where issue of public interest are concerned on the other and that this assessment wa made in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the interference could thus be reasonably considered necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of paragraph of article of the convention there ha accordingly been no violation of that provision for these reason the court unanimously declares the application admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in

51,the applicant wa born in and life in warsaw a background to the case in the applicant who is a journalist published a book entitled gazeta wyborcza beginning and beyond gazeta wyborcza początki i okolice the book relates in an unfavourable light the story of the founding of gazeta wyborcza one of the best known polish daily newspaper with a nationwide distribution the newspaper wa founded in in the wake of the socalled round table talk between the communist government and the head of the then democratic opposition which ultimately led to the first semifree election in poland since and to the ultimate dismantling of the communist regime by the end of the second edition of the applicant book wa published in no review of the book were published in the press subsequently the applicant requested seven daily and weekly newspaper to publish an identical paid advertisement for the book the text of the proposed advertisement read a follows it doe not make for pleasant reading for the editorinchief of gazeta wyborcza friend the truth about gazeta wyborcza previously unseen document and new witness stanisław remuszko a former journalist at the newspaper today working freelance ha written the first ever book in poland europe and the world about gazeta wyborcza and it background do you have the faintest idea where the wealth of gazeta wyborcza come from information available at wwwremuszkopl all the newspaper nasz dziennik wprost metropol newsweek polityka and rzeczpospolita refused to publish the advertisement gazeta polska wa the first to agree to publish it and they signed a contract with the applicant however shortly afterwards the editor changed his mind refused publication and reimbursed the money paid by the applicant on june the applicant lodged seven identical claim with the warsaw regional court against the newspaper he requested that the court order the defendant newspaper to publish the advertisement the applicant referred to section of the press act see paragraph below arguing that nothing in the advertisement a proposed could reasonably be construed a being in breach of the law or third party personal right or contrary to the editorial policy of the defendant unless they considered that their editorial policy included a duty to protect the interest of gazeta wyborcza it editorinchief and publisher the applicant referred to article of the constitution and to section of the press act the warsaw regional court by judgment dated january may may january and march dismissed his action against nasz dziennik wprost metropol newsweek and polityka respectively the applicant appealed by judgment of december and june the warsaw court of appeal allowed his appeal and ordered the defendant newspaper wprost and metropol to publish the advertisement concerned no appeal wa lodged against those judgment during the appellate proceeding against nasz dziennik the warsaw court of appeal decided on october to make use of article of the code of civil procedure and put a legal question to the supreme court concerning the interpretation of article of the press act the supreme court refused to reply to this question by way of a decision of october czp see relevant domestic law and practice below on march the warsaw court of appeal rejected the applicant appeal against newsweek on formal ground failure to pay the court fee by a judgment of april the warsaw court of appeal dismissed the applicant appeal against polityka by a judgment of july the warsaw regional court allowed the claim against gazeta polska the editor appealed the party settled the case before the court of appeal the applicant submits that ultimately the advertisement wa not published b the proceeding against rzeczpospolita the present case concern the proceeding against rzeczpospolita and it editorinchief by a judgment of march the warsaw regional court dismissed the applicant claim it referred to section of the press act noting that the only requirement that paid advertisement to be published in the press had to comply with were the law and principle of social coexistence zasady współżycia społecznego the editor of rzeczpospolita had been aware of the content of the book publishing the advertisement could have been regarded a endorsing that content which in turn could have been seen a breaching the personal right of third party this could have given rise to civil liability on their part not only were the editor allowed to refuse publication of an advertisement in breach of third party right they were even obliged to do so the applicant appealed referring to his right to freedom of expression he also argued that the firstinstance court had failed to provide any explanation a to why and how the advertisement breached third party right the warsaw court of appeal by a judgment of november allowed his appeal and remitted the case for reexamination the court first held that publication of advertisement wa not covered by freedom of expression it further accepted the applicant argument about the lower court failure to give adequate reason for it judgment that court had held that the text of the advertisement wa in breach of the law and third party personal right without adducing any argument or reason for that view the court further observed that the lower court had made it assessment with reference to the content of the book concerned this wa not correct a under section of the press act lawfulness andor respect for third party personal right had to be examined with reference to the content of the advertisement only and not of the advertised service or the merchandise the content of the book wa irrelevant in the case at hand by a judgment of january the warsaw regional court dismissed the applicant claim the court wa of the view that the advertisement wa incompatible with the newspaper editorial profile it further reiterated that the publication of the advertisement could have been understood a an endorsement of the applicant view expressed in the book this circumstance alone wa sufficient to justify the refusal to publish the advertisement moreover rzeczpospolita and gazeta wyborcza were competitor in the press market the publication of the advertisement could have given rise to a suspicion that the editor of the former were trying to denigrate the latter in the eye of the public further the editor were not obliged by law to endorse the dissemination of view and statement which they did not accept the court concluded that the advertisement did not meet the requirement laid down by section of the press act the court further stated referring to the view expressed by the supreme court in it judgment of january given in other case brought by the applicant and concerning refusal to publish the same advertisement see paragraph below that the principle of commercial and contractual freedom dictated that a publisher wa not under a legal obligation to publish all advertisement submitted to it because it did not have a monopoly on the market the applicant appealed reiterating his earlier argument he expressly relied on article of the convention on february the warsaw court of appeal dismissed his appeal essentially endorsing the view expressed by the regional court the applicant lawyer submitted a cassation appeal against that judgment to the supreme court relying on the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by the constitution and by article of the convention by a judgment of march served on the applicant on june the supreme court dismissed the cassation appeal the court referred to it judgment given in other case initiated by the applicant czp the nasz dziennik case in which it refused to answer a legal question see paragraph below i csk and the polityka case it observed that the press market wa governed by business and commercial freedom it resulted therefrom that publisher of newspaper could not be held to be obliged to publish all advertisement simply at the request of client the court referred to the court judgment in the case of appleby and others v the united kingdom no echr vii it shared the court view that the principle governing the exercise of the freedom of expression were also applicable to commercial speech however it did not necessarily result therefrom that in horizontal relation this freedom could not be limited in compliance with the constitutional principle of proportionality whereas it wa true that section paragraph of the press act could not be said to be fully consistent with other provision of that act it could validly be relied on by publisher wishing to refuse the publication of an advertisement if they were of the view that the advertisement a proposed wa not compatible with the newspaper profile the supreme court concluded that the contested judgment wa ultimately in conformity with the law ii relevant domestic law and practice article of the constitution provides freedom to express opinion and to acquire and disseminate information shall be ensured to everyone preventive censorship of mean of social communication and licensing of the press shall be prohibited article of the constitution read freedom of the person shall receive legal protection everyone shall respect the freedom and right of others no one shall be compelled to do that which is not required by law any limitation upon the exercise of constitutional freedom and right may be imposed only by statute and only when necessary in a democratic state for the protection of it security or public order or to protect the natural environment health or public moral or the freedom and right of other person such limitation shall not violate the essence of freedom and right section of the press act read a follows the press may publish paid advertisement and notice press advertisement shall not be in breach of the law or of the principle of social coexistence advertisement shall be put in such a form a to make it clear that they are not to be identified with the editorial content the publisher and editor shall have the right to refuse the publication of an advertisement if it content or form is incompatible with the editorial profile or character of the newspaper in a decision of october czp the supreme court examined a legal question submitted to it by the warsaw court of appeal in the applicant case against nasz dziennik in it request the court of appeal summarised the difficulty arising in connection with the interpretation of section of the press act on the one hand section provided in paragraph that newspaper publisher had a right to publish advertisement this formulation suggested that they were free to decide on the choice of advertisement to be published on the other hand the provision of paragraph and of that section in so far a they defined situation where a publisher could refuse to publish an advertisement suggested that such refusal wa possible only where that advertisement a proposed failed to meet the requirement laid down in those provision otherwise publisher were obliged under the provision to publish an advertisement a long a it had been duly paid for this conclusion wa further strengthened by the fact that under paragraph of section of the act publisher did not bear any legal responsibility for the content of paid advertisement the court of appeal noted in it question that the freedom of expression of the person trying to place an advertisement had to be weighed against the publisher commercial freedom it further observed that if decisive weight wa given to the publisher freedom to choose the advertisement to be published a form of unlimited control of content by private commercial entity could result comparable to preventive censorship the supreme court endorsed the reasoning of the requesting court that section of the press act could and indeed did give rise to discrepancy in it judicial interpretation a literal interpretation a contrario indicated that a refusal to publish an advertisement wa justified only when one of the four condition laid down in paragraph and wa not fulfilled had the legislator accepted that publisher were completely free in deciding whether to publish an advertisement or to refuse it publication it would have been redundant to list the requirement that an advertisement had to comply with in order to be published hence the majority of legal writer were of the view which wa apparently also shared by the requesting court of appeal that this provision of the press act limited the publisher freedom in respect of commercial advertisement the supreme court expressed the view that it wa difficult to accept such an opinion it observed that many argument could be adduced in support of a contrary opinion however in the circumstance of the case it wa not necessary for that court to give a reply to the legal question posed by the court of appeal a such a reply wa not necessary for a decision on the merit of the case the outcome of the case pending before the court of appeal hinged only on that court assessment of whether the advertisement a proposed wa in breach of the applicable law not on the clarification of the scope of the publisher duty to publish a paid advertisement the supreme court made similar observation a to the interpretation of section of the press act in it two judgment given on january concerning the applicant case i csk and the applicant claim to have the advertisement published wa rejected in both case the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the refusal to publish a paid advertisement by rzeczpospolita which wa subsequently upheld by the court breached his right to freedom of expression a protected by article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility exhaustion of domestic remedy the government argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedy in that he had not availed himself of a constitutional complaint in their view he should have challenged section and of the press act a to it compatibility with the constitution the applicant disagreed he submitted that a constitutional complaint wa not a proper remedy in his case there were no ground on which to contest the constitutionality of the provision concerned it wa merely their interpretation by the court in his case which he contested the court ha held on numerous occasion that in poland a constitutional complaint is an effective remedy for the purpose of article of the convention where the alleged violation of the convention result from the direct application of a legal provision considered by the complainant to be unconstitutional see among other authority szott medyńska v poland dec no october turning to the circumstance of the instant case the court note that the alleged violation originated in the judicial interpretation of section of the press act the court point to the established jurisprudence of the constitutional court which provides that constitutional complaint based solely on an allegedly wrong interpretation of a legal provision are excluded from it jurisdiction a a result such a complaint can not be deemed an effective remedy within the meaning of article of the convention it is precisely such an interpretation and divergence in that interpretation which lie at the core of the present case therefore the constitutional complaint can not be regarded a an effective remedy in the applicant case see among many other authority palusiński v poland dec no echr ciesielczyk v poland no june and sosinowska v poland no october for these reason the government plea of inadmissibility on the ground of nonexhaustion of domestic remedy must be dismissed alleged incompatibility ratione persona with the provision of the convention the government further argued that the application should be declared incompatible ratione persona because it concerned horizontal relation between private party the applicant submitted that the refusal to publish the advertisement for his book had been endorsed by the court acting in the name of the state and that therefore the state had to be held responsible for the content of the judgment and for the outcome of the proceeding the court observes that this objection is a matter which go to the merit of the case and will be addressed a a question of substance the applicant victim status the government further argued that the applicant could not claim to be the victim of a breach of the convention because he had not been negatively affected by the decision complained of he had launched his own website on the internet and had been able despite the publisher refusal to publish the paid advertisement to disseminate information about his book and to sell it it appeared from information he had made available on that website that the third edition of the book had already sold out by the court reiterates that it fall firstly to the national authority to redress any violation of the convention a decision or measure favourable to the applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status a a victim for the purpose of article of the convention unless the national authority have acknowledged either expressly or in substance and then afforded redress for the breach of the convention see inter alia eckle v germany july series a no scordino v italy no gc no echr v and ladent v poland no march the notion of victim is to be interpreted autonomously see gorraiz lizarraga and others v spain no echr iii importantly it doe not imply the existence of prejudice brumărescu v romania gc no echr vii in the present case no domestic decision wa ever given which wa designed for and capable of alleviating the negative impact on the applicant right of the decision complained of since his situation ha not been remedied in any way this objection of the government must be dismissed lack of significant disadvantage the government further submitted that the applicant had not suffered a significant disadvantage because he had not been negatively affected by the decision complained of he had been able to advertise his book on the internet and to sell it the court is of the view that this argument amount to a mere rephrasing of the submission which the government made with regard to the applicant victim status see paragraph above this objection must therefore also be dismissed conclusion the court note that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit applicability of article of the convention the government acknowledged that advertisement and other form of commercial expression may fall within the scope of article of the convention however this provision wa not applicable to the circumstance of the present case because it concerned a dispute between private party whereas the right and freedom enshrined in the convention were of a vertical nature in that they concerned relation between the state and individual the applicant disagreed he wa of the view that article wa applicable to the circumstance of the case the court ha held on a number of occasion that this provision is applicable to advertising and commercial speech see casado coca v spain february series a no a and markt intern verlag gmb h and klaus beermann v germany november series a no it fails to see ground on which to hold otherwise in the present case the court reiterates that it is in the first place for the national authority and in particular the court of first instance and appeal to construe and apply the domestic law see for example iglesias gil and aui v spain no echr v slivenko v latvia gc no echr x and włoch v poland no echr xi however this doe not exempt the state from it general obligation under article of the convention to secure to everyone within it jurisdiction the right and freedom defined in the convention the responsibility of a state may then be engaged a a result of not observing it obligation to enact domestic legislation or of applying existing domestic legislation in a manner incompatible with the convention standard the court reiterates the key importance of freedom of expression a one of the precondition for a functioning democracy the court also reminds the preeminent role of the press in a state governed by the rule of law for example goodwin v the united kingdom march report ii the caselaw of court ha stressed on numerous occasion the function of the press a purveyor of information and

measure of protection may be required especially visàvis journalist and newspaper see özgür gündem v turkey no echr iii where the turkish state wa found to be under a positive obligation to take investigative and protective measure where a pro pkk newspaper and it journalist and staff had been the victim of a campaign of violence and intimidation in determining whether or not a positive obligation exists regard must be had to the fair balance that ha to be struck between the general interest of the community and the interest of the individual the search for which is inherent throughout the convention the scope of this obligation will inevitably vary having regard to the diversity of situation obtaining in contracting state and the choice which must be made in term of priority and resource nor must such an obligation be interpreted in such a way a to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authority see inter alia özgür gündem v turkey cited above and frăsilă and ciocîrlan v romania no may the boundary between the state positive and negative obligation under the convention do not lend themselves to precise definition see verein gegen tierfabriken schweiz vg t v switzerland no gc no echr in both situation whether the obligation are positive or negative the state enjoys a certain margin of appreciation see for example mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no echr extract the breadth of such a margin of appreciation varies depending on a number of factor among which the type of speech at issue is of particular importance whilst there is little scope under article of the convention for restriction on political speech see among many other authority sokołowski v poland no march and kaperzyński v poland no april a wider margin of appreciation is generally available to the contracting state when regulating freedom of expression in relation to matter liable to offend intimate personal conviction within the sphere of moral or especially religion see murphy v ireland no echr ix extract and mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc cited above it is especially relevant for the assessment of the present case that the state have a broad margin of appreciation in the regulation of speech in commercial matter or advertising see markt intern verlag gmb h and klaus beermann v germany cited above series a no and casado coca v spain cited above series a no a in the determination of the existence and scope of the positive obligation of the state arising under article of the convention the court ha had regard to the subject matter of the case to it capacity to contribute to the public debate to the nature and scope of restriction imposed on the exercise of freedom of expression and to the availability of alternative mean by which that liberty could be exercised a well a to the weight to be given to the competing right of other person or of the general public see appleby and others cited above and compliance with article of the conventiona the party submission the government submitted that in the event that the court wa minded to find article applicable to the case the state authority would be responsible only in respect of their positive obligation arising under that provision and not for any direct interference with the applicant right in the present case these obligation had been fully complied with in the polish legal system all individual were free to express their view private party were free to create and shape their relation in compliance with the principle of freedom of economic activity that governed commercial relation in the free market in a democratic society the government considered that the measure taken in the present case had served the legitimate aim of protection of the right of others namely the publisher of the newspaper concerned a to the lawfulness of the restriction imposed on the applicant the government stressed that they had a legal basis in section and of the press act the domestic court when examining the newspaper refusal to publish the advertisement had examined it legal ground they had found that the refusal wa in compliance with the said provision given that the proposed advertisement wa incompatible with the newspaper editorial profile the government further opined that the difficulty in the interpretation of this provision referred to in the supreme court decision of and judgment of had had no impact on the lawfulness of the refusal in the present case those difficulty had arisen essentially because prior to the case brought before the court by the applicant there had been no judicial practice concerning the interpretation to be given to section of the press act the applicant case were the first occasion for the domestic court to examine what balance should be struck between on the one hand the economic freedom of newspaper publisher and on the other private party freedom of expression in the context of information of a commercial nature this absence of relevant judgment had resulted in doubt a to whether publisher were obliged to accede to each and every request to publish a paid advertisement in a newspaper or had a right to refuse to do so the supreme court had developed it jurisprudence in this matter solely on the basis of the case brought by the applicant that caselaw should be regarded a established and would serve in the future a a basis for decision in further case of the same kind they further argued that the applicant should have known that publisher were allowed to refuse to publish an advertisement subject to the requirement that it wa contrary to the law or the principle of social coexistence or incompatible with a publication editorial profile these requirement had never been doubted either by legal scholarship or the judiciary rzeczpospolitas refusal to publish the applicant advertisement had been based on two of these requirement namely inconsistency with the editorial profile and the character of the newspaper the government concluded that the relevant law wa formulated with sufficient precision for the applicant to foresee the consequence of his action namely that the publication of his advertisement could be refused on legal ground a to the issue of necessity in a democratic society the government argued that it wa essential to balance the applicant freedom of expression against the freedom of expression of the press and the publisher freedom of economic activity the refusal of the newspaper rzeczpospolita to publish the applicant advertisement had not prevented him from either advertising or selling his book there had been other easily accessible mean of informing the public about his product such a internet advertising setting up his own internet website launching an internet blog signing up with social network printing and distributing leaflet and poster organising meeting with the public or launching his own newspaper or other publication hence the general public had been informed of the book despite the refusal to publish the applicant advertisement the government submitted that the reason given by the court in the present case had been relevant and sufficient they had found that the proposed advertisement wa incompatible with rzeczpospolitas editorial profile a a serious newspaper dealing with legal economic and social issue and which wa politically neutral and objective conveying information in a proper and respectful manner and avoiding the publication of scandalous and sensationalist text the court had observed that the advertisement concerned the editorinchief and the publisher of a rival newspaper publishing the advert could have created the impression that rzeczpospolita shared the author view and could thus have called it objectivity into question the government further asserted that publishing the advertisement would have been not only contrary to the law but also in breach of professional ethic the court had further been of the view that imposing on the newspaper the obligation to publish it would also have infringed the publisher right to decide on it editorial content the government concluded that the measure complained of had been justified by a pressing social need and were proportionate and therefore compatible with the requirement of article of the convention the applicant submitted that the refusal to publish a paid advertisement by rzeczpospolita which had subsequently been endorsed by the court had breached his right to freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention his book concerned issue of public concern and interest given that gazeta wyborcza wa a powerful newspaper which played an important role in shaping the political view and attitude of it numerous reader the book aimed to present the general public with significant fact concerning the manner in which that newspaper had been created and how it had risen to it position of significance and power no review of his book had ever been published in the printed medium the applicant wa of the view that this wa most likely to be because the book had been embarrassing for the publisher of gazeta wyborcza who had been sufficiently feared and respected to be able to prevent anything hostile to it being published in the press for an effective exercise of the freedom of expression and for a genuine political debate among citizen it wa important that view and fact ignored or silenced by the mainstream medium would be allowed to see the light of day the applicant had been prevented from publishing the advertisement in rzeczpospolita and also in a number of other newspaper the fact that he had been silenced in that way breached both the constitution and the conventionb the court assessment the applicant complains that the refusal to publish a paid advertisement by rzeczpospolita breached his right to the freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention the court observes that the applicant could not publish an advertisement in the rzeczpospolita newspaper owned by a limited liability company a the publisher refused to publish that advertisement subsequently the civil court examined the applicant claim for a decision ordering that newspaper to publish the advertisement the court found against him the court note at the outset that the application concern the outcome of a dispute between two private party in the domestic proceeding the applicant argued that the newspaper wa under a positive obligation to publish a paid advertisement the newspaper publisher relied on it freedom from external interference in the exercise of it freedom of expression and the court endorsed this position the court is of the view that in such a situation the right invoked by the applicant ha to be interpreted and applied with due consideration for the right of the press protected under article of the convention the court ha previously examined case involving access to particular venue or forum for the purpose of exercising the freedom of expression it ha held that notwithstanding the importance of that freedom article doe not bestow any freedom of forum for the exercise of that right a regard entry to private property or even necessarily to all publicly owned property see appleby and others cited above the same finding wa reiterated in berladir and others v russia no july mutatis mutandis in the examination of such case the court took into consideration whether the bar on access to a given forum had the effect of preventing any effective exercise of freedom of expression the instant case however concern not a private venue but a medium whose fundamental freedom of expression is protected under convention the court ha examined a number of case concerning restriction on advertisement in television see vg t verein gegen tierfabriken v switzerland no echr vi animal defender international v the united kingdom gc no april in those case the applicant were prevented from having their advertisement broadcast by a general prohibition imposed on certain type of political speech the court considered that a prohibition of an advertisement by way of a general measure could be justified under article of the convention see animal defender international cited above the instant case differs from the above mentioned in that the general rule examined so far by the court in it caselaw affected directly not only the potential advertiser but also the broadcaster in the present case the refusal to publish the advertisement sought by the applicant did not result from a general ban on broadcasting specific type of commercial speech but from a decision by the newspaper publisher the court ha already held that privately owned newspaper must be free to exercise editorial discretion in deciding whether to publish article comment and letter submitted by private individual or even by their own staff reporter and journalist the state obligation to ensure the individual freedom of expression doe not give private citizen or organisation an unfettered right of access to the medium in order to put forward opinion see mutatis mutandis murphy v ireland no july saliyev v russia no october in the court view these principle apply also to the publication of advertisement an effective exercise of the freedom of the press presupposes the right of the newspaper to establish and apply their own policy in respect of the content of advertisement it also necessitates that the press enjoys freedom to determine it commercial policy in this respect and to choose those with whom it deal in the present case it ha not been argued let alone shown that the applicant had any difficulty in publishing his book or that the authority tried in any way to prevent or dissuade him from publishing it or that more generally the medium market in poland wa not pluralistic the court accepts that the issue examined in that book may contribute to a debate about the mission of the press in polish society the analysis of the political and institutional origin of a national newspaper the financial dealing of it publisher and analysis and comment about that newspaper functioning and role in society were topic of public interest however the character of the issue explored by that book doe not detract from the fact that the paid advertisement proposed by the applicant were essentially aimed at promoting the distribution and sale of his book hence they were primarily designed to further the applicant commercial interest at no point wa the applicant prevented from disseminating information about the book by any mean he wished indeed he created his own internet website through which he informed the general public about the book it content and it potential significance for the public debate in the present case the applicant had recourse to civil proceeding he requested the court to order that newspaper to publish a paid advertisement for his book the domestic court examined his case under the provision of the press act hence the domestic law provided an effective procedural framework within which the applicant could seek to have the substantive issue involved in his case determined by judicial authority the court were well aware of the difficulty arising in the interpretation of the relevant provision of the press act they were of the view that the crux of the case lay in the necessity to adjudicate on conflicting interest and right the applicant right to disseminate idea on the one hand and the constitutionally and internationally guaranteed right and freedom of the publisher such a the right to freedom of expression and freedom of commercial activity on the other a to whether the domestic court correctly applied those provision the court reiterates that the application and interpretation of the domestic law fall primarily within the competency of the domestic authority which are in the nature of thing particularly well placed to settle the issue arising in this connection compare inter alia barthold v germany march series a no the warsaw regional court in it judgment of january had regard to the publisher freedom to shape the newspaper editorial profile subsequently the court of appeal in it judgment of january essentially shared that view ultimately the supreme court when examining the applicant cassation appeal observed that the press wa governed by commercial freedom it wa of the opinion that publisher could not be held to be obliged to publish paid advertisement simply at the request of their client that court wa of the view that the principle governing free speech were also applicable to commercial speech the supreme court referred to it own judgment given in other case brought before it by the applicant it noted that the freedom of expression could be restricted in compliance with the principle of proportionality enshrined in the constitution the court is therefore satisfied that the court carefully weighed the applicant interest against the legitimate right of the publisher such a their own freedom of expression and economic freedom compare and contrast khurshid mustafa and tarzibachi v sweden no december where no such exercise wa performed in addition the supreme court wa aware of the human right issue arising in the case and had recourse to the court interpretation of the positive obligation arising in connection with the freedom of expression in the case of appleby v the united kingdom furthermore the supreme court had regard to the principle of proportionality enshrined in article of the constitution which covered all situation in which the exercise of individual right wa restricted hence the court accepts that the analysis made by the domestic court wa fully compatible with the convention standard the court agrees with the analysis of the case carried out by the domestic court it find that their conclusion that in a pluralistic medium market press publisher should not be obliged to carry advertisement proposed by private party is compatible with the freedom of expression standard under the convention having regard to the circumstance of the case seen a a whole the court is of the view that the state ha not failed to comply with it obligation to secure to the applicant the freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that his right guaranteed in article were violated he drew attention to the fact that the decision of the polish court in several similar lawsuit he brought against different newspaper were inconsistent article in so far a relevant read a follows in the determination of his civil right and obligation everyone is entitled to a fair hearing by a tribunal a the party submission the government reiterated that prior to the applicant case there had been no similar case brought to the attention of the polish court consequently no judicial practice could have been created a regard the existence and scope of a newspaper obligation to publish paid advertisement the supreme court examined a number of case brought before it by the applicant and in a number of decision given between and consolidated it approach to the interpretation of section of the press act it properly balanced the interest and freedom involved in these case weighing the publisher freedom of expression and freedom of economic activity against the right to freedom of expression of the person wishing to publish paid advertisement in the printed medium the applicant did not comment on the government submission b the court assessment in it recent grand chamber judgment in the case of nejdet şahin and perihan şahin v turkey gc no october the court reiterated the main principle applicable in case concerning the issue of conflicting court decision these may be summarised a followsi it is not the court function to deal with error of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far a they may have infringed right and freedom protected by the convention see garcía ruiz v spain gc no echr i likewise it is not it function save in the event of evident arbitrariness to compare different decision of national court even if given in apparently similar proceeding a the independence of those court must be respected see ādamsons v latvia no june ii the possibility of conflicting court decision is an inherent trait of any judicial system which is based on a network of trial and appeal court with authority over the area of their territorial jurisdiction such divergence may also arise within the same court that in itself can not be considered contrary to the convention see santos pinto v portugal no may and tudor tudor cited above iii the criterion that guide the court assessment of the condition in which conflicting decision of different domestic court ruling at final instance are in breach of the fair trial requirement enshrined in article of the convention consist in establishing whether profound and longstanding difference exist in the caselaw of the domestic court whether the domestic law provides for machinery for overcoming these inconsistency whether that machinery ha been applied and if appropriate to what effect see iordan iordanov and others cited above see also beian no cited above ştefan and ştef v romania no and january schwarzkopf and taussik cited above december tudor tudor cited above ştefănică and others cited above and teresa kowalczyk v poland no october iv the court assessment ha also always been based on the principle of legal certainty which is implicit in all the article of the convention and constitutes one of the fundamental aspect of the rule of law see amongst other authority beian no cited above iordan iordanov and others cited above and ştefănică and others cited above v the principle of legal certainty guarantee inter alia a certain stability in legal situation and contributes to public confidence in the court the persistence of conflicting court decision on the other hand can create a state of legal uncertainty likely to reduce public confidence in the judicial system whereas such confidence is clearly one of the essential component of a state based on the rule of law see paduraru v romania no echr xii extract vinčić and others v serbia no and others december and ştefănică and others cited above vi however the requirement of legal certainty and the protection of the legitimate confidence of the public do not confer an acquired right to consistency of caselaw see unédic v france no december caselaw development is not in itself contrary to the proper administration of justice since a failure to maintain a dynamic and evolutive approach would risk hindering reform or improvement see atanasovski v the former yugoslav republic of macedonia no january turning to the present case the court note that the applicant argued that his separate case concerning his claim to have identical advertisement about his book published had been decided differently firstly the court note that the applicant lodged seven identical claim against the publisher of various newspaper with the warsaw regional court that court by judgment dated january may may january and march dismissed his action against nasz dziennik wprost metropol newsweek and polityka respectively having regard to the uniformity of those decision it can not be said that there were discrepancy in that court approach to identical case following the applicant appeal the warsaw court of appeal ordered two of the defendant newspaper wprost and metropol to publish the advertisement concerned those judgment became final a no cassation appeal against them were lodged by the publisher with the supreme court that court wa not therefore given an opportunity to pronounce on the issue involved in them the court further note that the appeal against the publisher of newsweek wa rejected on formal ground that case is therefore of no relevance for the assessment of the present complaint the court further note noted that the warsaw court of appeal when examining the applicant appeal against the publisher of nasz dziennik noted that the interpretation of section of the press act could give rise to difficulty it described those difficulty in detail in the legal question concerning article of the code of civil procedure which it decided to submit to the supreme court see paragraph above the court is therefore satisfied that under the provision of the polish civil procedure there wa a mechanism available to the court for the purpose of clarifying major interpretation difficulty and harmonising the judicial approach to those difficulty by way of a decision of the highest judicial authority and that that mechanism wa resorted to in the present case hence the criterion relied on by the court when dealing with inconsistency in judicial practice were thereby complied with see iordan iordanov and others v bulgaria no it is true that ultimately the supreme court refused to answer that question however a it wa of the view that such an answer wa not necessary for the purpose of that case it can not be said to have been unjustified the court of appeal noted in it question that the freedom of expression of the person trying to place an advertisement had to be weighed against the publisher commercial freedom it further observed that if decisive weight wa given to the publisher freedom a to the choice of advertisement to be published a form of unlimited control of content by private commercial entity could result to preventive censorship moreover there wa no arbitrariness in the decision given in the present case the applicant concern arising in connection with his right to freedom of expression in the context of his case against the rzeczpospolita newspaper were examined in depth at three level of jurisdiction including the supreme court that court accepted the applicant cassation appeal for an examination on the merit a decision given only in respect of case raising important legal issue it is also significant that the supreme court in the present case relied on it own analysis of the issue involved in the interpretation of article made in the applicant previous case iii i csk i csk referred to above it therefore sought thereby to ensure uniformity in it approach in similar case finally the applicant case which serve a a background to the present case and which were brought before the supreme court by way of cassation appeal were decided on the merit in the same manner a the applicant claim to have the advertisement published and were ultimately dismissed the case against nasz dziennik i csk and polityka i csk the court further note the government argument that the decision concerning the existence of an obligation on newspaper publisher to publish each and every paid advertisement proposed to them wa very few and that practically all of them had been given in the applicant case see paragraph above it can not therefore be said that that there were profound and long standing difference in the caselaw or that distinct strand of jurisprudence had developed leading to similar case being decided differently compare and contrast iordan iordanov and others v bulgaria referred to above in such circumstance it can not be said that there were difference in the relevant caselaw that had resulted in judicial uncertainty it follows that this complaint is manifestly illfounded and must be rejected in accordance with article a and of the convention iii alleged violation of article of the convention on account of the unreasonable length of the proceeding the applicant complained that the length of the proceeding had been incompatible with the reasonable time requirement within the meaning of article of the convention however the court note that the applicant failed to lodge a complaint about the breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time under the law of june on complaint about a breach of the right to an investigation conducted and supervised by a prosecutor and to a trial within a reasonable time ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu przygotowawczym prowadzonym lub nadzorowanym przez prokuratora i postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki see charzyński v poland dec no march it follows that this complaint must be rejected under article and of the convention for nonexhaustion of domestic remedy iv other alleged violation of the convention the applicant further complained under article of the convention alleging unfairness of the civil proceeding against him in that the supreme court had failed to address his argument properly the court find that the fact of the case do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the convention it follows that these complaint are manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article and must be rejected pursuant to article for these reason the court unanimously declares the complaint under article of the convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on july pursuant to rule and of the rule of court françoise elens passos ineta ziemele registrar president,,,
52,the applicant wa born in and life in vienna at the time of the event the applicant worked for the association asyl in not which offer legal and social support to asylum seeker and refugee in an amendment to a number of law concerning the status of foreigner and of asylum seeker and concerning relevant proceeding fremdenrechtspaket wa drafted and adopted by parliament the amendment entered into force on january on december the then federal minister for interior affair lp died unexpectedly of an aneurysm at the age of on january the applicant published a statement on the association website entitled one le whats coming now eine weniger wa kommt danach it continued the good news for the new year lp minister for torture and deportation is dead die gute meldung zum jahresbeginn lp bundesministerin für folter und deportation ist tot after referring to some specific individual story of asylum seeker the text stated further that mr p wa a desk war criminal just like many others there have been in the atrocious history of this country completely desensitised indifferent to the consequence of their law and regulation the compliant instrument of a bureaucracy contaminated with racism no decent human is shedding tear over her death lp war eine schreibtischtäterin wie e viele gab in der grausamen geschichte diesis landes völlig abgestumpft gleichgültig gegen die folgen ihrer gesetze und erlässe ein willfähiges werkzeug einer rassistisch verseuchten beamtenschaft kein anständiger mensch weint ihr eine träne nach the applicant concluded the text by suggesting that their goal for the new year wa to fight for a new minister who would make good the damage done by lp so that austria could return to being a country welcoming asylum seeker and a place where human right were respected gp the late minister husband filed a private prosecution privatanklage for defamation against the applicant and the association on september the vienna regional court landesgericht für strafsachen wien convicted the applicant of defamation in respect of the abovequoted passage of the statement and sentenced him to a fine in the amount of eur half of the fine wa suspended for three year it dismissed gps request for recognition of the association liability for it employee action the court found that the average reader would understand the relevant passage of the statement to mean that lp had ordered or tolerated the torture pending expulsion or the deportation of detainee and had violated human right the word torture in particular implied the intentional infliction of physical or psychological suffering an average reader would also place the word deportation deportation in the context of the historical event under the nationalsocialist regime which forcefully deported segregated group of people to ghetto and camp to subject them to forced labour or extermination the statement in question suggested that lp exercised her political function in a particularly despicable way that she wa indifferent to official criminal abuse of authority in relation to asylum seeker and that her action were motivated by racist sadistic xenophobic and nationalsocialist attitude the publication of the statement had triggered considerable reaction from the medium and the public the applicant had been criticised a tactless and disrespectful in response thereto on january the applicant published in a daily newspaper a reply in which he stated that his comment had been directed solely towards lp and he apologised to her family member who were not responsible for the late minister inhumane policy the regional court acknowledged that a criminal charge of defamation wa at odds with the right to freedom of expression a guaranteed by the convention it found that the voicing of opinion by refugee association criticising politician and their legislative project represented an important corrective element and that the limit of acceptable criticism were particularly widely drawn in the context of the present case however in the court opinion the published statement overstepped the limit of acceptable criticism the legislative background to the amendment of the law governing foreigner and asylum seeker and the fact that criticism wa allowed to be shocking still could not justify positioning lp in a nationalsocialist and racist context and suggesting that she had tolerated the intentional physical illtreatment of detainee pending expulsion or deportation such accusation against the then only recently passed away lp together with the acclamation of her death and the call on decent people not to mourn her passing clearly went beyond the limit of acceptable criticism in a democratic society moreover the allegation made by the applicant had not been proven to be true nor had he shown any journalistic diligence in that regard the applicant filed an appeal on point of law and fact and also appealed against the sentence on may the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht wien dismissed his appeal referring to the reasoning of the firstinstance court it conceded that the word deportation nowadays had acquired the additional meaning of expulsion or removal and wa not only used in the context of the nationalsocialist regime but also in the context of the forced expulsion of foreigner however the context of the word in which it had been used a desk war criminal just like many others there have been in the atrocious history of this country acted a a reminder of the nationalsocialist history of the country therefore even though the statement at issue were political value judgment politische wertungen the applicant had not produced any proof of a factual basis for his allegation the applicant had further argued that following the caselaw of the european court of human right and of the domestic court with regard to article the impugned statement wa covered by freedom of expression the court of appeal however found that even such caselaw did not provide carte blanche for the applicant to make comparison with the nationalsocialist regime without any factual basis that decision wa served on the applicant counsel on june on november the applicant lodged a request for the renewal of the criminal proceeding erneuerung de strafverfahrens pursuant to article a of the code of criminal procedure with the aim of having the proceeding reopened and the conviction set aside on october the supreme court dismissed the request it stated that the admittedly broad limit of tolerable criticism in the political discourse did not cover excessive value judgment without any factual basis statement made in even heated political conflict needed to respect a minimum of decency and moderation in the present case the supreme court found that the evaluation by the court had rightly led to the conclusion that the text in question justified the limitation of the applicant right to freedom of expression the value judgment suggesting criminal behaviour on the part of lp had no factual basis the court had not misjudged the considerable public interest in the discussion concerning migration and asylum policy however the applicant statement had not contributed to that public discussion since they were directed at defaming and discrediting the late minister the court further noted that the sanction imposed wa in view of the disrespectful statement and their temporal proximity to lp death appropriate and even moderate the supreme court decision wa served on the applicant counsel on november ii relevant domestic law article of the criminal code strafgesetzbuch defines defamation a follows a it may be perceived by a third party anyone who make an accusation against another of having a contemptible character or attitude or of behaving contrary to honour or morality and of such a nature a to male him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six month or a fine the person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true a regard the offence a defined in paragraph he shall also not be liable if circumstance are established which gave him sufficient reason to assume that the statement wa true article of the criminal code strafgesetzbuch a in force until january read in the case of an offence under section or of this criminal code committed against a deceased or missing person his or her spouse or close relative or sibling shall be entitled to ask for prosecution the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the austrian court judgment had violated his right to freedom of expression he relied on article of the convention which read everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the court note that the complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the court note that it is common ground between the party that the vienna regional court judgment of september upheld by the court of appeal constituted an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the convention an interference contravenes article of the convention unless it is prescribed by law pursues one or more of the legitimate aim referred to in paragraph and is necessary in a democratic society for achieving such an aim or aim the party submission the government submitted that the interference had been in accordance with the law had pursued a legitimate aim and had been necessary in a democratic society the judgment of the austrian court had likewise pursued a legitimate aim namely the protection of the right and reputation of others moreover the interference had been proportionate to it aim and the reason adduced had been relevant and sufficient the conviction had been based on article taken in conjunction with article of the criminal code regarding the necessity of the interference the government argued that in case which require a balancing of the respective interest under article and of the convention the domestic court enjoyed a certain margin of appreciation in the instant case the domestic court had classified the statement in question a a value judgment lacking a sufficient basis in fact in doing so the domestic court had interpreted the wording of the impugned statement in it overall context they had also taken into account that the limit of acceptable criticism were drawn more widely with regard to politician and that it had been the applicant intention to contribute to a general debate on a subject of public interest namely the right and the protection of asylum seeker and the development of the law in this field they had also considered the recent event and development in the austrian asylum and alien law relied on by the applicant in support of his allegation and had carefully weighed up the applicant argument moreover they had taken account of the wording used by the applicant and the fact that the statement had been made immediately after the minister death against this background they concluded that the impugned passage amounted to an unjustified personal attack on the late minister herself lastly the sanction imposed on him had been moderate a an amount of only eur had been set by way of fine suspended on probation in the applicant view the interference had neither been in accordance with the law nor had it pursued a legitimate aim a deceased minister would no longer have any interest in pursuing a political career and the interest of her surviving husband were not of the same kind or intensity since he wa not a politician and did not wish to pursue a political career the content of the applicant statement did not essentially concern the person of the deceased minister but rather the policy for which she had to be held liable this wa made clear by the reference to bureaucracy contaminated by racism this value judgment had a factual basis namely the constantly deteriorating situation of foreigner and asylum seeker in austria in the applicant view the deceased minister had represented an extremist position within austrian society especially in the eye of people who fought for human right a she had combined cruelty with bonhomie and charm a wa often the case with austrian who committed war crime during world war ii austrian society had closely observed the criminal proceeding against the applicant and had clearly understood that he wa merely showing commitment and concern for a good cause even if the statement might have been drafted in a more cautious way the applicant had nevertheless not exceeded the boundary of legitimate political criticism the court assessmenta the principle established by the court caselaw according to the court wellestablished caselaw the test of necessity in a democratic society requires the court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a pressing social need whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason given by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient see the sunday time v the united kingdom no april series a no edition plon v france no echr iv standard verlags gmb h v austria no no june in assessing whether a need exists and what measure should be adopted to deal with it the national authority are left a certain margin of appreciation the court reiterates that in matter of freedom of expression it task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation the court will look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient and whether they were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see among many other authority cojocaru v romania no february there is no doubt that article enables the reputation of others that is to say of all individual to be protected but in such case the requirement of such protection have to be weighed against the interest of an open discussion of political issue see lingens v austria july series a no the right to protection of reputation is a right which is protected by article of the convention a part of the right to respect for private life an attack on a person reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see a v norway no april axel springer ag v germany gc no february the domestic authority are therefore faced with the difficult task of balancing two conflicting value namely freedom of expression on the one hand and the right to respect for reputation on the other braun v poland no november the margin of appreciation left to the national authority in assessing whether such a need exists and what measure should be adopted to deal with it is not however unlimited but go hand in hand with european supervision by the court whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article where the balancing exercise ha been undertaken by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the court would require strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see von hannover v germany no gc no and echr the court ha already had occasion to lay down the relevant principle which must guide it assessment in this area it ha thus identified a number of criterion in the context of balancing the competing right see von hannover no cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc no february the relevant criterion thus defined are contribution to a debate of public interest the degree of notoriety of the person affected the subject of the news report the prior conduct of the person concerned the content form and consequence of the publication and where appropriate the circumstance in which the statement wa made see print zeitungsverlag gmb h v austria no october and mutatis mutandis couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no november dealing appropriately with the dead out of respect for the feeling of the deceased relative fall within the scope of article see with further reference hadri vionnet v switzerland no february edition plon v france cited above and putistin v ukraine no november on the other hand there is little scope under article of the convention for restriction on freedom of expression in the area of political speech or debate where freedom of expression is of the utmost importance or in matter of public interest brasilier v france no april therefore the limit of acceptable criticism are drawn more widely a regard a politician than they are a regard a private individual unlike the latter the former inevitably and knowingly lay himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalist and the public at large and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance see lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc no and echr iv see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france cited above nevertheless the court ha also found that regardless of the forcefulness of political struggle it is legitimate to try to ensure that they abide by a minimum degree of moderation and propriety especially a the reputation of a politician even a controversial one must benefit from the protection afforded by the convention lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france cited above moreover a clear distinction must be made between criticism and insult if the sole intent of a particular form of expression is to insult a person an appropriate sanction would not in principle constitute a violation of article of the convention mutatis mutandis kincses v hungary no january in it caselaw the court ha distinguished between statement of fact and value judgment the classification of a statement a fact or a a valuejudgment is a matter which first and foremost fall within the margin of appreciation of the national authority in particular the domestic court see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no however the court can change this classification under it supervisory role see kharmalov v russia no october pinto pinheiro marque v portugal no january in previous case the court ha emphasised that the truth of value judgment is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article however even where a statement amount to a value judgment there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it failing which it will be excessive jerusalem v austria no echr ii a the court ha noted in previous case the difference lie in the degree of factual proof which ha to be established see scharsach and news verlagsgesellschaft v austria no echr xi a regard value judgment which have been found by the national court to be of a defamatory character the court ha assessed the national court finding on the question of whether the language used in the statement wa of an excessive or dispassionate nature whether an intention of defaming or stigmatising the opponent wa disclosed and if the statement wa built on a sufficient factual basis see lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france cited above and kincses v hungary cited above the court further considers that the use of the term nazi doe not automatically justify a conviction for defamation on the ground of the special stigma attached to it see scharsach and news verlagsgesellschaft v austria no echr xi concerning the term neofascist see karman v russia no december b application of the above principle in the present case the court observes that the interference with the applicant freedom of expression wa based on article and of the criminal code that law is formulated with sufficient precision to enable a citizen to regulate his conduct and the applicant doe not provide any reasonable argument against this assumption accordingly the interference is prescribed by law the court further agrees with the government that the interference did pursue the aim of the protection of the reputation or right of others namely those of lp and the close member of her family in particular her husband which constitutes a legitimate aim within the meaning of paragraph of article see edition plon v france cited above the court like the party considers that the applicant statement concerned an issue of public interest and may be seen a a contribution to a political debate of public interest namely that concerning the situation of asylum seeker and foreigner under the then new immigration police act fremdenpolizeigesetz and the asylum act asylgesetz this intention is shown by the reporting of specific individual story of asylum seeker the court note that the domestic court classified the statement under consideration a a value judgment the court will proceed on the assumption that this classification is correct it is furthermore undisputed that lp a former federal minister for the interior had been a public figure and wa still remembered by people at the time of publication of the impugned statement however the press release wa issued on the day after her unexpected death a fact that intensified the impact of the word used the applicant statement wa published within the immediate period of her family grief and wa likely to cause considerable damage to the late minister reputation see lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france cited above the court observes that the timing of the impugned statement is a relevant circumstance in the present case and therefore ha to be taken into consideration when balancing the conflicting right under article and the statement wa an expression of satisfaction with the sudden death of lp the applicant made the day after she had passed away to express insult on the day after the death of the insulted person contradicts elementary decency and respect to human being see edition plon v france cited above see also leroy v france no october and is an attack on the core of personality right a regard the content of the applicant statement the court considers that the applicant did not discus the subject matter in a general and substantial manner but immediately launched a personal attack on the late minister he first of all expressed satisfaction about her death suggesting that no decent human should feel grief about her passing away and then continuing by comparing her to highranking nazi official who had committed atrocity and war crime during the second world war by calling her a desk war criminal schreibtischtäterin it is true that in the statement published on january in the newspaper der standard the applicant apologised to the family of lp for his statement but even before this court he insisted that the comparison of lp to nazi war criminal had been correct and justified the court however considers that even if regarded a value judgement such serious and particularly offensive comparison immediately after lp death demand a particularly solid factual basis in this respect the court considers that the applicant did not make any distinction between the person of lp and the politics she stood for from his point of view the applicant argued that lp had shown disreputable character trait in the course of the political negotiation concerning several provision of the asylum law which constituted clear violation of the individual right granted by the federal constitution and the convention however the court observes that the vienna court of appeal carefully examined this argument and came to the conclusion that the constitutional court had confirmed the compatibility of almost all these legal provision with the right enshrined in both the convention and the federal constitution the applicant further argued that a factual basis for lp alleged motif wa apparent in a tv interview she gave after the conviction of four police officer who had been found guilty of the torture of a person being detained pending expulsion the vienna court of appeal evaluated this argument and found that lp unwillingness to apologise in the republic name did not go to show that lp had ordered or at least tolerated the torture further evidence submitted by the applicant wa of a general kind regarding the political situation in austria a a whole and therefore did not provide a sufficient factual basis for the personal accusation against lp lastly the applicant submitted copy of press interview with the head of other ngo and newspaper article in order to show that his opinion that the situation of asylum seeker in austria wa constantly deteriorating wa shared by others having examined these document the court can not identify a factual basis for the motif of lp a alleged by the applicant within these same document therefore the court considers that the reason given by the court were relevant and sufficient a regard the proportionality of the sanction the court note that the applicant wa ordered to pay a fine of eur half of the fine being suspended on probation that amount appears moderate taking into account the nature of the applicant statement and the circumstance in which it wa made and disseminated therefore the penalty imposed can not be found disproportionate it follows that there ha been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the complaint admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on january pursuant to rule and of the rule of court fatoş aracıandrás sajódeputy registrar president,,,
53,in and life in bucharest the applicant wa represented by mr cl popescu a lawyer practising in bucharest the government were represented successively by their agent m c brumar mr v mocanu and m sm teodoroiu of the romanian ministry of foreign affair background to the case the applicant is a judge attached to the bucharest court of appeal in march the applicant wrote an article about the president of the court of cassation under the heading nothing about how a comrade prosecutor ha become the president of all judge it read to my great grandfather no killed by the communist in when the communist camp wa becoming more unbearable the current president of the court of cassation wa appointed prosecutor in the town where i wa born the town had a steel industry and a shipyard and therefore wa crawling with member of the securitate from small informant to the most privileged and smooth torturer i wa twelve year old and i wa in the sixth grade because she wa almost always at work and in order to spend a much time a possible with u my mother used to take me and my younger brother to the parade on august once we were taken to a stadium to see nicolae ceauşescu who had travelled to our town by helicopter i remember that we stood for countless hour under the scorching sun there were many people in shabby clothes all of u were standing upright repeating the slogan next to me a woman wa only mouthing the ovation because she wa so tired so when i turned my head under the scorching sun i saw a man grabbing her arm and telling her discreetly to follow him only because she had mouthed the word i wa no longer interested in seeing the great leader we left and after we had left the stadium well behind i kept asking my mum why meanwhile the president of the court of cassation wa a rising prosecutor how did the comrade prosecutor fight to root out the enemy of the socialist order and for the pursuit of the new man naturally with her weapon the case file i started to imagine what could happen in the dungeon from where some came out dishonoured broken and scared and many did not come out alive who wa hurting them what did those who got hurt and those who were hurting them looked like where are the mark even today there is no desire to find out afterwards in the seventh grade during my internship in agriculture i saw female detainee on the field where we were harvesting tomato they were wearing a thick uniform with a striped skirt and a scarf on their head i wanted to memorise one of their face the detainee status seemed incompatible to me with being a woman they were cry and asking u to come near them a if we had been their own child other woman appeared authoritarian dressed in uniform fitted with leather belt my mum told me that many of them had been convicted for abortion woman chose to kill their unborn because they did not have the mean to raise them in addition to this internal turmoil they were being hunted down by the police miliție and the prosecutor how did the comrade prosecutor manage at that time naturally still for the pursuit of the new man for me the world that had already taken shape consisted of severe poverty the silence and terror from the earth surface and the unknown hell from the dungeon from where scream were never heard the prosecutor were somewhere above in an untouchable shining world which made it impossible to see the sky for all those in my world all these comrade usurper of christ and his law sternly guarded the communist prison the comrade prosecutor ha also floated above u omnipresent for fourteen year until when she transformed into a judge that is to say when i wa twentysix year old during all this time i did my homework by candlelight the candle glued to the edge of a jarfood wa rationed cold water only ran for two hour a day warm water wa long gone we shivered with cold indoors we waited at bus stop until we were freezing and afterwards we were lucky if we found room on the bus footboard to go to school now i realise that all this time long a my entire childhood and adolescence ha not been wasted because the comrade prosecutor ha accomplished so much a to become the president of all judge herself the president of the country appointed her in in a european state where the justice system is continuously being reformed that is to say to the old man a new face that is why the result is and will be an eternal failure the applicant name wa in the byline which also stated that she wa a judge attached to the bucharest court of appeal the article wa printed both in a national newspaper cotidianul and on an internet news site juridicero disciplinary and codeofconduct proceeding against the applicant disciplinary proceeding against the applicant on march the judicial investigation unit inspecția judiciară the ij attached to the superior council of the judiciary consiliul superior al magistraturii the csm opened a preliminary investigation against the applicant on it own motion on the ground that the article published by her wa referring to the professional career of the president of the court of cassation on april the ij produced a note concerning the article published by the applicant and proposed that the note be forwarded to the disciplinary commission for judge comisia de disciplină pentru judecători the cdj attached to the csm to establish whether a disciplinary investigation had to be opened against the applicant for breaching article a of law no concerning conduct of judge and prosecutor affecting their professional honour and dignity the ij held that the article had drawn a parallel between the oppression of the communist regime and the rise of the president of the court of cassation who had worked a a prosecutor at that time judge lds had been appointed president of the court of cassation in lawfully after she had passed the lawfully required vetting process to ensure that she had not been a member of or had collaborated with the secret service before suggesting that she had behaved inappropriately at the time when she had been a prosecutor without providing specific fact had made it impossible for the ij to verify the allegation the article the applicant had put her name to had introduced the idea that judge lds had carried out her professional duty unlawfully between and when she had worked a a prosecutor the distorted presentation of judge ldss professional activity and the suggestion of questionable moral behaviour on her part had resulted in the president of the court of cassations professional reputation being damaged the applicant personal opinion expressed in the article had constituted behaviour calling into question the honour and professional integrity of judge lds under relevant national and international law free speech wa subject to exception when a person right to honour reputation and personal image were affected also when exercising it judge had to behave in such a way a to preserve the dignity of their office and the independence and impartiality of the judiciary by expressing publicly her opinion about the professional activity of a judge the applicant had breached the boundary of the duty of discretion which had implied moderation and restraint in presenting her opinion the ij took the view that in the applicant case there had been evidence suggesting that the disciplinary offence set out in article a of law no had been committed it considered that the boundary of the right to freedom of expression had been overstepped and that the applicant assessment of the court of cassations president professional activity had been conducted in a manner capable of creating a negative image about the way she had behaved a a prosecutor on april the cdj ordered that a disciplinary investigation be initiated against the applicant for the disciplinary offence set out in article a of law no on may the ij produced a note about the outcome of the disciplinary investigation concerning the applicant and proposed that the note be forwarded to the cdj to establish whether disciplinary proceeding had to be instituted against the applicant by relying on some of the argument of the note of april see paragraph above the ij took the view that there wa evidence in the case that might suggest that the element of the disciplinary offence set out in article a of law no had been met in the applicant case on may the cdj closed the proceeding against the applicant in so far a they concerned the commission by the applicant of the alleged disciplinary offence set out in article a of law no however the cdj referred the case to the judge section of the csm secția pentru judecători a consiliului superior al magistraturii the sjcsm for it to determine whether the applicant had breached article of the code of conduct for judge the code it held that article a of law no concerned circumstance where a judge or prosecutor had affected his or her own professional honour and dignity or the reputation of the justice system by his or her own action and conduct this had not been the applicant case her article had been written in a literary manner had referred to aspect of the communist era which had been well known and had reflected the restriction imposed on the right of the people during those time which the applicant had been recalling the article had also contained accurate information concerning the fact that judge lds had worked a a prosecutor and a a judge and that starting from she had been appointed president of the court of cassation the applicant had not used violent or foul language capable of disturbing public opinion and her article had not had a significant medium impact however the manner in which the applicant article had been written had created a negative image of how judge lds had carried out her duty a a prosecutor during communism by using the expression comrade prosecutor in the title of the article the applicant had implied that the president of the court of cassation had been at fault for having become the president of all judge even though she had been a prosecutor during the communist regime by contrasting the situation of the people who were poor silent and oppressed with that of the prosecutor lds who wa characterised untouchable and rising the applicant had practically held lds guilty for the fact that she had had a superior status because of her position a a prosecutor also from the content of the article it could be understood that the case file processed by lds during communism had been used a a mean of oppression in order to root out the enemy of the socialist order and for the pursuit of the new man or to convict woman for abortion in addition the applicant stated generically in the article that all these comrade implying also the comrade prosecutor mentioned in the title of the article had been usurper of christ and his law and had sternly guarded the communist prison lastly the article noted ldss appointment a president of the court of cassation and referred to the fourteen year she had worked a a prosecutor during the communist regime when she ha accomplished so much a to become the president of all judge herself the cdj took the view that by writing the article in the abovementioned manner the applicant had brought into question her compliance with the relevant legal provision concerning the professional conduct of legal professional by relying on amongst other thing article of the code article of the convention the caselaw of the european court of human right the court and on the applicant statement the cdj held that the applicant had overstepped the limit of expression that had to comply with the duty of discretion thus the balance between an individual right to freedom of expression and a democratic state legitimate interest in ensuring that a person holding public office had complied with the scope of article of the convention had been broken the cdj held furthermore that by expressing opinion which could make a reasonable observer that is to say a wellintentioned disinterested and informed person doubt a colleague professional integrity and morality the applicant had overstepped the limit of freedom of expression in relation to that person right to personal image honour and reputation therefore there had been evidence suggesting that the applicant had breached article of the code because in the article under her name she had implied that lds had not performed her professional duty lawfully between and when she had been working a a prosecutor the cdj lastly held that the malicious and distorted presentation of ldss professional activity and the suggestion that her behaviour had been questionable without any supporting evidence in that regard had caused unfounded suspicion to be raised about ldss professionalism the personal opinion expressed by the applicant in her article had amounted to conduct that had affected the right to personal image honour and reputation of the judge conduct proceeding against the applicant decision by the sjcsm in a decision of october the sjcsm held that the applicant article had breached article of the code which set out one of the limitation imposed on an officer of the court right to freedom of expression by relying on similar argument to the one relied on by the cdj see paragraph above the sjcsm held further that the applicant article had been written in a manner that had created a negative image of how judge lds had carried out her duty a a prosecutor during communism the sjcsm dismissed the applicant argument that her article had merely been a literary essay and found that she had overstepped the limit of freedom of expression that had to comply with the duty of discretion thus the balance between her individual right to freedom of expression and a democratic state legitimate interest in ensuring that a person holding public office had complied with the scope of article of the convention had been broken the applicant argument that article of the code could not be read without taking into account the definition of good faith set out in article of law no could not be accepted given that that article defined bad faith and serious negligence and concerned exclusively the exercise of professional function by judge or prosecutor the sjcsm also reiterated the cdjs finding concerning the applicant conduct see paragraph above in addition the sjcsm held that in it decision of march declaring unconstitutional the recently passed legislation on lustration the constitutional court had noted that in their opinion submitted to the court the council of the romanian prosecutor association had stated that in accordance with the relevant law in force during communist time civilian prosecutor had been competent to investigate only ordinary offence not political offence and that prosecutor had not only not served the regime but had been the only obstacle against abuse committed by repressive body in contrast to the abovementioned point the applicant had referred to the case file processed by lds during that time a being used a a mean of oppression in order to root out the enemy of the socialist order and for the pursuit of the new man or to convict woman of abortion without presenting any concrete evidence she wa therefore practically blaming the president of the court of cassation simply because she had worked a a prosecutor during communism thus she had clearly affected the professional and moral integrity of a fellow judge the applicant challenge against the sjcsm decision on december the applicant challenged the decision before the plenary of the csm she argued that article of the code concerned the expression of an opinion but failed to define the concept in the absence of a definition of this concept it could be reasonably argued that it meant expressing a subjective point of view however in order to affect a person image honour and reputation such a personal opinion had had to clearly and expressly concern concrete act and fact capable of compromising the professional integrity or the morality of that person her article had not contained any explicit clear statement concerning the morality and professional integrity of judge lds her essay had contained only several rhetorical question which had not amounted to a categorical opinion also by using the expression comrade prosecutor she had referred to an undeniable fact within the framework of portraying the communist time relying on international and european instrument concerning judge the applicant argued further that those instrument required special diligence in case concerning the disciplinary investigation of judge including a careful selection and assessment of strictly objective and essential element so that any exposure of a judge to unacceptable pressure would be avoided the same requirement had to be complied with in case of a conduct investigation given that pursuant to domestic law an acknowledgement of a breach of the code amounted to a disciplinary sanction which would prevent her career advancement unlike in other european state the romanian code had not been merely a guide on moral issue but a disguised disciplinary code her conduct which had consisted in her publishing a literary article depicting her personal experience had been examined in a deficient manner by breaching the highly important objectivity criterion set out in the relevant international instrument thus some segment and expression from the text had been assessed excessively and had been given subjectively a certain meaning which had been preferred by the investigator also the rule and principle concerning a judge duty of discretion had been misunderstood and had been interpreted very rigidly by relying on argument that had had no connection to the text the fact that the disciplinary proceeding had been diverted into codeofconduct proceeding supported the argument of the pressure imposed of it own motion by an independent body which had not been created to investigate judge the applicant also argued that her essay had concerned the post of president of the court of cassation and had not referred to a colleague because she had not had any interest in lds a a person under the relevant international rule concerning judge a judge had to be more tolerant and open to question and criticism since he or she wa very exposed to the public that wa even more so in case of judge exercising an official state function the person exercising an official state function wa a subject of public interest and therefore it wa natural that all aspect concerning that person past and present career be debated publicly by any person lastly the applicant argued that her essay had been part of a series of other essay that she had already published and had not been a single and isolated work decision by the csms plenary by a decision of january the csms plenary dismissed the applicant challenge it held that the applicant status a an officer of the court had not deprived her of her right to freedom of expression however her conduct consisting of the statement she had made in her article published in the press had breached an officer of the court duty of discretion thus the balance between an individual right to freedom of expression and a democratic state legitimate interest in ensuring that a person holding public office had complied with the scope of article of the convention had been broken an officer of the court duty of discretion implied moderation and restraint in presenting his or her opinion the applicant had been entitled to express her opinion on some aspect concerning the activity of the justice system however the manner of making some of her statement had broken the abovementioned balance especially since there wa no evidence suggesting that under the circumstance the expression used had represented for her the only way of conveying the information she had intended to present by publishing the article by the manner of presenting the event and the expression used the applicant had affected the moral and professional integrity of a fellow judge her statement had not been value judgment but had in fact conveyed certain specific point and had been a clear and unequivocal personal opinion concerning the moral and professional integrity of the president of the court of cassation her argument that her article had concerned exclusively the post of president of the court of cassation had been illfounded the opinion expressed in the article had concerned the person holding that post since a distinction could not be made between the post and the person holding it moreover presenting the reality of communist time could have been done in a le intense manner which would not have affected a colleague professional integrity and honour and with a focus on the problem faced by the justice system the plenary also held that the applicant statement had to be examined in the context of the lack of trust in the justice system that had been apparent for a long time and which had seriously affected it authority and the appearance of impartiality clearly a judge should have known better than anyone the risk of statement which could have a significant impact on the reputation of the system in this context using balanced language with an objective presentation of the system deficiency wa better than making statement breaching professional conduct about a colleague therefore the applicant argument that her essay had not contained a categorical opinion but only literary rhetorical question could not be accepted the manner in which the applicant had chosen to express her opinion about the reality of the communist regime in suggesting that a fellow magistrate had had questionable conduct and professional evolution had resulted in unjustified doubt being raised about the moral and professional integrity of the president of the court of cassation lastly the csms plenary concluded that the personal opinion expressed by the applicant in her article had amounted to conduct that had affected the right to personal image honour and reputation of judge ldsthe applicant appeal against the decision by the csms plenary the applicant appealed against the csms plenarys decision before the court of cassation and reiterated the argument of her challenge of december against the sjcsms decision of october see paragraph above judgment of the court of cassation in a final judgment of november the court of cassation dismissed the applicant appeal a illfounded it held that the applicant article had presented in a distorted way the professional activity of the president of the court of cassation suggesting that she had behaved questionably without presenting supporting evidence the expression used by the applicant such a comrade prosecutor all these comrade usurper of christ and his law and have sternly guarded the communist prison may have caused a reasonable observer that is to say a wellintentioned disinterested and informed person to doubt the moral and professional integrity of the person targeted by the article and clearly overstepped the boundary of the applicant duty of discretion according to the relevant international instrument and the court caselaw the freedom of expression of officer of the court wa exercised mainly under the umbrella of the court caselaw and of the convention both a regard the duty and responsibility incumbent on those who serve justice and a regard the limitation imposed on their right which were necessary to guarantee the authority and impartiality of the justice system a a result the applicant argument that by presenting in an exclusively literary manner her personal life experience she had not tarnished the dignity of the position of judge or the independence and impartiality of the judiciary could not be accepted because the article had contained clear reference to the professional activity and the behaviour of the president of the court of cassation and had made reference to the communist period when she had worked a a prosecutor the court held furthermore that the applicant argument that the disciplinary proceeding had been diverted into conduct proceeding on the motion of an independent body which had not been created to investigate alleged misconduct by judge could also not be accepted the rule and regulation concerning the organisation and function of the csm and it body provided expressly for a procedure concerning the examination of alleged breach of the code which wa different from the procedure set out for the examination of alleged disciplinary offence also the manner in which the decision taken during these separate set of proceeding could be challenged wa different therefore the cdjs decision of may see paragraph above had not represented a diversion of the disciplinary proceeding into codeofconduct proceeding other relevant information other csm and administrative proceeding brought by the applicant on december the applicant asked the csm to remove from her professional file the sjcsms decision of october the csms plenarys decision of january the court of cassations judgment of november and any other information concerning the alleged breach of the code by her in addition she asked the csm to annul it decision to introduce the code she argued that the csms plenarys decision to introduce the code and the code itself had been unconstitutional and therefore any information concerning an alleged breach of the code by her in her professional case file had been unconstitutional on january the csms plenary dismissed the applicant request a illfounded reasoning that there had been no legal ground for removing the document indicated by her from her professional file in addition the decision to introduce the code and the code itself had not been unconstitutional on april the applicant brought administrative proceeding against the csm seeking to have the relevant document and any other information concerning the alleged breach of the code by her removed from her professional file and the csms decision to introduce the code annulled and article of the code struck down in addition she raised an unconstitutionality objection concerning the decision to introduce the code she argued that amongst other thing article of the code wa unlawful because it wa unclear and lacked precision in so far a the person who wa protected by this article wa concerned in particular it wa unclear whether the protection provided by the article in question concerned a colleague who wa working for the same court a the officer of the court under investigation or one who wa working for any other court in the country a finding that an officer of the court had breached the code could have negative consequence on his or her career in so far a professional evaluation and career advancement were concerned on september the piteşti court of appeal the court of appeal referred the applicant unconstitutionality objection concerning the csm decision to introduce the code to the constitutional court the constitutional court proceeding appear to be still pending in a judgment of october which wa amenable to appeal the court of appeal rejected the administrative proceeding brought by the applicant against the csm a illfounded there is no evidence in the file whether this set of proceeding ended in a final judgment information submitted to the court by the party the applicant participation in competition for post at the court of cassation on february the csm asked the ij to produce a report on the professional integrity of the candidate including the applicant who had been declared eligible to participate in a competition organised from january to may for promotion to the court of cassation on april the ij produced the report concerning the applicant it noted that i following press allegation about unlawful rent reimbursement claim made by the applicant the relevant authority had stopped paying for her rent and she had initiated court proceeding against the authority ii the sjcsm had decided to impose a disciplinary penalty on the applicant following a conflict she had had with a colleague in but the decision had not been final at the time of the report iii and that according to the final sjcsm decision of october see paragraph above the applicant had breached article of the code subsequently the ij concluded that the applicant had not met the necessary requirement of conduct duty and integrity to compete for a court of cassation post on january and november the csm informed the government that the applicant had met the lawful condition for participation in the competition see paragraph above but she had failed to attend the actual exam the outcome of the conduct proceeding against her had not prevented her from applying for promotion according to the relevant legal provision the sjcsms decision of october had been attached to the applicant professional file had to be taken into account during her professional evaluation and would be effective for three year the applicant professional appraisal for and had not been finalised because of objective administrative reason on june the csm informed the applicant that a judge possible promotion to the court of cassation wa assessed in the light of a candidate last three finalised professional appraisal attached to his or her professional file the rating of a judge activity in each of the appraisal had to be very good for him or her to be eligible to participate in the competition an appraisal report finding concerning a judge integrity wa effective only for the threeyear period under assessment and did not have any effect on subsequent report given the manner in which the rating were calculated a codeofconduct penalty could not result on it own in the officer of the court not being given a very good rating in his or her appraisal report since the csm had examined seven case concerning possible breach of article of the code by judge and prosecutor in two case including the applicant case the sjcsm had found that article of the code had been breached while in the remaining five case it had been decided in final decision that the aforementioned article had not been breached on november the president of the bucharest court of appeal informed the government that the applicant would not be eligible to apply for promotion to the court of cassation until january regardless of the outcome of her appraisal because in the court of cassation had confirmed the disciplinary penalty imposed on the applicant for the event which had taken place in see paragraph above the court of cassations judgment of april in a final judgment of april published in the official gazette no of february the court of cassation allowed the administrative proceeding brought by judge gb who wa attached to a county court who had been found to have breached article of the code following a public statement concerning the moral integrity of lds who had been the president of the court of cassation at the time of the statement against the csm seeking to have article of the code struck down and an order that the judgment be published in the official gazette the court held that the article in question wa unlawful because it wa unclear and had lacked precision in so far a the person who wa protected by this article wa concerned in particular it wa unclear whether the protection provided by the article in question concerned a colleague who wa working for the same court a the judge under investigation or who wa working for any other court in the country a finding that an officer of the court had breached the code could have had negative consequence on his or her career in so far a the professional evaluation and career advancement were concerned in a final judgment of december the court of cassation allowed the proceeding brought by judge gb seeking to have the final sjcsm decision finding her responsible for breaching article of the code annulled with reference to the final judgment of april see paragraph above information concerning the government former agent on january the government asked the court for an extension of the initial timelimit set for the submission of their observation on the admissibility and merit of the applicant case in a letter which wa signed on m brumars behalf the court granted the requested extension and the government eventually submitted their observation to the court on april m brumar wa replaced from the post of government agent on february on february following an enquiry submitted by the applicant representative about m brumars appointment to the post of government agent the government general secretariat public relation department sent him an email informing him that the manner in which m brumar had been appointed to the post had been unlawful relevant legal framework the relevant provision of the code of conduct for judge and prosecutor a in force at the relevant time read a follows article the judge and prosecutor relation within the group they belong to must be based on respect and goodfaith regardless of their work experience and position the judge and prosecutor were prohibited from expressing their opinion with regard to the moral and professional integrity of their colleague the lawpreliminary remark on february following m brumars removal from the post of government agent the applicant asked the court to hold that all the procedural document submitted by the government in the case were null and void and that the government were estopped from raising any inadmissibility objection because their former agent had not been appointed lawfully she relied on the government general secretariat public relation department email of february confirming the unlawfulness of the appointment in question see paragraph above in addition the applicant argued that the government had submitted several fact concerning the relevant domestic rule and law applicable at the time the applicant had published her article which had been manifestly erroneous and had clearly proved the government intention to mislead the court the court note that according to rule of the rule of court the contracting party are represented by agent who may be assisted by advocate or adviser it note further that none of the information available in the instant case file suggests that an official decision administrative or judicial ha been taken with regard to the alleged unlawful appointment of m brumar to the post of government agent also the government have not informed the court either before or after m brumar wa replaced of a potential impediment to her standing on their behalf moreover the court ha not identified any procedural incident that would have raised doubt about her status a government representative therefore the court see no reason to conclude that the government observation or any other document were not validly submitted a to the applicant allegation that the government have provided erroneous or misleading information the court note that there is no indication in the case file of any intention to mislead the court in the light of the above the court considers that the applicant abovementioned request see paragraph and allegation see paragraph are illfounded and must be rejected alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the measure imposed on her that wa automatically preventing her from taking part in exam that would have furthered her professional advancement and the lack of foreseeability of article of the code in so far a it had failed to define the concept of an opinion expressed on the moral and professional integrity of a colleague had amounted to a breach of her freedom of expression she relied on article of the convention which in so far a relevant read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility submission by the partiesa the government the government argued that the applicant had not suffered any significant disadvantage and had not had any interest in pursuing her application before the court a indicated also by the court of cassations judgment of november the codeofconduct penalty had to be distinguished from the disciplinary penalty because they were covered by different law and had different effect in particular a codeofconduct penalty had not had an automatic effect on a judge option to apply for a promotion even assuming that such a penalty would have made it virtually impossible for an officer of the court to obtain the very good rating which wa needed for his or her promotion application to be validated the applicant allegation that the officer of the court would have been automatically prevented from sitting the actual exam wa unsubstantiated the authority conclusion that the applicant had breached article of the code had not prevented her from applying for and participating in the competition therefore the applicant failure to sit all the actual exam organised during the aforementioned competition raised question a to what interest she could still have in pursuing her application before the court the applicant had not provided any argument and had not shown any action that she had taken that would support her allegation therefore she had been unable to prove any actual damage that she had suffered following the decision of october b the applicant the applicant contested the government submission the applicant contended that the codeofconduct penalty imposed on her could have negative effect on her career indefinitely since she wa already a judge with the court of appeal the only promotion that she could still pursue wa that of judge with the court of cassation however her application for such a competition would be conditional on receiving a very good rating in her last three professional appraisal moreover the decision imposing the codeofconduct penalty had been permanently included in her professional file and would be taken into account every time she applied for a promotion to the court of cassation also her chance of passing the competition organised by the court of cassation in had been rather theoretical even though it wa true that the abovementioned decision had not made it automatically impossible for her to obtain a very good rating in her appraisal the court assessment the court reiterates that it ha considered the rule contained in article b of the convention to consist of three criterion firstly ha the applicant suffered a significant disadvantage secondly doe respect for human right compel the court to examine the case thirdly ha the case been duly considered by a domestic tribunal see smith v the united kingdom dec no march the first question of whether the applicant ha suffered any significant disadvantage represents the main element inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor this first criterion of the rule rest on the premise that a violation of a right however real from a purely legal point of view should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court the assessment of this minimum level is in the nature of thing relative and depends on all the circumstance of the case the severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant subjective perception and what is objectively at stake in a particular case in other word the absence of any significant disadvantage can be based on criterion such a the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant however the applicant subjective perception can not alone suffice to conclude that he or she ha suffered a significant disadvantage the subjective perception must be justified on objective ground see with further reference cp v the united kingdom dec no september a violation of the convention may concern important question of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage regardless of pecuniary interest see margulev v russia no october with further reference the court reiterates the key importance of freedom of expression a one of the precondition for a functioning democracy see appleby and others v the united kingdom no echr vi and margulev cited above in case concerning freedom of expression the application of the admissibility criterion contained in article b of the convention should take due account of the importance of this freedom and be subject to careful scrutiny by the court this scrutiny should encompass among other thing such element a contribution to a debate of general interest and whether a case involves the press or other news medium see with further reference sylka v poland dec no june in the instant case the court note that the applicant subjective perception of the alleged violation wa that it ha affected her prospect of career advancement and had penalised her for participating in a debate of general interest concerning ultimately the reform and the functioning of the justice system see paragraph above and below seen in the context of the essential role a functioning justice system ha in ensuring the proper functioning of any democratic society see among other authority narodni list dd v croatia no november the alleged violation of article of the convention in the present case concern in the court view important question of principle moreover the government have not contested the applicant assertion that the penalty imposed on her had been permanently recorded in her professional file and that it would be an element taken into account if she applied for a promotion to the court of cassation the court is thus satisfied that the applicant suffered a significant disadvantage a a result of the codeofconduct proceeding opened against her regardless of whether her pecuniary interest were actually affected or not and doe not deem it necessary to consider whether respect for human right compels it to examine the case or whether it ha been duly considered by a domestic tribunal see mutatis mutandis margulev cited above accordingly the court dismisses the government objection regarding the alleged lack of a significant disadvantage within the meaning of article b of the convention the court note that the complaint is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merit submission by the partiesa the applicant the applicant contended that even though over time many officer of the court had publicly criticised other such official only the applicant and judge gb had been found guilty by the sjcsm of breaching article of the code both judge had publicly criticised lds when she had been the president of the court of cassation however the sjcsms decision concerning judge gb had been overturned by the court following the court of cassations judgment of april thus the applicant had remained the only judge found guilty of breaching article of the code and would remain the only judge punished for breaching that article because the article wa no longer in force the codeofconduct penalty imposed on the applicant had been an interference with her right to freedom of expression a proven also by the court of cassations judgment of april the interference with the applicant right had not been provided for by law because article of the code had been unclear and unforeseeable this judgment had had an erga omnes effect also even assuming that the interference had pursued a legitimate aim it had not been necessary in a democratic society had not been required by a pressing social need had not been proportionate and the reason provided for it had been unconvincing and subjective the article published by the applicant had been essentially a literary text which had portrayed mainly her feeling a a child during the communist regime the applicant value judgment concerning the activity of the public prosecutor during the communist period had had a solid factual basis specifically the historical truth and the relevant legislation at that time her article had been part of a larger debate in romanian society concerning the prosecutor role in the totalitarian regime it had been published one day after the court of cassation at a hearing presided by lds had asked the constitutional court to examine the unconstitutionality of a law enacted by parliament concerning the lustration of the prosecution service also the article had concerned a debate of general interest specifically around the suitability of a former communist prosecutor to lead a pro european reform process of the justice system a president of the highest court in the country it had not concerned lds in her capacity of judge but in her capacity a president of the highest court the article had contained factual information namely that lds had worked a prosecutor during the communist regime the applicant had not accused the president of the court of cassation of having committed unlawful act in her capacity a a prosecutor but had only wondered whether lds had committed such act and whether a a member of an oppressive communist establishment she had been apt to represent the romanian justice system the applicant had stated that lds had applied the legislation in force during the communist regime which it wa a notorious historical fact had breached human right the applicant had never stated that lds had breached the law the language of the applicant article had not been violent or defamatory it had contained rhetorical question and no accusation and had concerned a person that had not been immune to criticism and for whom the level of acceptable criticism had been higher than for an ordinary judge the expression comrade prosecutor had been inspired by the relevant legislation in force at the time of the communist regime when the use of the word comrade had been mandatory the applicant argued that even though she had been able to apply for the court of cassation competition any new element that would have appeared during that competition would have affected it outcome she had realised during the competition that her application would certainly be invalidated for reason which had included the conclusion of the ijs report of april relying exclusively on the measure taken against her in the latter report had been the main point of discussion during an oral exam assessing the candidate integrity and conduct the applicant wa required to take part in to avoid public humiliation she had decided to withdraw from the competition however in all future court of cassation competition a candidate integrity wa assessed by taking into account all the ijs report produced during past competition which in her case would include the reportb the government the government argued that even though the applicant had not been a journalist she had decided to publish the article on a website specialising in judicial matter and the article had been subsequently reproduced by ordinary newspaper they acknowledged that the sjcsm decision of october which wa subsequently confirmed by the court of cassations judgment of november could be viewed a an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression however the interference had been provided for by law had pursued a legitimate aim and had been necessary in a democratic society the relevant rule concerning the organisation and function of the csm a well a article of the code had been accessible and foreseeable to the applicant and therefore she would have been able to adjust her conduct accordingly it could not be argued that article of the code had been unclear to the point where the applicant could not have expected a codeofconduct investigation being opened against her even though concise the article in question had been clear that officer of the court had to refrain from expressing opinion that could have raised doubt about a colleague professional and moral integrity it had been sufficient to know the definition of the word integrity in order to be able to comprehend the meaning of the impugned article it did not seem that the applicant had contested the lawfulness and foreseeability of article of the code in her appeal against the decision of october or had asked for the impugned article to be struck down her argument concerned rather the absence of the element of the offence regulated by the aforementioned article the csm had examined several alleged breach of article of the code also the court of cassations judgment of april given in the context of proceeding brought by another judge had only held that the word colleague had lacked clarity and precision within the meaning of article of the code the aforementioned judgment had not questioned the need to have in place legal provision which punished opinion expressed by officer of the court on the professionalism and integrity of other judge or prosecutor in addition the court caselaw had not prohibited the national authority from limiting a judge or prosecutor freedom of expression the government argued that in the applicant case the domestic authority had acted within their discretion the issue raised in the present case wa the lack of foreseeability of the code in so far a it had failed to define the concept of an opinion expressed on the moral and professional integrity of a colleague however the court of cassations judgment of april had focused on the meaning of the concept of a prosecutor or judge colleague and not on the question of the concept of opinion expressed on the moral and professional integrity of a colleague the measure taken against the applicant had sought to protect the right and reputation of others a well a the prestige of the justice system the domestic court had struck a fair balance between the competing interest at stake and had justly concluded that the applicant statement had overstepped the limit of acceptable criticism in respect of a person who at that time had held the highest position in the justice system the applicant had accused lds of having taken advantage of an abusive and undemocratic system where the prosecutor had been untouchable in a language which even though phrased in the form of rhetorical question had gone beyond simple satire or speculation she had portrayed lds a a young comrade prosecutor rising working in the service of a system promoting social injustice until she had been appointed to lead the highest court in the country even though the applicant statement could be considered to have been made within the framework of a debate of general interest and to concern a subject of general interest namely the justice system her freedom of expression had not been absolute she had been bound to act in good faith and to provide credible and accurate information a in other similar case examined by the court the applicant article had contained factual allegation which had not been confirmed by a sufficient factual basis the applicant statement had been made with the intention to cast doubt on ldss honesty and reputation she had never openly denied that her statement had concerned lds or claimed that her statement had been taken out of context or misinterpreted she had never retracted or limited the scope of her statement in a manner that would have convinced the court to deliver a judgment favourable to her the government contended that the applicant had not been prevented from applying to participate in the court of cassation competition by the fact that she had breached article of the code also in it report of april the ij had reached it conclusion concerning the applicant by relying not only on the fact that she had breached article of the code a suggested by the applicant but also on the fact that she had committed a disciplinary offence in and had been punished for it according to the information provided by the relevant domestic authority it wa the aforementioned disciplinary punishment and not the fact that she had breached article of the code that currently prevented the applicant from applying to participate in promotion competition to the court of cassation unlike in other similar case examined by the court the applicant in her article had not touched on question concerning the commission of an offence by another officer of the court an element which could have been considered to warrant on it own the interest of the public but had tried merely to associate a judge career with the communist regime in full knowledge of the negative connotation prompted by such an association also the byline of the article included the applicant full name and her position of judge even though she had alleged that the article had only been a recount of her childhood memory and not of aspect connected to her professional life by signing off on the article in this manner the applicant had accepted that the argument exposed in her article would gain a certain weight in the eye of reader given that statement made about a system by a person working within the system were always perceived to be more accurate the authority had not imposed a disciplinary penalty on the applicant nor wa the codeofconduct penalty imposed on her severe excessive or disproportionate in addition the applicant article had not contained any general criticism concerning the functioning of the justice system and had not presented any information about a judge or prosecutor which had been based on her direct personal experience the court assessmenta whether there wa an interference the court note that the party agreed that the sjcsms decision of october which wa subsequently confirmed by the court of cassations final judgment of november amounted to an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the convention see paragraph and above the court see no reason to hold otherwiseb whether the interference wa prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim according to the government the interference complained of wa provided for by law in particular article of the code which wa accessible foreseeable and sufficiently clear moreover the interference complained of pursued a legitimate aim namely that of protecting the right and reputation of others a well a the prestige of the justice system see paragraph and above the applicant did not seem to contest that article of the code had been accessible but she argued that it had lacked sufficient precision and foreseeability she seemed to be prepared to accept though that the interference had pursued a legitimate aim see paragraph and above the court note that in the present case the interference wa based on article of the code a in force at the relevant time and that this provision wa accessible the party view however diverge a far a the precision and foreseeability of the said provision are concerned the court must thus examine whether the provision in question fulfilled the precision and foreseeability requirement the court reiterates that a norm can not be regarded a law unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the individual to regulate his or her conduct he or she must be able if need be with appropriate advice to foresee to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstance the consequence which a given action may entail those consequence need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty experience show this to be unattainable whilst certainty is highly desirable it may entail excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstance accordingly many law are inevitably couched in term which to a greater or lesser extent are vague and whose interpretation and application are a question of practice see sunday time v the united kingdom no april series a no perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extract and karapetyan and others v armenia no november the scope of the notion of foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the text in issue the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed chauvy and others v france no echr vi a concern the provision in question at the relevant time the court find no ambiguity in the content of article of the code it provides that judge were prohibited from expressing an opinion with regard to the moral and professional integrity of their colleague it is true that the impugned article did not define precisely the concept of opinion expressed on the moral and professional integrity and colleague however the court note that the sjcsm the csm plenary and the court of cassation have regarded the point made by the applicant in her article a falling within the concept of opinion expressed on the moral and professional integrity which doe not appear to be an arbitrary or unpredictable interpretation likewise they considered implicitly that the concept of colleague included judge who worked in other court than the one the applicant wa working for see paragraph above the approach of the authority in the applicant case appears to have been consistent at least in so far a the interpretation of the concept of colleague wa concerned with the approach the same authority had in regard to judge gb when they imposed a final codeofconduct penalty on the aforementioned judge see paragraph above in any event the court note that in the codeofconduct proceeding the applicant had not raised any argument regarding the alleged lack of precision of the term colleague used in article of the code it is true that in april the court of cassation eventually found during administrative proceeding brought by judge gb against the csm that the concept of colleague wa not defined with sufficient precision a it could either mean a colleague working in the same court or one who wa working in any other court and therefore considered the impugned legal provision wa unclear see paragraph above however the court ha repeatedly held that the mere fact that a legal provision is capable of more than one construction doe not necessarily mean that it doe not meet the requirement of foreseeability see perinçek cited above moreover the court of cassations judgment wa delivered year after the applicant had published her article or the codeofconduct proceeding against her had ended with a final court judgment the applicant pointed out that there had been very few case in which article had been applied however even assuming that at the time when the applicant published her article there wa no caselaw concerning the interpretation of article of the code this would not render the domestic authority application of that provision unpredictable or arbitrary compare satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june the court considers that the possibility that a codeofconduct penalty could be imposed on her on the basis of the concept of opinion expressed on the moral and professional integrity of a colleague must have been foreseeable for the applicant the impugned legal provision wa enacted to cover the conduct of judge who formed a specific and restricted group more specifically opinion expressed by them about the integrity of other colleague at the time of the impugned event the legal provision in question had been in force for several year and the applicant who wa a professional judge and who had extensive experience in the field could not claim to be ignorant of it content a a result had she had doubt about the exact scope of the provision in question she could have refrained from publishing the article see mutatis mutandis karapetyan and others cited above it seems that she ha not pursued the aforementioned avenue in the light of the above the court is of the opinion that article of the code wa formulated sufficiently clearly in order to fulfil the requirement of precision and foreseeability under article of the convention the court therefore concludes that the impugned interference wa prescribed by law in addition it accepts that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the right and reputation of others and of maintaining the authority of the judiciary within the meaning of article see paragraph above what remains to be determined therefore is whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic societyc whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society the court reiterates the general principle set out in it caselaw concerning the necessity of an interference with freedom of expression the maintenance of the authority of the judiciary and the freedom of expression of judge see morice v france gc no echr and baka v hungary gc no june turning to the present case the court note that the applicant published the impugned article under her own name with her title a a judge attached to the bucharest court of appeal alongside it see paragraph above therefore in examining the interference in question the court will attach particular importance to the position held by the applicant her statement and the context in which they were made see di giovanni v italy no july and baka cited above the court note further that the ultimate aim of the applicant article wa to raise question about the role public prosecutor had had during the communist regime and about the aptness of a person who had occupied such a position for reforming a modern justice system and ensuring it proper functioning it appears that the applicant wrote the article in the context of a larger public debate about legislation concerning the lustration of the prosecution service see paragraph and above and she focused her attention on the career of the president of the court of cassation at the time when she published her article namely judge lds who had worked a a prosecutor during communism the applicant article did not concern judge ldss private life but rather her professional activity and rise to the highest judicial position in the country see paragraph above in these circumstance the court take the view that the applicant article concerned matter of general interest regarding the functioning and the reform of the justice system see morice cited above the court also note that the applicant article concerned the professional activity of an officer of the court who may a such be subject to personal criticism within the permissible limit and not only in a theoretical and general manner see morice cited above and may be subject to wider limit of acceptable criticism than ordinary citizen when acting in his or her official capacity ibid that wa especially true when the judge or prosecutor in question wa like in the instant case occupying a very visible public office namely that of president of the court of cassation bearing in mind the applicant position a a judge the court reiterates that it can be expected of public official serving in the judiciary that they should show restraint in exercising their freedom of expression in all case where the authority and impartiality of the judiciary are likely to be called in question baka cited above the judicial authority are required to exercise maximum discretion and that discretion should dissuade them from making use of the press even when provoked it is the higher demand of justice and the elevated nature of judicial office which impose that duty see di giovanni cited above with further reference it is important for the judiciary to enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out it duty ibid a to the content of the impugned article the court note that the national authority held that the applicant had breached article of the code because of the intended meaning of her article and the expression used in that article such a comrade prosecutor the president of all judge untouchable rising to root out the enemy of the socialist order and for the pursuit of the new man convict woman for abortion all these comrade usurper of christ and his law sternly guarded the communist prison and ha accomplished so much a to become the president of all judge herself in addition they were of the view that her article had breached her duty of discretion moderation and restraint in presenting her opinion had put in doubt the moral and professional integrity of a fellow judge and that her statement had not been value judgment but conveyed specific aspect and a clear and unequivocal personal opinion concerning the moral and professional integrity of the president of the court of cassation they considered that the article may have caused a reasonable observer to doubt the moral and professional integrity of the person targeted by it had been detrimental to the reputation of the justice system and had tarnished the dignity of the position of judge and the independence and impartiality of the judiciary furthermore the applicant had not presented supporting evidence for her allegation see paragraph above the court note that the national authority are in principle better placed than an international court to ass the intention behind impugned phrase and statement and in particular to judge how the general public would interpret and react to them see mutatis mutandis concerning a complaint under article of the convention about an alleged breach of the right to reputation jalbă v romania no february having regard to the balancing exercise carried out by the national authority and the reason advanced by them for their finding the court see no reason to call their conclusion into question the court note in this connection that the applicant article wa mainly worded in the form of an account of her personal experience during communism which did not concern lds directly and which included statement about activity carried out by prosecutor a category to which judge lds had belonged at the time a well a rhetorical question concerning her professional activity and rise taking into account the overall tone and wording of the applicant article a well a the scope of the question raised by her throughout the court agrees with the domestic authority assessment that the article actually contained allegation of specific conduct by prosecutor in general and lds in particular specifically using the case file a weapon to root out the enemy of the socialist order and for the pursuit of the new man hunting down woman who had been forced to abort their child usurping christ and his law and guarding sternly the communist prison detrimental to the remaining member of society her article therefore suggested to the public that lds had behaved in an immoral and unlawful manner and wa likely to lead it to believe that the act constituting the conduct of which lds wa accused by the applicant were established and incontrovertible fact the court note however that none of the information relied on by the applicant in her submission including the historical truth the relevant legislation at that time and the notoriety of the fact that the legislation in force during the communist regime had breached human right see paragraph and above appears to support the suggestion that lds had committed any act of the nature imputed by the applicant either at the time when she had been working a prosecutor or after she had become a judge also it would appear that the legislation concerning the lustration of the prosecution service wa declared unconstitutional by the constitutional court see paragraph above under these circumstance the court is satisfied that the reason given by the national authority and the domestic court in carrying out a balancing exercise between the competing right at stake were relevant or sufficient given the absence of a sufficiently accurate factual basis for the applicant statement the court agrees with the national authority finding that in that context and a a judge the applicant should have been aware and mindful of the risk involved in publishing her article and the impact it could have had see paragraph and above both on judge ldss professional life and on the authority of the judiciary what remains to be examined is the proportionality of the penalty a to the consequence of the codeofconduct proceeding for the applicant the court note that it did not entail any concrete and imminent loss of judicial office or any pecuniary penalty for her it is true that the government have not disputed that the decision in the codeofconduct proceeding wa permanently included in her professional file and would be taken into account in her professional appraisal for which seems to be still pending also during the competition for promotion to the court of cassation the ij relied on the aforementioned decision when it produced it negative report concerning the applicant professional integrity which suggests that the impugned penalty wa relevant and affected the assessment of the applicant application for promotion see paragraph above the court note however that the ij did not take into account only the codeofconduct penalty when it produced it negative report of april concerning the applicant see paragraph above also the applicant ha accepted that the penalty in question taken on it own would not automatically prevent her from applying for a promotion to the court of cassation in the foreseeable future see paragraph above moreover it doe not seem that the applicant wa prevented by the penalty either from applying to participate or from actually participating in the promotion competition see paragraph above but she nevertheless decided to withdraw the court take note of the reason put forth by the applicant for her decision to withdraw from the competition see paragraph above given the finding above the court is not however prepared to speculate on the possible outcome of this or any future competition or whether the decision finding that the applicant had breached article of the code would result on it own in her automatic disqualification or dismissal from competition reiterating it view on the chilling effect that a fear of sanction may have on the exercise of freedom of expression see for instance wille v liechtenstein gc no echr vii nikula v finland no echr ii and elci and others v turkey no and november the court is of the view that even if the decision taken in the codeofconduct proceeding may have had a certain chilling effect on the exercise of the applicant freedom of expression the decision wa not excessive in the circumstance of the present case see mutatis mutandis antonescu v romania no february and di giovanni cited above in the light of the foregoing and the particular importance it attache to the position held by the applicant the court considers that the domestic authority struck a fair balance between the need to protect the authority of the judiciary and the reputation or right of others on the one hand and the need to protect the applicant right to freedom of expression on the other the interference wa thus necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention the court finding is without prejudice to the applicant decision to pursue to the end the administrative proceeding she had initiated against the csm seeking to have article of the code struck down see paragraph above if successful given judge gb experience with similar proceeding and above it seems that they could give the applicant the opportunity to have the penalty imposed on her annulled and removed from her professional file there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention other alleged violation of the convention relying on article of the convention taken jointly with article and on article of protocol no to the convention the applicant complained that she had been discriminated against by the relevant authority because a an ordinary judge she had been punished for her statement which had not been serious while the head prosecutor of the national anticorruption department had not been punished at all for violent and defamatory statement concerning the activity of several magistrate that he had identified expressly or who had been easily identifiable the court ha examined the complaint a submitted by the applicant however having regard to all the material in it possession and in so far a it fall within it jurisdiction the court find that it doe not disclose any appearance of a violation of the right and freedom set out in the convention or it protocol it follows that this part of the application must be rejected a being manifestly illfounded pursuant to article and of the convention for these reason the court unanimouslydeclares the complaint under article of the convention concerning the alleged breach of the applicant right to freedom of expression admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on december pursuant to rule and of the rule of courtsignature_p_

applicant company submitted a copy of an email of a journalist who attended the hearing confirming the alleged statement of the presiding judge the government contested the applicant company assertion that the presiding judge had threatened not only to bar journalist from taking photograph during the proceeding against the defendant but also from future proceeding before the potsdam regional court the government submitted that according to the presiding judge no such statement had been made s repeated his confession on the first day of the hearing by a letter of january the second applicant company asked the president of the regional court to change the presiding judge oral order it pointed out inter alia that several unpixelated picture of s had been published in different newspaper before by a letter of the same date the president replied that he had forwarded the letter to the presiding judge for lack of competence on january the presiding judge supplemented his order and provided his reason in writing the only medium representative who were permitted to take photograph and make videorecordings of s were those who had previously registered with the court and given an assurance that prior to the publication or forwarding of the material the face of s would be disguised by a technical process for example by pixelisation so that it would only be possible to use the image in such a form journalist were barred from further reporting on the case if they failed to comply with the order the presiding judge stated in his reason that he had to balance the public interest in being informed and the personality right of s he acknowledged that the crime at issue wa very different from usual crime and that permitting only picture that disguised s impaired the public ability to be informed however he held that the order wa justified in view of the need to protect the personality right of s he reasoned that it wa unlikely that the case had caused a sensation throughout germany no nationwide television channel besides the second applicant had shown any interest in reporting on it he stressed the importance of the presumption of innocence finding that reporting on s in a way which identified him could have a pillory effect consequently according to the presiding judge the personality right of s who had never been in the public eye or sought to contact the medium and who had expressly requested that his identity be concealed outweighed the public interest in being informed furthermore the order had already proved to be necessary a there had been individual violation of the judge instruction following the first day of the hearing on january the presiding judge sent the supplemented written order to a number of journalist including some who worked for the applicant company on january the applicant company filed an objection gegenvorstellung requesting the suspension of the judicial order banning the publication of image enabling identification during the proceeding against s für die dauer de prozesses gegen s the applicant company stressed the fact that s had confessed to the crime on the first day of the hearing on february the presiding judge upheld the order he held that the implication of the confession and it credibility could only be assessed at the end of the hearing further hearing took place on and january and on february on february the regional court delivered it verdict sentencing the defendant to prison on two count of murder on february the federal constitutional court declined to consider a constitutional complaint by the applicant company without providing reason no bv r ii relevant domestic law and practicea legal provision the court act gerichtsverfassungsgesetz set out provision on reporting on court hearing and on judge power to issue order to ensure their proper conduct the relevant provision read a follows section hearing before the adjudicating court including the

respect of person who are not participant in the hearing shall be made by the presiding judge and in all other case by the court b caselaw of the federal constitutional court the federal constitutional court established in a decision of december no bv r on videorecording in criminal proceeding that based on section of the court act a presiding judge can impose restriction inter alia on the taking of photograph and making videorecordings in doing so the presiding judge ha to balance the public interest in being informed and the personality right of the defendant giving consideration to the circumstance of the case an essential criterion is the gravity of the offence at stake and special circumstance which may cause a rise in public interest it noted that the public interest weighed more when the gravity of the offence clearly differed from act of common criminality that applied even if the defendant had never been in the public eye before a to a defendant personality right account had to be taken of the fact that criminal proceeding caused an unusual and burdensome situation which could not be avoided a attendance at them wa mandatory in particular in respect of defendant a possible pillory effect or implication on the presumption of innocence andor later social rehabilitation had to be considered the federal constitutional court ha decided on several application for interim relief concerning judicial order banning the publication of picture andor photographic journalism in which a defendant could be identified the decision stressed that the presumption of innocence meant that report on criminal proceeding which included photograph had in general to be restrained and at the very least very balanced the nature and gravity of the offence at issue might not only cause a higher level of public interest but also a higher risk of the stigmatisation of the defendant decision of november no bv q a confession by a defendant might impact the balancing process decision of december no bv r a could a possible lack of criminal responsibility due to mental health problem decision of march no bv r in a decision of september the federal constitutional court ha further found that an order to pixelate picture largely respected the public interest in information no bv r iii recommendation by the committee of minister of the council of europe the appendix to the recommendation rec of the committee of minister of the council of europe to member state on the provision of information through the medium in relation to criminal proceeding adopted by the committee of minister on july at the th meeting of the minister deputy contains the following principle of particular interest to the present case principle protection of privacy in the context of ongoing criminal proceeding the provision of information about suspect accused or convicted person or other party to criminal proceeding should respect their right to protection of privacy in accordance with article of the convention particular protection should be given to party who are minor or other vulnerable person a well a to victim to witness and to the family of suspect accused and convicted in all case particular consideration should be given to the harmful effect which the disclosure of information enabling their identification may have on the person referred to in this principle principle live reporting and recording in court room live reporting or recording by the medium in court room should not be possible unless and a far a expressly permitted by law or the competent judicial authority such reporting should be authorised only where it doe not bear a serious risk of undue influence on victim witness party to criminal proceeding jury or judge the law alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant company complained that the judicial order banning the publication of image by which s could be identified had violated their right to freedom of expression a provided in article of the convention which read so far a relevant a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or right of others a admissibility the court observes that the applicant company raised their complaint in substance before the domestic court and that it is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submissionsa the government the government stated that the presiding judge order had been based on section of the court act it had been the presiding judge duty to issue instruction to maintain order at the court hearing which also included ensuring the personality right of s and other party involved article of the convention had not been violated a the presiding judge had maintained a fair balance between the interest affected he had taken account to a sufficient degree of the public interest in being informed and had been entitled to give precedence to the interest of s in view of the circumstance of the case it had been obvious that the report on the proceeding against s had focused primarily on satisfying public demand for sensationalist story about the gruesome detail of the crime the restriction on publishing image of s had been justified s had been utterly unknown to the public he had merited an increased degree of protection against reporting a he suffered from a psychiatric disorder a established by a psychiatric report in october the government emphasised that the picture taken in the courtroom had shown s in handcuff next to police officer or his defence lawyer disseminating picture of that kind where he could be identified would have increased the pressure on him his interest could not be given le weight in view of his confession on the first day of the hearing bearing in mind the importance of the presumption of being innocent until proven guiltyb the applicant company the applicant company argued that the court order had had no legal basis in section of the court act according to the applicant company the domestic court had failed in the present case to recognise the importance of the public interest in being informed and to balance the interest in question properly the very unusual circumstance of the crime at issue had attracted an enormous amount of public interest which had not been limited to mere curiosity but had also involved issue such a the role of the parent of s in the family conflict the domestic court had ignored the fact that s had become known to the public by virtue of the crime he had committed a to the presumption of innocence the domestic court had not paid enough attention to the fact that s had not only made a confession on the first day of the hearing but also previously during the investigation with regard to the presiding judge assumption that s had needed particular protection it had to be noted that the judge had nonetheless not taken any protective procedural measure such a closing the proceeding to the public since the court had ordered that picture of s had to conceal his identity by technical mean the judicial ban had gone considerably beyond the requirement needed for the protection of the presumption of innocence the applicant company highlighted that article of the convention not only protected the substance of information and idea but also the form in which it wa conveyed the court assessment the court note and the party agreed that the judicial order given in the present case had constituted an interference with the applicant company right to freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the convention such interference contravenes the convention if it doe not satisfy the requirement of paragraph of article it therefore fall to be determined whether the interference wa prescribed by law pursued one or more of the legitimate aim in that paragraph and wa necessary in a democratic society for that aim or aimsa prescribed by law the court reiterates that the relevant national law must be formulated with sufficient precision to enable the person concerned if need be with appropriate legal advice to foresee to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstance the consequence which a given action may entail see news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i it ha however acknowledged the fact that frequently law are framed in a manner that is not absolutely precise see satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june and markt intern verlag gmb h and klaus beermann v germany november series a no the court note that the wording of section of the court act lack precision to a certain degree stating that the presiding judge is responsible for maintaining order at hearing thereby giving presiding judge broad discretion the court acknowledges that in light of the varied situation that presiding judge face in proceeding it is impossible to establish precise requirement for the measure to take in order to maintain the proper conduct of hearing in every individual case furthermore in the context of restriction on report using photograph in criminal proceeding the aforementioned provision ha been subject to interpretation by the federal constitutional court which ha elaborated criterion for presiding judge for the balancing of interest see paragraph above the role of adjudication vested in the national court is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubt a may remain satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above accordingly the court is satisfied that the interference wa prescribed by lawb legitimate aim it is not in dispute that the judicial order served to protect the personal right of s in the context of the trial in the course of which he wa to be presumed innocent until proved guilty the court note that the judicial order therefore pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the right of othersc necessary in a democratic societyi general principle the court refers to the general principle set forth in it caselaw for assessing the necessity of an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression which have been recently summarised in bédat v switzerland gc no echr and couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no november the court ha emphasised the essential role played by the press in a democratic society and in particular it duty to impart information and idea on all matter of public interest this duty extends to the reporting and commenting on court proceeding which contribute to their publicity and are thus consonant with the requirement under article of the convention that hearing be public it is inconceivable that there can be no prior or contemporaneous discussion of the subject matter of trial be it in specialised journal in the general press or amongst the public at large not only do the medium have the task of imparting such information and idea the public also ha a right to receive them axel springer ag v germany gc no february furthermore it is not for the court any more than it is for the national court to substitute it own view for those of the press a to what technique of reporting should be adopted in a particular case axel springer ag cited above however the court ha also underlined that the press must not overstep certain bound regarding in particular the protection of the right to privacy of accused person in criminal proceeding and the presumption of innocence bédat cited above egeland and hanseid v norway no april eerikäinen and others v finland no february the fact that everyone charged with a criminal offence ha the right under article of the convention to be presumed innocent until proved guilty is of relevance for the balancing of competing interest which the court must carry out see news verlags gmb h co kg cited above lastly the court reiterates that the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity and scope of any interference in the freedom of expression protected by article of the convention in particular when a balance ha to be struck between conflicting private interest bédat cited above where the national authority have weighed up the interest at stake in compliance with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw strong reason are required if it is to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see mgn limited v the united kingdom no and january axel springer ag cited above where the right to freedom of expression is being balanced against the right to respect for private life the criterion laid down in the court case law have to be taken into account couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above axel springer ag v germany cited above the court considers that the criterion thus defined are not exhaustive and should be transposed and adapted in the light of the particular circumstance of the case compare satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy cited above this applies in particular to case where the presumption of innocence under article of the convention come into play see mutatis mutandis bédat cited above the court ha identified a far a relevant for the present case the following criterion in the context of balancing competing right the contribution to a debate of public interest the degree to which the person affected is known the influence on the criminal proceeding the circumstance in which the photograph were taken the content form and consequence of the publication a well a the severity of the sanction imposedii application to the present caseα the contribution to a debate of public interest the court ha stressed the contribution made by photograph in the press to a debate of general interest news verlags gmb h co kg cited above et seq and eerikäinen and others v finland cited above depending on the degree of notoriety of the person concerned and the nature of the crime the public might have an interest in having someone physical appearance disclosed see mutatis mutandis österreichischer rundfunk v austria no december the court acknowledges that there may be good reason for prohibiting the publication of a suspect image depending on the nature of the offence at issue and the particular circumstance of the case the crime at issue wa brutal but had been committed within a family following a private dispute and in a domestic setting there were no indication that it had gained particular notoriety at the very beginning of the proceeding when the judicial ban wa ordered medium interest in the case had been rather limited a pointed out by the presiding judge and stressed by the government the court agrees with the domestic court assessment that there wa a limited degree of public interest in the case the judicial order at issue did not restrict the content of reporting but concerned the publication of image by which s could be identified therefore the question arising here is whether the publication of such image wa capable of contributing to the public debate on the case the court doe not consider that information on s physical appearance could have contributed significantly to the debate on the case in particular a there wa no notoriety furthermore there is no indication that s physical appearance could have contributed to the assessment of issue such a the role of s parent in the family conflictβ the degree to which the person affected wa known the court note that s wa undoubtedly not a public figure but an ordinary person who wa the subject of criminal proceeding the public became aware of s for the first time a a consequence of the crime he had committed the fact that he wa the subject of criminal proceeding albeit for a very serious offence can not deprive him entirely of the protection of article of the convention bédat cited above and eerikäinen and others cited above the fact that someone picture ha already appeared in an earlier publication might be considered in the balancing process axel springer ag cited above and österreichischer rundfunk cited above and lead to the conclusion that there wa no need to restrict the disclosure of an identity egeland and hanseid cited above the court note that the presiding judge did not take into account previously published photograph of s considering the particular circumstance in which the judge issued the order namely the point in time at the very beginning of the court hearing and the necessary promptness of the decisionmaking process he could not be expected to know of all prior publication at that time and consider them when balancing the competing interest the court observes that s physical appearance wa known to the public a a consequence of the prior publication however most of the picture of s published prior to the criminal proceeding had apparently been taken many year before and showed him at a much younger age in this regard it must also be borne in mind that until then the german press had only occasionally reported on the case with coverage basically limited to local medium a pointed out by the government therefore at the time of the proceeding against him these picture would not have enabled the public to identify s and his identity can not be said to have been already known to the publicγ the influence on the criminal proceeding the court note that s had confessed to the crime twice and that according to the applicant company see paragraph above therefore he would no longer have benefitted from the presumption of innocence however a confession in itself doe not remove the protection of the presumption of innocence according to article of the convention everyone charged with a criminal offence must be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law the court acknowledges that a confession might under certain circumstance have an impact on the balancing of the competing right a the federal constitutional court observed no bv r see paragraph above however in the present case the court is satisfied that the presiding judge took into consideration the fact that s declaration and their credibility had to be assessed at the end of the main hearing according to the domestic law and not before it began this applies all the more a s suffered from a schizoid personality disorder according to a psychiatric expert report obtained by the prosecutor office the criminal court had to review carefully the confession in order to satisfy itself that it wa accurate and reliableδ the circumstance in which the photograph were taken the court ha regard to the fact that image of an accused taken in a court room may show the person in a state of great distress and possibly in a situation of reduced selfcontrol see mutatis mutandis egeland and hanseid cited above the photograph of s taken at the beginning of the hearing showed him in the courtroom in handcuff next to police officer or his defense under these circumstance s had no mean to protect his privacy and to prevent journalist from obtaining image by which he could be identified he did not voluntarily expose himself to the public but wa forced to attend the hearing the court find that under the given circumstance there wa a strong need to protect s privacy the court note moreover that s never sought to contact the medium nor make any public comment quite the reverse he expressly asked to be protected from reporting which identified him s did not consent to the taking of photographsε the content form and consequence of the publication the court order concern the publication of image taken during the hearing by which s could be identified a pointed out by the government disseminating image showing s in the courtroom from which he could be identified would have increased the psychological pressure on him the court note that particular consideration should be given to the harmful effect which the disclosure of information enabling the identification of suspect accused or convicted person or other party to criminal proceeding may have on these person see principle of the appendix to the recommendation rec of the committee of minister of the council of europe see paragraph above likewise it ha to be considered that a publication of image in which a defendant could be identified may have negative implication on a later social rehabilitation if convicted a the federal constitutional court pointed out no bv r see paragraph above in the present case it wa also in the interest of safeguarding due process not to increase the psychological pressure on s in particular in view of his personality disorderζ the scope of the order and the severity of the sanction the material scope of the judicial order wa limited to a ban on the publication of image from which s could be identified a to the temporal scope of the judicial order the applicant company submitted that the presiding judge had stated on january that anyone who failed to comply with his order would no longer have the right to take photograph prior to the commencement of proceeding they had concluded that the threat applied not only to the proceeding in question but had to be considered a a general ban for the future the court is not convinced by the applicant argument that the judicial order could have an effect reaching beyond the firstinstance hearing the reason given in the order explicitly refer to order on reporting on the main hearing anordnung hinsichtlich der bildberichterstattung über die hauptverhandlung in their objection of january see paragraph above the applicant company themselves objected to a ban on reporting enabling identification during the proceeding against s für die dauer de prozesses gegen s in view of the written version of the judicial order of january and given that the presiding judge competence wa limited to the hearing at issue under section of the court act there is no support for the applicant company allegation that the scope of the order went beyond the proceeding against s the court note that the judicial order wa not a particularly severe restriction on reporting the taking of image a such wa not limited the order banned merely the publication of image from which s could be identified any other reporting on the proceeding wa not restricted thus the presiding judge chose the least restrictive of several possible measure in order to safeguard due process and protect s privacy a regard the consequence of a breach of the court order the potential barring from further reporting on the case wa equally limited to the proceeding against s the court doe not consider that the order had a chilling effect on the applicant company contrary to their right under article of the conventionη conclusion the court recognises the careful balancing act carried out by the presiding judge considering the various factor that are relevant under the convention having regard to the criterion and consideration stated above in particular the fact that the case concerned the publication of image taken in a criminal court hearing the court find that the presiding judge clearly addressed the conflict between opposing interest and applied the domestic legal provision by carefully weighing the relevant aspect of the case in view of the margin of appreciation available to the national authority in the context of restriction on reporting on criminal proceeding the court is satisfied that the presiding judge balanced the interest involved in conformity with convention standard the order wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued a the presiding judge chose the least restrictive of several possible measure consequently the court concludes that the interference with the applicant company right to freedom of expression wa necessary in a democratic society accordingly there ha been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the application admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rule of court milan blaško andré potocki deputy registrar president,,,

dealt with proceeding concerning wrongful act committed by the gdr verfahren zur aufarbeitung von ddrunrecht the administrative court dismissed the application for disclosure it reproduced the reasoning of the administrative court of appeal decision of october in it entirety in so far a that court had dismissed the applicant appeal see paragraph above endorsed it and added some consideration a to the balancing exercise it had performed itself a to the first question of the applicant information request the administrative court considered that he wa not entitled to disclosure of the information sought that is to say incriminating finding in respect of the thirteen judge and one public prosecutor who were currently serving in the brandenburg judiciary and for whom there were indication that they had previously collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security firstly while the prerequisite for a request under section of the brandenburg press act see paragraph below were met he could not base a request on that provision because the provision of the stasi record act gesetz über die unterlagen de staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen deutschen demokratischen republik were lex specialis where the disclosure sought concerned record of the state security service of the former gdr first sentence of section and first sentence of section of the stasi record act see paragraph below this conclusion wa confirmed by section of the stasi record act according to which personal information transmitted by the federal commissioner could a a rule only be used for the purpose for which it had been transmitted see paragraph below in the present case this purpose wa assessing whether the individual concerned could be integrated into the brandenburg judiciary there wa no exemption from that rule that would allow disclosure of such information to the press secondly the applicant could not rely on section and of the stasi record act see paragraph below irrespective of whether the requirement of those provision were met a such a request would be directed against the federal commissioner rather than the land of brandenburg thirdly the applicant had failed to prove that he wa entitled to disclosure of the information under the brandenburg information act brandenburgisches akteneinsichts und informationsgesetz see paragraph below or article of the constitution of the land of brandenburg see paragraph below in any event the provision of the stasi record act were also lex specialis in relation to claim under these provision and prevented disclosure fourthly the applicant could not rely on the first sentence of article of the basic law see paragraph below a the right to freedom of information informationsfreiheit only gave a right to obtain information from source that were intended to be generally accessible that wa not the case with regard to the information sought by the applicant in so far a the applicant submitted that the law had changed and file held by the authority were generally accessible following the entry into force of the federal freedom of information act informationsfreiheitsgesetz de bundes the court noted that the scope of the right to freedom of information under the basic law remained unaffected by this development a request based on the federal freedom of information act wa in any event ruled out a the provision of the stasi record act were lex specialis lastly the applicant wa not entitled to disclosure of the requested information based on the freedom of the press guaranteed by the second sentence of article of the basic law which he had not even invoked since the scope of that right did not extend to the opening up of a source of information which wa not generally accessible eröffnung einer informationsquelle a to the first part of the applicant second and third question regarding the name of the judge and public prosecutor the administrative court found that he wa not entitled to disclosure of the requested information either the prerequisite for a request under section of the brandenburg press act were met but the respondent wa entitled to refuse disclosure of the information in accordance with section of that act see paragraph below disclosure of the name would affect the right to protection of personality right allgemeines persönlichkeitsrecht of the individual concerned and their interest outweighed the interest of the applicant a a journalist and the public in disclosure of the name of the judge and public prosecutor for whom there were indication that they had previously collaborated with the ministry of state security of the former gdr despite the significance of the requested disclosure for the work of the press in a democratic society reiterating that there wa no general rule that priority be accorded in the event of a conflict between the aforementioned constitutional right the administrative court considered a regard the interest of the applicant a a journalist and the public in disclosure of the impugned information that a free and independent press wa of particular significance in a democratic society to effectively exercise that role the press had to have in principle unlimited access to information including by obtaining access to source of information that were not generally accessible in order to inform others the medium first had to be informed themselves to that end they needed to have access to the internal working of administration and the process taking place there it wa in general for the press to evaluate and decide what it regarded a being information of public interest making use of the requested information wa the editorial responsibility of the respective medium outlet alone in which context the press could in general be trusted to be aware of it responsibility and to comply with the principle of the press code of conduct and the guideline issued in that regard the mere possibility that a publication would violate personality right wa not sufficient for refusing the disclosure of information to the press it wa evident that there wa a public interest in disclosure of the name of the judge and public prosecutor for whom there were indication that they had previously collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security on the other hand the administrative court considered that disclosure would interfere with the right of the judge and public prosecutor to informational selfdetermination that is to say their authority to themselves decide when and within which boundary fact and circumstance of their personal life were to enter the public domain and would have severe consequence they would be stigmatised their work would be closely watched by the public and there wa a risk that their current and past decision would be subject to public criticism solely because they had previously collaborated with the ministry of state security of the former gdr their reputation could be harmed and they could possibly face hostile behaviour both in their professional and personal life a the matter concerned only fourteen people and the applicant worked a a journalist for a newspaper with a large circulation the potential publication of the individual name could be expected to have a considerable impact moreover even though the individual concerned held particularly important position they had never sought public attention and had kept a low profile since being integrated into the brandenburg judiciary after the reunification of germany the information request did not concern professional conduct in relation to their current function furthermore the potential collaboration with the ministry of state security of the former gdr which the person concerned had not concealed when their application had been assessed had occurred more than twenty year earlier and they had undergone background check by the committee for the selection of judge and public prosecutor these committee had examined application on a casebycase basis assessing the nature and scope of the collaboration with the ministry of state security the severity of the harm that could have been caused the reason for the commencement and discontinuation of the collaboration the age of the person concerned a well a the intended function within the judiciary in accordance with the relevant guideline person whose collaboration with the gdr ministry of state security had exceeded the official duty imposed on them had not been appointed to the brandenburg judiciary whether or not it wa reasonable that an individual be part of public service had been determined based on his or her function within the gdr ministry of state security and his or her conduct after the end of the collaboration in the select case in which judge and public prosecutor had been integrated into the brandenburg judiciary despite indication or evidence of their prior collaboration with the gdr ministry of state security

year earlier placed the land a the employer under an obligation not to disclose their identity at least if there wa no professional misconduct a to the second part of his second and third question regarding where the judge and public prosecutor were serving the administrative court found that the applicant wa not entitled to disclosure of more information than what he had already received it

given the small number of judge and public prosecutor working in certain place this would notably be the case if the public prosecutor were employed at the brandenburg prosecutor general office in view of the information released so far and the wording of the applicant information request the public prosecutor wa male and there were only eight male public prosecutor at that office who could be concerned against this background the applicant wa not entitled to know whether the individual concerned worked at the prosecutor general office or at one of the four public prosecutor office in brandenburg for similar consideration it wa not possible to disclose where the judge concerned were currently serving while ensuring their anonymity if they served at one of the court with a small number of judge it wa likely that they would be identified also bearing in mind additional aspect which could lead to their identification such a their age or whether they had been citizen of the gdr a regard the applicant fourth question a presented to the administrative court at the time of it judgment that is limited to the question of which of the thirteen judge concerned had previously dealt with or were currently dealing with proceeding concerning wrongful act committed by the gdr see paragraph above the administrative court endorsed the reasoning of the administrative court of appeal in

administrative court added that the applicant wa not entitled to receive the requested information under article of the convention either lastly there were no indication that his procedural right including the right to a fair trial had been infringed by the fact that the judge concerned were serving in the brandenburg judiciary contrary to his allegation to that effect on january the applicant lodged a request for leave to appeal by an order of september the berlin brandenburg administrative court of appeal dismissed the applicant request for leave to appeal it rejected his submission

change among judge and public prosecutor personalpolitik im öffentlichen dienst de landes brandenburg am beispiel de personellen umbruchs im bereich der richter und staatsanwälte to the committee of inquiry the report examined the situation of ninetyseven judge and seventyfive public prosecutor who had previously worked in the judiciary of the former gdr and who were still serving in the judiciary of the land of brandenburg at the time the report wa written it concluded that the land of brandenburg had assessed the integration of judge and public prosecutor who had worked in the former gdr into the judiciary of the land of brandenburg on a casebycase basis and that there had been very limited flaw in the procedure ground for excluding an individual integration into the judiciary of the land of brandenburg had been applied in a consistent manner with relevant justification provided in respect of the three case in which deviation had been made it wa ensured that all those who had systemically contributed to the politically motivated caselaw of gdr court were excluded the report described in an anonymised form and by way of example individual case of judge and public prosecutor who had been integrated into the judiciary of the land of brandenburg including excerpt from the file information provided by the federal commissioner minute of interview prior to their appointment decision by the minister and record of the session of the committee for the selection of judge it contained information on the involvement of nine individual with the gdr ministry of state security the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention about the domestic court refusal to order the ministry of justice of the land of brandenburg to provide him with certain information he had requested concerning judge and a public prosecutor for whom there were indication that they had previously collaborated with the ministry of state security of the former gdr article of the convention in so far a relevant read a follows article everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the party submissionsa the government the government submitted that there had been no interference with the applicant right under article of the convention his information request did not satisfy the criterion mentioned in magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no november notably the purpose of the request and the nature of the information sought criterion the domestic authority had already made available most of the information which he had requested including information a to incriminating finding in respect of judge and public prosecutor who had been integrated into the judiciary the number of individual concerned and the court and level of court at which the judge served and the fact that some of them with the specific number being provided had dealt with restitution or rehabilitation proceeding a public debate on the matter wa possible based on that publicly available information the applicant had not indicated why the name of the individual concerned were necessary for his research or of particular interest to the public the government added that the criterion mentioned in magyar helsinki bizottság were not exhaustive all circumstance of a given case had to be taken into account in the present case this included the consequence for the reputation of the individual concerned in the event of disclosure of the requested informationb the applicant the applicant asserted that without being given access to the requested information he a wellknown journalist who had previously published article on german history wa unable to perform his role a a public watchdog he wa prevented from adequately informing the public and contributing to a debate of paramount public interest which involved question a to the integrity of judge and public prosecutor serving in the land of brandenburg and whether they had rendered improper decision when assessing claim by victim of the former gdr concerning restitution rehabilitation and compensation the disclosure of certain information in an anonymised form had not satisfied his information request he needed to know the name of the individual and where they served in order to do research concerning the decision they had taken in particular in proceeding concerning restitution and rehabilitation of victim of the gdr regime the real reason why the authority had not disclosed the requested information wa that they were afraid of a scandal the court assessment article doe not confer on the individual a right of access to information held by a public authority or oblige the government to impart such information to the individual however such a right or obligation may arise where access to the information is instrumental for the individual exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression in particular the freedom to receive and impart information and where it denial constitutes an interference with that right see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above in determining this question the court will be guided by the principle laid down in magyar helsinki bizottság ibid and will ass the case in the light of it particular circumstance and having regard to the following criterion a the purpose of the information request b the nature of the information sought c the role of the applicant and d whether the information wa ready and available the court found that these threshold criterion are cumulative in saure v germany dec no october see also the reference cited there turning to the question whether the applicant had a right of access to information in the present case the court note that his role a a journalist wa undeniably compatible with the scope of the right to solicit disclosure of stateheld information see magyar helsinki bizottság mikiashvili and others v georgia dec no and january and saure no all cited above similarly it is not disputed that the impugned information wa ready and available a regard the purpose of the request criterion and the question whether the nature of the information sought met the publicinterest test the court considers that the outcome of the assessment may vary in respect of the different aspect of information requested by the applicant that being said these criterion are satisfied at least in respect of some part of his information request notably a regard the availability of incriminating finding against the thirteen judge and the public prosecutor for whom there were indication that they had collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security in the past and were currently serving in the brandenburg judiciary the court considers it appropriate to view the applicant information request in it entirety at the admissibility stage and to differentiate between it different part when examining the proportionality of the refusal of the information requested in it assessment of the merit of the case including with respect to the weight attached to the consequence for the reputation of the individual concerned in the event of disclosure of the requested information in sum the court is satisfied that the applicant a journalist wished to exercise the right to impart information on a matter of public interest and sought access to information to that end under article of the convention see also yuriy chumak v ukraine no march and šeks v croatia no february it follows that the government objection a to compatibility ratione materiae with article of the convention must be dismissed the court further observes that the applicant complaint under article of the convention is neither manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention nor inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible merit the party submissionsa the applicant in addition to his argument summarised in paragraph above the applicant asserted that the authority in brandenburg were known for retaining former staff of the gdr ministry of state security in public service the debate about biased judge serving in the brandenburg judiciary had begun right after and continued to the present day press coverage had played a vital part in starting a public debate on the matter his request had sought to find out who had been appointed to post in the judiciary in spite of their involvement with the gdr ministry of state security and what their involvement had been in the absence of an opportunity to verify the information one could only hope that the appointment had been done based on an appropriate balancing of interest he needed to be provided with at least a summary of the incriminating finding contained in the record held by the federal commissioner which wa not excluded by the stasi record act instead a balancing exercise of the competing interest wa called for and the interest of the press in disclosure of that information outweighed that of the individual concerned he could still publish the information in an anonymised form but doing so on a solid factual basis would shape public debate the applicant submitted that the information which had been disclosed in an anonymised form had not satisfied his information request he needed to know the name of the individual and where they served in order to do research concerning the decision they had taken in particular in proceeding concerning restitution and rehabilitation of victim of the gdr regime the authority had a monopoly on the requested information he could not obtain it otherwise in such circumstance access to the information had to be granted to member of the press and withholding such information amounted to an act of censorship the real reason why the authority had not disclosed the requested information wa that they were afraid of a scandal the applicant alleged that the authority had also attempted to hinder the preparation of the study commissioned by the parliamentary committee of inquiry referred to by the government the applicant submitted that he only intended to do research on the matter and that he had not yet decided whether he would eventually publish the name a twostep assessment wa called for firstly whether the information wa to be disclosed to the press and secondly whether the press wa entitled to disclose the information the applicant emphasised that his research and any potential publication would concern the professional life of the individual in the former gdr and in the brandenburg judiciary after german reunification it would not or at least not primarily concern their private life this wa not a case of sensationalist reporting judge and public prosecutor were senior public official who were always exposed to close public scrutiny information on previous collaboration with the gdr state security service did not warrant a particularly high level of protection and the interest of the individual concerned in their reputation wa outweighed by the overriding interest of the press in access to this information of general interest in fact disclosing the information at issue which related to doubt a to the integrity of judge and a public prosecutor would strengthen the authority of the judiciary it had to be borne in mind that the person concerned would never reveal such information by themselves or recuse themselves from proceeding because of their past the requested information wa also ready and available a to the fourth question of his information request the applicant alleged that the domestic court had wrongfully considered the wording proceeding concerning wrongful act committed by the gdr too vague besides various act in the field of criminal law such a abuse of office violent act at the intra german border perversion of justice or illtreatment of prisoner there were for example rehabilitation procedure under administrative law and those relating to professional lifeb the government the government maintained that even assuming that there had been an interference with the applicant article right it had been lawful and the complaint wa hence illfounded they emphasised that the domestic authority had already made available most of the information which the applicant had requested referring to the report presented by professor will to the committee of inquiry of the land parliament they submitted that information a to incriminating finding in respect of judge and public prosecutor who had been integrated into the judiciary wa publicly available that report described in detail in an anonymised form individual case of judge and public prosecutor who had been integrated into the judiciary including excerpt from the file information provided by the federal commissioner minute of interview prior to their appointment decision by the minister and record of the session of the committee for the selection of judge the report thus comprised information on the involvement of the individual concerned with the gdr ministry of state security beyond that the number of individual concerned had been disclosed a had the court and level of jurisdiction at which the judge served and the fact that some of them with the specific number being provided had dealt with restitution or rehabilitation proceeding a public debate on the matter wa possible based on that publicly available information the applicant had not indicated why the name of the individual concerned were necessary for his research or of particular interest to the public it appeared that his intention wa to pillory the individual concerned by publishing their name subjecting them to a blanket suspicion of having improperly exercised their official function and sensationalist reporting that would humiliate them both in a professional and a private context this did not constitute a legitimate or weighty public interest by contrast it could have a severe negative impact on the individual concerned they had a legitimate interest in nondisclosure of this information which wa confidential in nature and had been reviewed when their integration into the judiciary had been assessed they were not public political figure by protecting the reputation of judge the measure complained of also served to maintain the authority of the judiciary the government explained that the legislature had adequately balanced the competing interest of the public in transparency and in coming to term with political and historical circumstance on the one hand with those of rehabilitation and the need of the individual concerned to have their article right protected regarding any potential involvement they may have had in the past with the state security service of the former gdr on the other for that reason disclosure of personal information from the record held by the federal commissioner which wa exclusively regulated by the stasi record act required either the consent of the individual concerned or a balancing exercise in which the right of the press to disclosure and the right to privacy were weighed against each other that act intended to enable victim of the dictatorship to learn whether they had been subjected to any measure of investigation and to assert claim for rehabilitation and compensation another aim of the act wa to enable the authority to vet candidate for public service by checking their background a to any involvement with the ministry of state security the document held by the federal commissioner were not meant to be made accessible to the general public and narrow limit were set a to the right to consult them and to perform background check in view of consideration relating to rehabilitation it wa prohibited to use finding which had been obtained from these record in the context of background check for other purpose the question of whether or not the applicant wa entitled under section of the stasi record act to obtain disclosure of certain information from the federal commissioner wa not relevant in the present case referring to the consideration put forward by the potsdam administrative court in it judgment of december see paragraph above the government asserted that the domestic court had thoroughly balanced the competing interest the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life in accordance with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw and in concluding that certain information wa to be disclosed in an anonymised form and that in respect of certain other information the interest of the individual concerned outweighed those of the public in obtaining the information had not overstepped their margin of appreciation where the balancing exercise had been undertaken by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the court required strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court they referred to von hannover v germany no gc no and echr there were no such strong reason in the present case the thirdparty intervener the centre for democracy and rule of law argued in favour of interpreting article of the convention a a right of the press visàvis the authority to be given access to information within a reasonable time this wa necessary for the press to effectively fulfil it role a a public watchdog in relation to the authority the court assessment having regard to it above finding that the applicant information request viewed a a whole wa compatible ratione materiae with article of the convention see paragraph above the court considers that the domestic authority refusal to provide the impugned information to the applicant interfered with his right under article of the convention such an interference will be justified under article of the convention if it wa prescribed by law pursued one or more legitimate aim set out in that provision and wa necessary in a democratic society the impugned refusal of access to the file wa in accordance with the law namely the first sentence of section and the first sentence of section of the stasi record act a well a section of the brandenburg press act see paragraph and above the court can also accept that the impugned refusal pursued legitimate aim set out in article of the convention namely protecting the reputation of the judge and public prosecutor preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence and maintaining the authority of the judiciary the court ha previously dealt with case in which the denial of an information request pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the right of others see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above et seq and centre for democracy and the rule of law v ukraine no et seq march element which the court considered in the proportionality assessment in those case included i whether the individual concerned by the information request were public figure of particular prominence ii whether they had themselves exposed the impugned information to close public scrutiny iii the degree of potential harm to the individual privacy in the event of disclosure iv the consequence for the effective exercise of the applicant freedom of expression and v whether the applicant had put forward reason for the information request see centre for democracy and the rule of law cited above a well a the degree of public interest in the matter see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above the interest to be balanced against the applicant interest in disclosure of the information are not limited to the right of others see for example šeks v croatia no february and saure v germany no november both of which involved national security concern and include maintaining the authority of the judiciary a set out in paragraph of article lastly the court reiterates that under article of the convention the contracting state enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed under that provision is necessary but that this margin go hand in hand with european supervision see axel springer ag v germany gc no february and magyar helsinki bizottság cited above since the applicant information request concerned different piece of information and that it wa granted to varying degree in respect of it different part the court considers it appropriate to ass the proportionality of the refusal of the different part of the information request separatelya name of the individual concerned and their current place of service the court observes that the domestic authority disclosed that of the thirteen judge concerned nine served in ordinary court four judge were serving in a district court four served in a regional court and one served in a court of appeal four dealt with civil case four dealt with criminal case and one dealt with both civil and criminal matter the remaining four judge served in specialised court of first instance two were serving in administrative court one served in a labour court and one served in a social court see paragraph above at a later stage the authority disclosed that three of the thirteen judge had since retired see paragraph above the administrative court dismissed the applicant information request regarding the disclosure of the name of the judge and public prosecutor a it determined that the individual interest in nondisclosure outweighed the interest of the applicant a a journalist and the public in disclosure in arriving at that conclusion it considered i the role and significance of the press in a democratic society and the importance for member of the press to have access to information for the effective exercise of that role including by way of obtaining the disclosure of information that wa not generally accessible such a the internal working of administration and the process taking place there ii the public interest in the requested information iii that the disclosure concerned fact and circumstance of the personal life of the individual concerned and the severe consequence which the disclosure would have for the individual concerned both in respect of their professional life where there wa a risk that their current or past decision would be subject to public criticism owing solely to their past collaboration with the gdr ministry of state security and in respect of their personal life iv that the individual concerned held important public position but had never sought public attention v that the information request did not concern the professional conduct of the individual concerned in relation to their current function vi that the potential collaboration with the gdr ministry of state security had occurred more than twenty year earlier and the individual concerned had not concealed it when their application for integration into judiciary of the land of brandenburg had been assessed and their collaboration with the gdr ministry of state security had been determined not to have been so severe that it opposed their integration into the brandenburg judiciary and vii that that decision taken by the land of brandenburg more than twenty year earlier placed the land a the employer of the individual concerned under an obligation not to disclose their identity at least if there wa no professional misconduct see paragraph above reiterating that in exercising it supervisory function the court task is not to take the place of the national court but rather to review in the light of the case a a whole whether the decision they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation are compatible with the provision of the convention relied on see von hannover no cited above it considers that the domestic authority examined a considerable number of element when balancing the interest for and against disclosure of the name of the individual concerned compare and contrast centre for democracy and the rule of law cited above and magyar helsinki bizottság cited above the court find that the disclosure of their name would affect the judge and the public prosecutor concerned to such degree a to bring article of the convention into play see axel springer ag cited above it see no reason to depart from the domestic authority consideration in respect of the element examined and considers that they put forward relevant reason for the conclusion that the interest of the individual in nondisclosure of their name outweighed those of the applicant journalist and the public in their disclosure the court moreover observes that a public debate on the matter the fact that thirteen judge and a public prosecutor for whom there were indication that they had collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security served in court in the judiciary of the land of brandenburg wa possible based on the information disclosed by the authority without knowing the name of the individual concerned see also georgian young lawyer association v georgia dec no january last but not least the court concurs with the domestic authority that disclosing the name of the judge and public prosecutor could well result in their judicial decision both past and present being criticised systematically in public noting that the domestic authority established that there were no indication of professional misconduct on the part of the individual concerned a finding which the court is not in a position to challenge such systematic public criticism of judicial decision unrelated to the professional conduct of the judge or the public prosecutor concerned would not only constitute a severe consequence for the professional life of the individual concerned but also for the authority of the judiciary a a whole see morice v france gc no echr these additional consideration weigh in favour of not disclosing the name of the individual concerned and thus reinforce the conclusion reached by the domestic authority in the light of the foregoing the court considers that the reason put forward by the domestic authority were not only relevant but also sufficient to show that the refusal to disclose the name of the judge and public prosecutor wa necessary in a democratic society in refusing the requested disclosure of more detailed information about the place of service of the judge and public prosecutor the administrative court essentially relied on the consideration that the individual could be identified if they happened to work in certain place where there wa a small number of judge and public prosecutor even if the information were disclosed in an anonymised form see paragraph above having regard to the reason advanced by the administrative court in this regard the court see no reason to depart from the finding a to the possibility or likelihood that the individual concerned could be identified if their place of service were disclosed in the event of their identification the above consideration in respect of the refusal to disclose the name of the individual concerned apply it follows that there ha been no violation of article of the convention on account of the domestic authority refusal to disclose the name and place of service of the thirteen judge and the public prosecutor for whom there were indication that they had collaborated with the gdr ministry of state securityb incriminating finding against the judge and public prosecutor the court note that the authority disclosed that nine of the thirteen judge had performed their military service with the felix dzerzhinsky guard regiment affiliated with the ministry of state security while the four others had been secret informant a had the public prosecutor see paragraph above moreover the report commissioned by and presented to the parliamentary committee of inquiry described in an anonymised form and by way of example individual case of judge and public prosecutor who had previously worked in the judiciary of the former gdr and who had been integrated into the judiciary of the land of brandenburg including information on the involvement of some of the individual concerned with the gdr ministry of state security see paragraph above the information thus made available at least to some extent allowed public debate on the matter see also georgian young lawyer association cited above that being said the court note that the report commissioned by and presented to the committee of inquiry concerned first and foremost the procedure for the integration of judge and public prosecutor who had worked in the former gdr into the judiciary of the land of brandenburg and compliance with the relevant criterion it wa thus tailored to provide answer to different question than the applicant information request moreover the report contained information by way of example on the involvement of judge and public prosecutor with the gdr ministry only in relation to a small share of all case reviewed see paragraph above and not necessarily in relation to the individual concerned by the applicant information request seized of the applicant request for disclosure of information on the incriminating finding available against the thirteen judge and one public prosecutor for whom there were indication that they had previously collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security and who at the time of his request were still serving in the brandenburg judiciary the administrative court found that there wa no legal basis to disclose the information sought in arriving at that conclusion the court examined the information request under a number of provision of domestic law a regard some of those it considered that the applicant could not base his request on them because the provision of the stasi record act were lex specialis at the same time a request could not be based on section and of the stasi record act either a such a request would be directed against the federal commissioner rather than the land of brandenburg see also the government submission at paragraph above that it wa not relevant for the present case whether the applicant wa entitled under section of the stasi record act to obtain disclosure of certain information from the federal commissioner it found that the applicant could also not rely on the right to freedom of information under the first sentence of article of the basic law a the information wa not sought from source that were intended to be generally accessible or on the freedom of the press under the second sentence of article of the basic law since the scope of that right did not extend to the opening up of a source of information which wa not generally accessible see paragraph above in a much a the administrative court addressed a considerable number of provision on which an application for disclosure could in certain circumstance be based including some not invoked by the applicant the court can not but note that the administrative court did not engage at all in a balancing of competing interest in respect of this part of the applicant request for disclosure see also magyar helsinki bizottság cited above and and centre for democracy and the rule of law cited above the court is mindful of the government submission that the competing interest had been balanced by the legislature and that in view of consideration relating to rehabilitation it wa prohibited to use finding which had been obtained from the record held by the federal commissioner in the context of background check for other purpose see paragraph above while such consideration pursue the legitimate aim of preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence the court also note that according to the government in administrative practice the stasi record act doe not in general rule out the disclosure of personal information by the body which have requested such information where this concern for example a summary of the content of the record see paragraph above such type of disclosure may under certain circumstance still be covered by the original purpose pursued by the transmission of the record see paragraph above the question whether such disclosure is permissible primarily concern the legal relationship between the requesting body and the person regarding whom a background check wa performed with employer having a duty of care towards their employee see paragraph above the court reiterates that a right of access to information held by a public authority or an obligation on the government to impart such information to the individual may arise under article of the convention where access to information is instrumental for the individual exercise of his or her right to freedom of expression in particular the freedom to receive and impart information and where it denial constitutes an interference with that right see paragraph above and magyar helsinki bizottság cited above such right or obligation may also arise in relation to information that is not and is not intended to be generally accessible see saure no et seq and šeks et seq both cited above in respect of classified information involving national security concern even though the refusal of the requested access did not breach article in the specific circumstance of those case a proportionality assessment taking into account all the relevant element of a given case is required however in the present case the administrative court did not explain why the disclosure of the summary of the content of the record transmitted by the federal commissioner wa excluded in the present case see paragraph and above it did not explain why the disclosure of additional and more detailed information in an anonymised form in respect of the collaboration of the thirteen judge and one public prosecutor with the gdr ministry of state security would necessarily run counter to the duty of care which the brandenburg authority had towards the individual concerned a their employee see paragraph and above in this connection the court considers in particular that the performance of their current function would not be called into question by such anonymised disclosure which did not allow for the identification of the individual concerned at the same time the court considers that there wa a significant public interest in knowing the nature and degree of collaboration by which person still serving a judge and a a public prosecutor in the land of brandenburg at the time of the information request had collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security indeed the nature and degree of that collaboration may have varied considerably and can not be deduced from the information provided that the individual had been secret informant or had served with the felix dzerzhinsky guard regiment see paragraph above the report commissioned by and presented to the committee of inquiry wa tailored to provide answer to different question than the applicant information request and contained by way of example information on the involvement of the individual with the gdr ministry of state security only in relation to a small share of all case reviewed see paragraph and above in the light of the foregoing the court considers that by not examining whether the impugned information could be disclosed in an anonymised form which would have allowed the applicant journalist to contribute on a solid factual basis to a debate on a matter of general interest and by not engaging in a balancing of the competing interest at issue the domestic authority failed to put forward relevant and sufficient reason to show that the refusal to disclose additional information on the incriminating finding against the judge and public prosecutor wa necessary in a democratic society see also magyar helsinki bizottság cited above there ha accordingly been a violation of article of the convention in respect of this part of the applicant information requestc involvement of the judge concerned in certain type of proceeding the court observes the applicant initially requested information on the involvement of the thirteen judge concerned in proceeding concerning wrongful act committed by the gdr andor with restitution proceeding under the property act andor gdr rehabilitation proceeding see paragraph above following the order by the berlin brandenburg court of appeal to disclose certain part of the requested information see paragraph above the brandenburg ministry of justice revealed that six of the thirteen judge had previously been involved in restitution proceeding under the property act or proceeding governed by the criminal rehabilitation act see paragraph above both party subsequently declared part of the matter resolved notably in respect of the applicant question concerning the judge involvement in certain type of proceeding resulting in the discontinuation of the proceeding in this regard see paragraph above the applicant request a presented before the administrative court at the time of it judgment of december read a follows see paragraph aboveiv which of the thirteen judge concerned are currently dealing with or have previously dealt with proceeding concerning wrongful act committed by the gdr verfahren zur aufarbeitung von ddrunrecht it follows that the applicant can not complain before the court in a manner that meet the admissibility criterion about any refusal to provide him with information about the past or present involvement of any of the thirteen judge concerned in restitution proceeding under the property act or in proceeding governed by the criminal rehabilitation act since he himself declared the matter resolved before the administrative court all that he can complain about before the court is the refusal of his information request a presented by him before the administrative court that is which of the thirteen judge concerned wa dealing with proceeding concerning wrongful act committed by the gdr reiterating that applicant are required to substantiate their information request if need be in the course of the domestic proceeding so a to put the domestic authority in a position to engage in the necessary balancing of competing interest see saure no and and contrast centre for democracy and the rule of law both cited above the court can not but note that the berlin brandenburg court of appeal in it decision of october on the applicant request for interim measure found that this request wa too vague a it wa not possible to determine on which type of proceeding the applicant sought to obtain information see paragraph above despite being provided with this judicial guidance that he needed to specify which type of proceeding he wa referring to the applicant did not respond to this call either in his submission before the administrative court in the main proceeding during which he changed the wording of this specific question or in his subsequent submission before the berlin brandenburg court of appeal and the federal constitutional court see saure cited above no and the reference cited therein therefore the administrative court can not be reproached for concluding that this part of request wa too vague a it wa not possible to determine which type of proceeding he meant in this connection the court observes that the applicant provided additional information in his submission before the court a to the type of proceeding he wa referring to see paragraph above there are no indication or submission from the applicant that he wa prevented from making a substantiated submission before the domestic court see saure cited above no it follows that the domestic authority refusal to disclose certain part of the information sought by the applicant in respect of the involvement of the judge concerned in proceeding concerning wrongful act committed by the gdr did not breach article of the convention alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article of the convention about the lack of expedition and the length of the proceeding he further alleged that the domestic court had not been impartial article in so far a relevant read a follows in the determination of his civil right and obligation everyone is entitled to a fair hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law the government submitted that the complaint were inadmissible in so far a he alleged a lack of impartiality on the part of the judge sitting on his case because it could not be ruled out that they had been directly concerned by his information request the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedy a required by article of the convention he had failed to challenge the judge of the potsdam administrative court sitting on his case in the proceeding before that court he had also not alleged a lack of impartiality in his subsequent submission to the administrative court of appeal or challenged the judge of that court in any event none of the judge who had sat on the applicant case could have been concerned by his information request the professional judge who had sat on the case at the administrative court had all been appointed after the reunification of germany they were not originally from the territory of the former gdr and there were no indication that they had collaborated with the ministry of state security none of the judge who had sat on the case at the administrative court of appeal had been serving at first instance on december the applicant allegation that the court in brandenburg had lacked impartiality in general wa an actio popularis and thus incompatible ratione persona with the provision of the convention the government added that the applicant had not complained about the allegedly excessive length or delay before the domestic court and had not made use of the relevant domestic remedy section of the court constitution act in any event the proceeding had not been excessively long the applicant submitted that it could not in theory be excluded that one of the judge concerned by his information request had sat on his case either in the proceeding concerning interim measure which had had a decisive impact on the outcome of the main proceeding or in the main proceeding before the potsdam administrative court a he did not know the name of the thirteen judge concerned or where they served he had been unable to lodge a bias complaint more generally citizen who brought proceeding concerning restitution and rehabilitation and had their claim assessed by judge who had themselves collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security did not have fair hearing before impartial tribunal and were unable to challenge the judge concerned a biased given that they did not know their name moreover the applicant submitted that the length of the proceeding had been excessive and had gradually diminished the value of the requested information he had not been required to make use of section of the court constitution act a that remedy in his submission exclusively concerned compensation not the expedition of pending proceeding a regard the applicant complaint about the length of the proceeding the court considers that even assuming that article of the convention is applicable to the proceeding at issue he ha failed to exhaust domestic remedy a required by article of the convention see saure cited above he did not make use of the remedy provided for by domestic law in that regard section of the court constitution act see paragraph above to complain about the length of the proceeding nor did he raise a complaint of undue delay before the federal administrative court the purpose of which would have been to warn that court and enable it to expedite the proceeding see paragraph above similarly the applicant failed to exhaust domestic remedy a required by article of the convention in so far a he alleged a lack of impartiality on the part of the judge sitting on his case he did not lodge a bias complaint against the judge of the potsdam administrative court who sat on his case which he could have done on the ground that it wa known that four of the judge concerned by his information request were serving at specialised court of first instance including in the administrative court see paragraph above no knowledge of the name of the judge would have been required he also did not allege a lack of impartiality in his subsequent submission to the administrative court of appeal or challenge the judge of that court in this respect the court also take note of the government submission that none of the judge who had sat on the applicant case at the administrative court and at the administrative court of appeal could have been concerned by his information request see paragraph above it follows that the applicant complaint under article of the convention must be rejected in accordance with article and application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court find that there ha been a violation of the convention or the protocol thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party damage the applicant did not submit a claim in respect of pecuniary or nonpecuniary damage the court therefore make no award cost and expense the applicant claimed a total of euro eur in respect of cost and expense comprising eur in court fee and eur in lawyer fee the applicant claimed a further eur for cost and expense incurred in the proceeding before the court comprising eur in lawyer fee and eur for the translation into english of his written observation the applicant submitted invoice in respect of each item claimed the government submitted that the claim for cost and expense wa unjustified the reimbursement of lawyer fee wa ruled out if such fee were borne not by the applicant himself but on his behalf by a third party there wa evidence to suggest that the applicant employer or it holding company had borne the cost of the proceeding without subsequently charging them to the applicant the invoice submitted to the court were not addressed to the applicant but to axel springer se or kh who worked for the applicant employer a inhouse counsel it had to be assumed that the applicant had pursued the proceeding before the domestic court and before this court on behalf of his employer for the purpose of reporting the latter and that all of the cost incurred had been borne by his employer the applicant had not provided any documentation to show that he himself had borne the lawyer fee and the court cost for which he wa seeking reimbursement the government thus disputed that the applicant had incurred any cost at all in the alternative they submitted that the cost and expense claimed were excessive a to quantum adding that the applicant statement in respect of the lawyer fee were incomplete or even false according to the court caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of cost and expense only in so far a it ha been shown that these were actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable a to quantum a representative fee are actually incurred if the applicant ha paid them or is liable to pay them see merabishvili v georgia gc no november in the present case regard being had to the document in it possession and the above criterion the court considers that the applicant ha not provided any evidence that he paid or is liable to pay the cost and expense claimed noting in particular that all the invoice submitted to the court were addressed to the applicant employer the court therefore considers that the applicant ha not actually incurred the cost and expense claimed and reject his claim for these reason the court unanimouslydeclares the complaint concerning article of the convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible hold that there ha been a violation of article of the convention on account of the decision to refuse disclosure of additional information on the incriminating finding available against the thirteen judge and the public prosecutor hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention on account of the refusal to disclose the name and place of service of the thirteen judge and the public prosecutor a well

radio station they referred in particular to msʼs candidacy for that position m wa the entertainment editor at the bd public radio at the material time the relevant part of the letter read a follows we acknowledge and appreciate your support and the effort you put in creating a multiethnic radio unfortunately it appears that there wa a major oversight at the very beginning of this important venture the panel for the selection of the director of the radio wa created in contravention of the statute of brčko district it is composed of three serb member one croat and one bosniac thus yet again the statute which requires proportional representation of the three constituent people in public institution wa disregarded unfortunately nothing ha been done to correct this the unofficial information we received to the effect that m m wa proposed for the position of the radio director by the serb member of the panel although the former director wa bosniac confirms the above this proposal is unacceptable all the more so because it concern a person who lack the professional and moral quality for such a position according to the information we receivedin an interview published in nin discussing the destruction of mosque in brčko m m said that muslim were not people that they did not posse culture and that accordingly destroying mosque could not be seen a a destruction of cultural monument on the radio premise she made a point of removing from the wall and tore to piece the calendar with the schedule of religious service during the month of ramadanon the radio premise she covered the coat of arm of bosnia and herzegovina with the coat of arm of the republika srpskaas the editor of the entertainment programme she banned broadcasting of sevdalinka arguing that that type of song had no cultural or musical value we firmly believe that the abovedescribed act absolutely disqualify m m a a candidate for the position of the director of the multiethnic radio and television of brčko district we hope that you will act accordingly in the absence of any action on your part we will be forced to contact the medium a well a the other competent national and international body shortly thereafter the letter wa published in three different daily newspaper on may m initiated civil defamation proceeding against the applicant and claimed compensation of convertible mark bam m submitted that she had learned about the content of the letter shorlty after it had been sent by the defendant but that she did not know who gave it to the medium after the letter wa published the governor of bd annulled the proceeding for the appointment of a director of the public radio station on september the bd court of first instance the court of first instance rejected the claim it held that the applicant could not be liable for the alleged defamation because they had not published the letter in the medium the relevant part of the judgment read a follows from the defendant letter it is clear that it wa privately sent to the governor to the president of the assembly and to the supervisor for brčko districtand it wa not sent to the medium the aim of the letter wa not dissemination of unverified information to public but bringing the attention of the competent authority to certain issue and to enable them to draw certain conclusion on verification of that information having examined the article published in the medium the court concludes that none of them wa published by the defendant in this case m appealed against that judgment to the bd appellate court the appellate court on may the appellate court quashed the judgment of september and decided to hold a new hearing on july after having examined several witness including the two employee of the bd public radio from whom the applicant received the information presented in their letter the appellate court found that the contested letter contained some valuejudgments but also the statement of fact which had been untrue and damaging to msʼs reputation it held that for the liability for defamation to be established under section of the defamation act it wa irrelevant that the applicant did not publish the letter the appellate court ordered the applicant to inform the international supervisor for bd the president of the assembly of bd and the bd governor about the retraction of their statement within day in default of which they had to pay bam in damage to m together with default interest at the statutory rate from july they were further ordered to publish the judgment at their own expense on november m filed a request for the enforcement of the above judgment to the court of first instance she proposed inter alia that the court send the judgment of july for publication at the applicant expense on december the court of first instance issued a writ of execution on december the applicant paid bam approximately euro eur by way of the enforcement of the judgment of july on march the court of first instance closed the enforcement proceeding in the meantime on october the applicant complained about the violation of their right to freedom of expression to the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina the constitutional court on may the constitutional court held that the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression wa necessary in a democratic society and concluded that there had been no violation of article iih of the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina and article of the convention the relevant part of the decision read a follows at the outset the constitutional court note that the appellant did not deny that their liability for defamation wa based on the defamation act and that therefore the interference with the right to freedom of expression protected by article of the european convention wa prescribed by law the impugned judgment wa delievered in a civil defamation proceeding initiated by the plaintiff against the appellantsaccordingly the interference pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation or right of others what remains to be determined is whether the interference complained of wa necessary in a democratic society the constitutional court considers that the appellate court established without doubt that the impugned factual statement about m were false and that the appellant were liable for defamation from the submission of the two witness from whom the appellant received the information presented in the letter concerning the part of the letter in which it wa stated that m made a point of removing from the wall and tore to piece the calendar with the schedule of religious service during the month of ramadan and a the editor of the entertainment programme she banned broadcasting of sevdalinka arguing that that type of song had no cultural or musical value the appellate court established that there wa an evident inconsistency between that what had been said to the appellant and that what they had reported in the letter furthermore the statement from the impugned letter that m gave an interview concerning the destruction of mosque wa refuted by another witness who submitted that a subsequent verification had revealed that m had not been the author of the said interview finally the appellant failed to prove the veracity of the allegation that m covered the coat of arm of bosnia and herzegovina with the coat of arm of the republika srpska in view of the above the constitutional court considers that in the present case the right of the appellant to report irregularity in the conduct of an official to a body competent to deal with such complaint can not be premised on ascertaining manifestly untrue fact which go beyond the limit of acceptable criticism of civil servant accordingly the court considers that the appellate court correctly concluded that there wa a pressing social need in the present case for the interference with the appellant right to freedom of expression furthermore the constitutional court note that the appellate court awarded nonpecuniary damage to m because her reputation wa affected by the untrue statement made in the impugned letter the constitutional court ha already stated in it previous jurisprudence that a person reputation form part of her personal identity and psychological integrity the appellantsfailed to verify the impugned statement beforehand a wa their duty the appeal court established that the appellant had damaged ms reputation by making untrue allegation which caused her mental anguish when deciding on the claim in respect of nonpecuniary damage and it amount the appellate court took into account the purpose of those damage a well a that it should not favour aspiration that are incompatible with it nature and social purpose the constitutional court considers that a measure imposed on the appellant in the present case wa proportionate to the aim pursued the court further considers that the appellate court did not go beyond it discretionary power in deciding on the claim in respect of nonpecuniary damage the constitutional court find that the reason the appellate court gave were relevant and sufficient within the meaning of article of the european convention in view of the above the constitutional court considers that the interference with the appellant right to freedom of expression wa necessary in a democratic society and that therefore there ha been no violation of article iih of the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina and article of the european convention on september the constitutional court decision wa served on the applicant ii relevant domestic lawa constitution of bosnia and herzegovina the constitution of bosnia and

disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court note that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submissionsa the applicant the applicant maintained that their intention had been to inform those in authority about certain irregularity in a matter of considerable public interest and to prompt them to investigate the allegation made in the letter the letter had been sent privately and it subsequent publication had occurred without their knowledge moreover the letter contained their value judgment concerning ms suitability for the position of a director of the bd public radio station the subject matter of the letter wa of a public interest nature since it concerned the suitability of a candidate for the post of a director of a multiethnic public radio station a well a the selection processb the government the government agreed that there had been an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression but submitted that it had been prescribed by law had pursued a legitimate aim and had been necessary in a democratic society the applicant liability for defamation had been established by the appellate court which had found that their letter contained both opinion value judgment a well a the untrue and damaging factual statement about m who wa a public servant at the material time the applicant had failed to verify these fact before presenting them in the letter the constitutional court upheld those finding moreover considering that the letter wa later published through an unknown source it content wa made available to the general public and the consequence for ms reputation had become even more serious thus it could not be argued that this case wa only about private correspondence between the applicant and the competent authority the government further maintained that it could not be excluded that the applicant had themselves sent the letter to the medium lastly in view of the measure imposed on the applicant for defamation the government concluded that a fair balance wa struck between the applicant right to freedom of expression and ms right under article of the convention the court assessment it is common ground between the party and the court agrees that the decision of the domestic court and the award of damage made against the applicant amounted to interference by a public authority with the applicant right to freedom of expression under the first paragraph of article of the convention it is also undisputed that the interference wa prescribed by law namely section of the defamation act and pursued a legitimate aim that of the protection of ms reputation it follows that the main question to be addressed in the present case is whether the impugned measure wa necessary in a democratic society the test of whether the interference complained of wa necessary in a democratic society requires the court to determine whether it corresponded to a pressing social need whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason given by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in assessing whether such a need exists and what measure should be adopted to deal with it the national authority are left a certain margin of appreciation this power of appreciation is not however unlimited but go hand in hand with european supervision by the court whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article for an analysis of the relevant principle in more detail see among many other authority mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no echr extract the court observes that in the present case the defamation claim wa born out of the applicant private correspondence with the local authority see kazakov v russia no december sofranschi v moldova no december and siryk v ukraine no march in the impugned letter the applicant stated their complaint about m who wa the editor of the entertainment programme at the bd public radio at the material time and one of the candidate for the post of director of that radio station a well a about the selection process they claimed that their intention wa to inform competent authority about certain irregularity in a matter of important public interest and to prompt them to investigate the allegation in the letter while it is true that the impugned statement were subsequently made public the court note that there wa no evidence in the domestic proceeding that the applicant had participated in their publication that wa indeed the point of view of the firstinstance court see paragraph above moreover the appellate court only found the applicant liable for defamation by sending the impugned letter to the authority competent for taking relevant further step into the matter and this wa upheld by the constitutional court the court will therefore refrain from taking into consideration any other alleged mean of defamation of m by the applicant see mutatis mutandis sofranschi cited above the court ha in several case observed that it may be necessary to protect public servant from offensive abusive and defamatory attack which are calculated to affect them in the performance of their duty and to damage public confidence in them and the office they hold see janowski v poland gc no echr i and lešník v slovakia no echr iv the extent to which such protection might be deemed necessary depends on the particular circumstance of the case in the present case the court is ready to accept that a candidate for a position of a director of a public radio may be considered to belong to that category of official the government maintained the same see paragraph above however the court reiterates that a the applicant set out their grievance in correspondence submitted in their private capacity the requirement of protection under article of the convention have to be weighed not in relation to the interest of the freedom of the press or of open discussion of matter of public concern but rather against the applicant right to report irregularity in the conduct of an official to a body competent to deal with such complaint see zakharov v russia no october kazakov cited above and siryk cited above that citizen should be able to notify competent state official about the conduct of civil servant which to them appears irregular or unlawful is one of the precept of the rule of law see zakharov cited above turning to the present case the court note that the applicant letter sent to the highest authority of bd contained factual allegation about ms alleged misconduct a well a some value judgment in it practice the court ha distinguished between statement of fact and value judgment the existence of fact can be demonstrated whereas the truth of value judgment is not susceptible of proof the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article see jerusalem v austria no echr ii however even where a statement amount to a value judgment the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive see de haes and gijsels v belgium no february the court observes that in the present case the domestic court made a distinction between statement of fact and value judgment contrast with sofranschi cited above the appellate court had premised it finding of the applicant liability on inaccuracy of factual statement made in their letter after having heard the witness see paragraph above there is nothing in the casefile to indicate that the applicant did not have an effective opportunity to adduce evidence in support of their allegation and to thereby establish their truthfulness unlike the position in busuioc v moldova no december savitchi v moldova no october and sofranschi cited above the court note that the applicant did not resort in their letter to abusive strong or intemperate language moreover it doe not consider that their complaint wa vexatious or that it constituted a gratuitous personal attack on m however a the domestic court correctly concluded the applicant had acted negligently in reporting ms alleged misconduct it appears that they had simply passed on the information they received without making a reasonable effort to verify it accuracy in addition when the applicant were ordered by the appellate court to inform the international supervisor for bd the president of the assembly of bd and the bd governor about the retraction of their statement they failed to do so see paragraph above in the overall circumstance of the instant case the court find that the solution of the domestic court struck a fair balance between the competing interest of the claimant and those of the applicant and the reason given to justify their decision were relevant and sufficient and met a pressing social need the court also had regard to the award of damage made against the applicant in the context of a civil action and did not find it to be disproportionate therefore the court doe not see any serious reason to substitute it own assessment for that of the constitutional court which examined the question at issue with care and in line with the principle laid down by the court caselaw accordingly there ha been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court declares unanimously the application admissible hold by four vote to three that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on october pursuant to rule and of the rule of court françoise elens passos guido raimondi registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the joint separate opinion of judge nicolaou tsotsoria and vehabović is annexed to this judgment grafep joint dissenting opinion of judge nicolaou tsotsoria and vehabović we regret that we are unable to subscribe to the view of the majority that the appellate court judgment finding the applicant liable for defamation a upheld by the constitutional court wa compatible with article of the convention we are of the opinion that it wa not and that there ha therefore been a violation of the applicant right to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea under that article section of the defamation act of bd defines defamation a causing damage to the reputation of a person by ascertaining or disseminating a falsehood in relation to that person it is of course for the domestic court to interpret legislation but no question arises a to the meaning and effect of the relevant provision in the present case what is at issue is in effect whether the undisputed fact of the case could conceivably afford ground for imputing any liability to the applicant a we understand those fact they clearly do not we note first that it can not be said that the applicant were in the circumstance responsible for disseminating the letter complained of they addressed it to the competent authority that is to say the international supervisor for bd the president of the assembly of bd and the governor of bd it wa a very limited communication which wa both private and confidential and wa made to person who had a direct institutional interest in the matter and were thus entitled to receive it the letter wa certainly not meant for wider publication or in the word of section of the defamation act for dissemination that the applicant reserved the right to contact the medium if no action wa taken by the authority doe not detract from this argument whether such an eventuality would have materialised and if so in what form or with what content one simply doe not know lastly it ha not been suggested that the applicant should be held accountable for the ultimate dissemination of the letter in which they were not shown to have been involved in any way the letter in question concerned in essence the procedure for the appointment of a director of the bd public radio it contained view on matter of public interest it criticised the approach already taken by the authority and transmitted to them unofficial information received in relation to candidate m to the effect that m wa unsuitable for the post the gist of it all wa that the authority were dutybound to direct their attention to the said unofficial information and if it wa substantiated to act accordingly it wa clear that the applicant relied on the authority to inquire into the various allegation and to evaluate them the fact that some of the allegation to which that information referred might have been shown after inquiry to be unfounded or inaccurate could not by itself vitiate the propriety of the applicant communication with the authority what is germane to the present purpose is that the applicant themselves made no definite or final assertion a to the fact in the word of section of the defamation act there wa nothing they did that could fairly be regarded a tantamount to ascertaining a falsehood we would further emphasise that in this type of situation the communication should be seen in context account should be taken of the need to protect the reputation of the individual but also of the need to maintain confidence in public administration by encouraging the involvement of citizen and addressing their concern people are entitled in the discharge of their civic duty to bring relevant information to the attention of the authority and may indeed do so in strong term in an attempt to persuade the authority to scrutinise such information so a to ensure sound administration in public affair a person may sometimes overstep the mark and where that happens a proportionality exercise may be necessary in the present case the highest domestic court approached the case a if the applicant had actually gone farther than they should have done even if that were the case the court then failed in our view to carry out a meaningful examination of the relevant competing interest bearing on the proportionality of state interference with the right to freedom of expression under article the convertible mark us the same

application for the issuance of an interim injunction einstweilige verfügung to that effect arguing that his conviction of twenty year earlier had long been expunged he referred to section of the criminal record deletion act tilgungsgesetz see paragraph below according to which all negative consequence that were connected to that conviction ceased to exist he did not dispute that he had been convicted in under the national socialist prohibition act verbotsgesetz the prohibition act but he had been released on parole in he argued that he had reintegrated in society had founded a family and had taken a regular job he stated that by spending several year in prison he had paid for his action which he had committed during a longclosed phase of his life he had behaved well ever since wa no longer a public figure and wa certainly not a person of interest within the context of the report he did not even know nh overall he did not have to accept the statement that he wa a convicted neo nazi in it submission in reply klagebeantwortung the applicant company argued that the criminal proceeding against h had been subject to countless report by domestic a well a international medium in the s the impugned statement that he wa a convicted neo nazi wa undisputedly true it furthermore submitted that the plaintiff wa one of the most important former austrian neo nazi and that the circumstance that had led to his conviction were of historical importance zeitgeschichtlich bedeutend thus the plaintiff wa an absolute person of contemporary history absolute person der zeitgeschichte furthermore he had not ceased his respective political activity after his release from prison but wa still active in the neo nazi scene by way of proving that statement the applicant company quoted a wikipedia entry about h a well a an article by the documentation archive of the austrian resistance dokumentationsarchiv de oesterreichischen widerstandes according to which the plaintiff h had attended two public event with gk in namely an event in carinthia organised by the freedom party of austria and an event in leipzig organized by die freien kräfte leipzig where both h and gk had allegedly given speech on the prohibition act there wa a public interest in knowing about the political circle in which nh a presidential candidate moved and the impugned report had broached the issue of how the freedom party of austria dealt with rightwing extremism it wa therefore covered by article of the convention h disputed the allegation that he had engaged in any activity in the neo nazi scene after his conviction he argued that the event in carinthia in had served the purpose of commemorating war veteran and had been attended by several member of different political party a regard the event in leipzig in the same year he denied that he had made the comment that had been mentioned in the article quoted by the applicant company he had only expressed his personal experience at an event organised by the national democratic party of germany nationaldemokratische partei deutschland or npd a recognised political party by a decision of august the vienna commercial court handelsgericht wien in provisional proceeding provisorialverfahren dismissed hs application for the issuance of an interim injunction the court essentially argued that the public interest in receiving information on nh circle including his staff member and the interest of the applicant company in publication outweighed the interest of h in the observance of confidentiality moreover the assertion made in the article in respect of h namely that he wa a convicted neo nazi wa true by a decision of september the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht wien dismissed an appeal lodged by h essentially endorsing the reasoning of the lower court however following a further appeal by h the supreme court oberster gerichtshof in a decision of january case no ob g prohibited the applicant company from publishing picture of h without his consent if at the same time he is called a convicted neo nazi in the accompanying report andor statement of equivalent meaning are made about him there and gave the following reasoning the supreme court ha already approved in case no ob s see paragraph below in respect of another company which is also a part of the defendant medium company the prohibition of the publication of the plaintiff hs image without his consent if the accompanying text describes him a a neo nazi leader and doe not state at the same time that he ha already served his prison sentence and ha behaved well since in the case at hand the defendant published an article in it periodical publication österreich on july in which the claimant h is referred to a a convicted neo nazi a photograph accompanying this article show the claimant next to the convicted gk among other person this court can not uphold the lowerinstance judgment holding that decision no ob s had been complied with despite the fact that the plaintiff wa described in the article a a convicted neo nazi but at the same time in the accompanying text it wa stated that the neo nazi meeting depicted in the picture had taken place in the supreme court ha clarified that any balancing of interest performed when assessing the legality of photojournalistic coverage concerning a convicted person after his or her release on parole must consider among other thing the connection between the content of the report in question and the accompanying picture a well a the completeness and correctness of the accompanying text decision no ob t the content of the article impugned in this case however are not concerned with the claimant but with his brother and with a candidate for the election of the federal president therefore there wa no objective justification at all for the reference to the previous conviction of the claimant a a neo nazi subsequently in the main proceeding the vienna commercial court by judgment of april ordered the applicant company to refrain from now on from publishing picture of h without his consent if at the same time he is called a convicted neo nazi in the accompanying report andor statement of equivalent meaning are made about him therein at the same time it dismissed the claim lodged by h for euro eur plus interest and cost by way of compensation for nonpecuniary damage and ordered the applicant company to reimburse h for the cost of the proceeding in it reasoning the court essentially noted referring to the reasoning of the supreme court in the provisional proceeding see paragraph above that a balancing of the clearly infringed interest of the claimant against the public interest in the publication that gave rise to the instant proceeding apparently doe not have to be carried out the claim lodged by h for compensation for nonpecuniary damage had to be dismissed given the fact that a particular injury that is to say an injury exceeding the usual measure über da übliche maß hinausgehende kränkung could not have occurred for the very reason that the fact in question are indisputably true the vienna court of appeal did not grant the related appeal lodged by the applicant company dismissing it by a judgment of september it essentially stated that according to the legal view held by the supreme court there had been no objective justification for the reference to the conviction of the claimant a a neo nazi in the impugned article because the content of the article had not concerned the claimant but his brother and a candidate in the election for the federal president therefore it wa unnecessary to balance the individual interest of the claimant against the public interest in being informed about the political environment in which the office manager of the presidential candidate moved it ordered the applicant company to reimburse h for the cost of the proceeding by a decision of december case no ob s the supreme court rejected an extraordinary appeal on point of law lodged by the applicant company it referred to it reasoning in the provisional proceeding see paragraph above and added citing the case of österreichischer rundfunk v austria no december that there wa no temporal connection between the photograph taken in hs criminal conviction in and the applicant company calling him a convicted neo nazi in the impugned article of relevant domestic legal framework and practice section of the copyright act urheberrechtsgesetz prohibits any public exhibition andor dissemination of image where the legitimate interest of the person in question would be violated it read a follows in it relevant part protection of one image section image of person shall neither be exhibited publicly nor disseminated in any other manner by which they are made accessible to the public where the legitimate interest of the person in question or in the event that they have died without having authorised or ordered publication of a close relative would be injured in assessing whether legitimate interest are violated not only the picture alone ha to be considered but also the accompanying text in it overall context see supreme court case no ob t and no ob w in it decision of october case no ob s see paragraph above regarding a different article published by the applicant company that had contained a photograph of h with the accompanying caption neo nazi leader the supreme court held that the picture a such wa connected with event of contemporary historical significance however the publication of photograph that together with the accompanying text recalled crime committed long ago by the person depicted would generally disproportionately impair his or her advancement owing to the pillorying effect prangerwirkung that would arise therefrom according to the supreme court this applied all the more if the person concerned in the instant case h in had already served his or her prison sentence and had been socially reintegrated for year and for those reason had a legitimate interest in the public not being reminded of his or her past the supreme court found that the lower court had taken into account the public interest in the publication of the photograph a they had not generally prohibited it a legitimate interest in such publication could not however justify creating the incorrect impression that h who had been fully rehabilitated and wa not any longer in the public eye wa still active a a neo nazi leader starting with it judgment of september case no ob the supreme court ha consistently held that section of the copyright act ha to be interpreted in the light of section a of the medium act mediengesetz this provision specifies in which case the publication of image of victim suspect or offender is to be permitted by giving detail of the criterion for the balancing of interest to be performed accordingly the austrian court have to ass by way of a first step whether there is a public interest in publication and which legitimate interest of the person concerned run counter to publication subsequently the legitimate interest of the person concerned must be balanced against the public interest if any in the publication of that person image publication is permitted only if the public interest in publication is the overriding interest such overriding public interest in publication may exist for instance on account of the person position in society or of some other connection of that person with public life section a of the medium act provides that the legitimate interest of the person concerned will in any event be harmed if the publication of an article or photograph may disproportionately prejudice the advancement of the person concerned section to of the criminal record deletion act tilgungsgesetz read a follows in their relevant part expunging of criminal conviction section save for case where it is excluded

adjourned in such a way that the target of the accusation is identifiable by a third person is liable to imprisonment for up to three month or a fine not exceeding one hundred and eighty dayfines the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant company complained that the domestic court decision had violated it right to freedom of expression a provided in article of the convention which in so far a relevant read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the court note that the application is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merit the party submissionsa the applicant company the applicant company submitted that the public interest in being informed of the nature of the political milieu of the office manager of the presidential candidate nh prevailed in the instant case that milieu included the most prominent austrian former neo nazi gk and his former deputy h the fact that the office manager of the presidential candidate had attended a public protest wielding a baton alongside those two subsequently convicted neo nazi bore witness to the political environment that surrounded nh himself the applicant company argued that this spoke volume a to the way in which the freedom party of austria and nh who had at the time also been the third president of the austrian national assembly nationalrat dealt with rightwing extremism such information wa very valuable and could only be proved by publishing the photograph of and referring to hs conviction turning to the criterion established in the court caselaw regarding the balancing of respective right under article and article of the convention see von hannover no v germany gc no and echr the applicant company argued that the publication of the impugned article and photograph had reported on the criminal conviction of h in a purely factual manner furthermore it had reported truthfully on the fact that the german newspaper bild had confronted the presidential candidate nh with the photo showing r with h and gk next the applicant company submitted that the statement that h wa a convicted neo nazi had been true referring to the case of österreichischer rundfunk v austria no december see also paragraph below the applicant company stated that the criminal proceeding against him and his conviction for act punishable under the prohibition act on account of his activity a a leading member of the extra parliamentary organisation opposition true to the people volkstreue außerparlamentarische opposition vapo formed an important part of contemporary judicial history the applicant company did not make any submission regarding hs conduct after his conviction in nor did it dispute the government submission that he had not been convicted since see paragraph below a to the consequence of the article in question the applicant company argued that it had had no repercussion for h he had not asserted during the domestic proceeding that there had been such repercussion and neither had any been identified by the national court the applicant company argued that accusing someone of an expunged criminal act under article of the criminal code see paragraph above did not form a basis for the claim under section of the copyright act in the sense of section et seq of the medium act in addition the court had already stated in the case of schwabe v austria august series a no b that a reference to previous criminal conviction wa covered by article of the convention in respect of politically significant matter the applicant company did not make any submission regarding the severity of sanction imposed on it by the domestic courtsb the government the government conceded that the injunction against the applicant company had constituted an interference with it right to freedom of expression this interference had been based on the law and had pursued a legitimate aim namely the protection of the right of others in particular h they considered that the remaining question wa whether the measure had also been necessary in a democratic society the article published by the applicant company had been about nh being confronted by the newspaper bild with the political background of his office manager and not with the political background of h the office manager brother and the plaintiff in the domestic proceeding giving rise to the present application h had featured in the report only in so far a he had also been depicted in the photograph dating from that had been printed likewise the subject of the article published in the german newspaper bild had been the political background of the office manager of nh and nh position in that regard this had clearly been indicated by the title of the article what is your staff member doing there mr nh however unlike in the article of the applicant company h had neither been mentioned by name nor referred to a a convicted neo nazi in the article of the german newspaper bild in the present case the picture in question had been neither published in the course of reporting on a crime or of any other reporting concerning h the content of the applicant company article had consisted of the position taken by a presidential candidate nh in respect of his office manager r who some people considered to have a certain proximity to the rightwing scene thus the subject of the article had been of general public interest and had formed part of a political debate in so far the austrian court only had a limited margin of appreciation to interfere with the applicant company right that were protected under article of the convention h had been convicted under the prohibition act by a final judgment in and had served a prison sentence until he had not thereafter been convicted of any other crime a ruled by the supreme court in it decision of january see paragraph above the reference to the fact that the brother of the office manager of a presidential candidate had been convicted more than twenty year earlier had had no objective connection to the report on the political background of that office manager there had thus been no objective justification for the reference because that reference had added nothing to a political debate or to a debate regarding the public interest unlike the reporting on the political orientation of that presidential candidate office manager andor on the presidential candidate position in respect of his office manager the interest of h wa quite obvious the publication of picture that together with the accompanying text recalled offence committed long before would disproportionately prejudice his advancement a he had already served his sentence had been socially integrated for year and had thus had a legitimate interest in ensuring that the public wa not reminded of offence that he had once committed that applied all the more given the fact that the reference in question had been made entirely without any information to the effect that the corresponding conviction by a criminal court had taken place more than twenty year before the sentence had long since been served and expunged from his criminal record and he had not been convicted for any crime since any other interpretation would run contrary to the meaning and purpose of expunging a conviction from a person criminal record with few exception all negative consequence arising by virtue of law from a conviction were erased upon expunged thereafter the person concerned wa deemed to have no record and wa not obligated to disclose such an expunged conviction see section of the criminal record deletion act quoted in paragraph above the legal system of austria attached great importance to the reintegration of convicted offender into society and to their interest in a reformed positive advancement after serving their sentence accusing someone of prior offence that had been served or waived wa an offence in itself see section of the criminal code quoted in paragraph above the public had already been informed in great detail about the criminal proceeding conducted against h his conviction in and his release in all those event had been the subject of extensive photojournalistic coverage without doubt the crime committed by h had been grave and of a political nature more than two decade later however it could be assumed that in the absence of any specific occasion and context no public interest in information any longer existed to justify publishing a picture with the accompanying text convicted neo nazi moreover it had to be assumed that the notoriety that h had definitely had at the time of his conviction had decreased quite considerably over more than two decade during which he had not committed any other offence that conclusion could not be altered by the argument that the applicant company article had been intended to portray the milieu in which r the office manager of the presidential candidate had moved in his past the public interest in such information could have been satisfied sufficiently by for instance simply printing the picture dating from together with an explanation to the effect that it showed r at a neo nazi meeting the fact that all the people shown in the picture wearing leather jacket and carrying baton andor giving the kühnen salute were attributable to the neo nazi scene must in any case have been obvious to any reader of the article this wa where the case at hand differed significantly from the fact on which the court judgment in the case of österreichischer rundfunk cited above had been based at that time it had been the temporal proximity between the release from prison of the applicant in that case and the report that had been relevant for the court decision against this backdrop the criterion of the completeness and correctness of the text accompanying the photograph developed by the court in it caselaw wa gaining significance however this wa precisely the requirement that the newspaper article of the applicant company had not met there had been no information in the newspaper article to the effect that h had served his sentence long before and had behaved well ever since in both of it decision adopted in the case giving rise to this application see paragraph and above the austrian supreme court referring to the court relevant caselaw and making reference to it decision in case no ob s where it had for the purpose of presenting the full fact demanded such additional information from the newspaper publisher in a very similar case had specifically pointed out that in the article in question the applicant company had not had regard to that requirement in the government view the interference had also been proportionate the austrian court had prohibited the applicant company from publishing image of h only if the text in question at the same time referred to him a a convicted neo nazi andor statement of equivalent meaning would have been made about him thus the domestic decision had not constituted a general prohibition on any photojournalistic coverage whatsoever or a ban on publishing any picture of h and they had not provided a fine or prosecution under section of the criminal code see paragraph above equally the claim for damage lodged by h against the applicant company had been dismissed see paragraph above the government therefore considered that there had been no violation of article in the instant case the court assessment the court observes that the present case concern proceeding under the copyright act brought by h against the applicant company in respect of a newspaper report in which his picture had been shown it did not address the reporting about him or the publication of the picture a such but only the publication of that picture together with certain accompanying statement see paragraph above the court ordered the applicant company to refrain from now on from publishing picture of h without his consent if at the same time he is called a convicted neo nazi in the text in question andor statement of equivalent meaning are made about him there see paragraph and above it is undisputed that the court judgment in these proceeding constituted an interference with the applicant company right to freedom of expression it is not in dispute either that the interference wa prescribed by law and served a legitimate aim namely the protection of the right and reputation of others in particular those of h the court agrees with this assessment the party argument thus concentrated on the necessity of the interference the issue in the present case is whether the domestic court ensured a fair balance between the protection of the applicant company right to freedom of expression on the one hand and the right to respect for private life of the opposing party on the other handa general principle the general principle regarding freedom of expression are wellestablished in the court caselaw see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no echr extract and the case cited therein although the press must not overstep certain bound regarding in particular protection of reputation and right of others it task is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with it obligation and responsibility information and idea on all matter of public interest not only doe the press have the task of imparting such information and idea the public also ha a right to receive them were it otherwise the press would be unable to play it vital role of public watchdog ibid in this regard the court reiterates that there is little scope under article of the convention for restriction on political speech or on debate on matter of public interest see for example couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above and the case cited therein a regard the freedom of expression within the context of reporting and publishing photograph the question of assessing the necessity of an interference with that freedom and the state margin of appreciation in that respect the court refers to it established caselaw in the case of couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above and von hannover no cited above and axel springer ag v germany gc no february the court note that application such a the present one call for an examination of the fair balance to be struck between on the one hand the applicant company right to freedom of expression and the public freedom of information under article and on the other hand the respect for the private life and the right to protection of one own image under article of the convention of the person concerned in examining this balance the court must have regard among other factor to the state positive obligation under article of the convention see x and y v the netherlands march series a no and von hannover no cited above and to the principle established in it settled caselaw regarding the essential role played by the press in a democratic society see news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i this includes reporting and commenting on court proceeding and more particularly criminal proceeding see ml and ww v germany no and and june with regard to person who have been convicted the court ha found without explicitly distinguishing between the seriousness of the underlying criminal offence that after a certain period of time ha elapsed and in particular a their release from prison approach convicted person have an interest in no longer being confronted with their act with a view to their reintegration in society this may be especially true once a convicted person ha been finally released likewise the public interest a regard criminal proceeding will vary in degree a it may evolve during the course of the proceeding according to a number of factor such a the circumstance of the case in question ibid referring to the case of österreichischer rundfunk cited above and mutatis mutandis segerstedt wiberg and others v sweden no echr vii the court in it caselaw ha identified a number of criterion within the context of balancing the competing right under article and of the convention see paragraph above in particular when the publication of photo wa at stake the relevant criterion include the contribution to a debate of public interest the degree of notoriety of the person affected the subject of the news report the prior conduct of the person concerned the content form and consequence of publication and where appropriate the circumstance in which the photograph were taken see von hannover no cited above von hannover no no september and axel springer ag cited above where it examines an application lodged under article the court will also examine the way in which the information wa obtained and it veracity and the gravity of the penalty imposed on the journalist or publisher see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés and axel springer ag both cited above the court considers in each case whether the criterion thus defined may be transposed to the case in question although certain criterion may have more or le relevance given the particular circumstance of the case see satakunnan markkinapörssi oy and satamedia oy v finland gc no june where the balancing exercise between the competing right ha been undertaken by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the court would require strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see axel springer ag von hannover no both cited above and more recently delfi a v estonia gc no echr in the case of österreichischer rundfunk cited above which concerned proceeding under the copyright act brought by h against a different medium company the domestic court had prohibited that medium company from showing hs picture in connection with any report stating that he had been convicted under the prohibition act once the sentence had been executed or once he had been released on parole the court found a violation of article of the convention for the following reason mr s who brought the proceeding at issue is a wellknown member of the neo nazi scene in austria the court ha already held in a similar case that a person expressing extremist view lay himself open to public scrutiny see news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i moreover mr s wa convicted of crime under the prohibition act in and wa sentenced to a lengthy prison term for being a leading member of vapo an organisation aimed at destroying the austrian constitutional order in the domestic court assessment the proceeding against mr s were among the most important one under the prohibition act at the time of his trial his picture wa widely published turning to the nature and subject matter of the news item broadcast by the applicant the court note that it wa a brief report dealing mainly with the release on parole of mr k the leader of vapo and the neo nazi scene in austria mr s wa mentioned a another convicted member of vapo who had also been released on parole a few week earlier it is not contested by the government that the news item concerned an issue of public interest consequently it related to a sphere in which restriction on freedom of expression are to be strictly construed accordingly the court must exercise caution when the measure taken by the national authority are such a to dissuade the medium from taking part in the discussion of matter of public interest see for instance thoma v luxembourg no echr iii and jersild v denmark judgment of september series a no pp the court note that the injunction granted by the domestic court wa phrased in broad term it prohibited the applicant from showing mr s picture in connection with any text mentioning his conviction under the prohibition act once the sentence ha been executed or once he had been released on parole while the court agrees that there may be good reason to prohibit the publication of a picture of a convicted person after his release on parole a number of element are to be taken into account when weighing the individual interest not to have his physical appearance disclosed against the public interest in the publication of his picture element that will be relevant are the degree of notoriety of the person concerned the lapse of time since the conviction and the release the nature of the crime the connection between the content of the report and the picture shown and the completeness and correctness of the accompanying text the domestic court attached great weight to the timeelement in particular to the long lapse of time since mr s conviction but did not pay any particular attention to the fact that only a few week had elapsed since his release they did not take into account his notoriety and the political nature of the crime of which he had been convicted nor did they have regard to other important element namely that the fact mentioned in the news item were correct and complete and that the picture shown wa related to the content of the report the latter element distinguish the present case from a comparable case österreichischer rundfunk v austria dec no may which wa declared inadmissible in that case the court found no indication of a violation of article a regard the prohibition to publish a convict picture after his release on parole it had regard to the fact that the picture of b who had been convicted under the prohibition act had been shown in a different context namely in connection with the investigation in respect of a spectacular series of letter bomb attack without mentioning that b had been acquitted of any involvement in these attack and without mentioning that he had served his sentence under the prohibition act and had been released on paroleb application to the instant case in exercising it supervisory function the court task is to review in the light of the case a a whole whether the decision the domestic court have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation have struck a fair balance between the right at stake and ruled in accordance with the criterion established by it for that purpose see paragraph and above accordingly the court will analyse in turn the element identified a relevant in this regard in it caselaw and the domestic court assessment thereofi contribution to a debate of general interest the court find that the overall subject of the article namely the fact that the presidential candidate nh surrounded himself with an office manager r who at least in the past had contact with person who had aimed at destroying the austrian constitutional order see österreichischer rundfunk cited above must be considered a having been of particular public interest at the time of it publication in this regard the court note i the delicate point at which the article appeared during the presidential election in after the constitutional court had ruled unconstitutional a runoff ballot between the two candidate for the highest office of the republic and ii the particular public interest in the election process and the candidate at the time see paragraph above thus the court note that there wa little scope under article of the convention to restrict the applicant company right to report on nh election campaign see paragraph above while the news report in question see paragraph above served a such that particular interest by covering nh political circle it did not itself even allege that there wa any direct link between the presidential candidate and h or that h had played any role in the election campaign the only indirect connection between h and nh election campaign that could be understood from the article wa that r who is hs brother and nh office manager had attended a neo nazi event in together with h and gk both h and gk had later undisputedly been criminally convicted under the prohibition act the vienna commercial court and the vienna court of appeal hence argued that they did not need to conduct a balancing exercise between the competing right at stake in the instant case see paragraph and above a h wa not the subject of the article and publishing the photo by mentioning that he wa a convicted neo nazi therefore did not contribute to a debate of general interest the supreme court contrasted the instant case with the court finding in the similar case of österreichischer rundfunk cited above and held that there wa no temporal connection between the photograph hs criminal conviction in and the incriminated article which wa published in see paragraph above it also referred to it reasoning in the provisional proceeding where it had found that the article impugned in the instant case had not concerned h but only his brother r there had thus been no objective justification for the reference to hs conviction see paragraph above considering that the applicant company did not either in the domestic proceeding see paragraph above or in it submission to the court see paragraph above allege a direct link between nh and h the court can accept the domestic court conclusion that publishing hs photograph in a report on nh political milieu with an incomplete accompanying text see paragraph below did not contribute to the debate on the election despite the particular public interest in the report a such see paragraph aboveii degree of notoriety of the person affected and subject of the news report the court reiterates that in it judgment österreichischer rundfunk cited above it ha found that the plaintiff in the proceeding giving rise to that case h who wa also the plaintiff in the instant proceeding wa a wellknown member of the neo nazi scene in austria the proceeding against him were among the most important one conducted under the prohibition act at the time of his trial his picture had been widely published ibid the court note moreover that vapo see paragraph above of which h used to be a leading member before his conviction in aimed at nothing le than destroying the austrian constitutional order österreichischer rundfunk cited above and the court ha already held in similar case that a person expressing extremist view lay himself open to public scrutiny ibid and news verlags gmb h co kg cited above this must apply all the more to person who did not only express extremist view but who committed severe crime such a those under the prohibition act that run counter to the letter and the spirit of the convention see in this context mutatis mutandis witzsch v germany dec no december and the case cited therein and more recently pastörs v germany no october the court attache particular importance to the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society when reporting on crime of that kind see paragraph above at the same time the court note that at the time the report wa published more than twenty year had passed since hs conviction and some seventeen year since his release see paragraph and above and paragraph below compare and contrast österreichischer rundfunk cited above there is no indication in the party submission or in the document submitted that h sought the limelight after his release compare and contrast ml and ww v germany cited above where the applicant returned to the limelight after making several attempt to have their criminal proceeding reopened and after addressing the press on the subject for these reason the court attache weight to the fact that the applicant company while alleging that hs conviction and the circumstance that had led to it were of historical importance and that h had not ceased his political activity in the neo nazi scene after his release from prison in see paragraph above and paragraph below did not even argue that h wa still a person of public interest and notoriety at the time of the publication of the photograph in in it submission to the domestic court it only referred to a wikipedia entry and another article concerning alleged event in the content of which were disputed by h paragraph above it neither specified hs conduct at these event nor elaborated on it submission that h wa an absolute person of contemporary history ibid this is all the more remarkable a h had previously initiated proceeding against the applicant company in a similar context because of a different publication see paragraph and above in that case the supreme court had already found in that h had been fully reintegrated into society after his release see the supreme court judgment from october ob s ibid in the absence of such specification the civil court did not examine further the degree of notoriety of h at the time of the publication while the court support in general the applicant company view that proceeding against neo nazi form an important part of judicial history in austria see paragraph above it can not be automatically concluded in the instant case that hs notoriety a an individual remained the same over the year see paragraph above and below a regard the subject matter of the report the court ha stated above that it did not relate to the criminal proceeding against h or hs role in the election campaign see paragraph aboveiii prior conduct of the person concerned according to the supreme court finding see paragraph and above which remained undisputed by the applicant company h wa reintegrated in society after his release and did not have any further criminal conviction after that of the applicant company a the defendant in the civil proceeding did not make any submission regarding hs conduct after his conviction other than those dealt with in paragraph above for the reason outlined above ibid the domestic civil court were not obliged to go beyond those submission and to ass in more detail hs conduct between his release in and the publication in iv method of obtaining the information and it veracity it wa undisputed during the domestic proceeding and before the court that the statement made by the applicant company in connection with h namely that he wa a former convicted neo nazi wa true incidentally this wa one of the reason why the domestic court dismissed his claim for damage see paragraph above the information itself can be considered common knowledge and is easily obtainable through an internet search typing in hs full name however with regard to the publication of a picture of a convicted person after his or her release on parole the court ha found not only the correctness of the accompanying text to be a relevant element when weighing the individual interest in not having his or her physical appearance disclosed against the public interest in the publication of his or her picture but also the completeness of that text see österreichischer rundfunk cited above in the instant case the applicant company report referred to h a a convicted neo nazi without providing further detail it did not inform the reader of the fact that the conviction referred to dated back to that h had served his sentence and that he had not been convicted of a crime since the information that the conviction had in the meantime been expunged from his criminal record see paragraph above could have been ascertained by the applicant company by consulting the criminal record deletion act see paragraph above against this backdrop the court find that the information provided by the applicant company in the text accompanying the photograph wa true but not complete in respect of an essential point compare and contrast österreichischer rundfunk cited above where the court found that the fact mentioned in the news item had been correct and complete and that the picture shown had related to the content of the reportv content form and consequence of the publication of the article the court ha examined the content and form of the news report together with the accompanying photograph when considering it contribution to a debate of general interest see paragraph above a to it consequence the court note that h a the plaintiff in the domestic proceeding did not allege that there had been any tangible consequence arising from the publication in question a stated above the domestic court for that reason did not grant him the damage claimed see paragraph and abovevi severity of the sanction imposed in the instant case the restriction imposed on the applicant company wa of a very limited scope the applicant company wa not sanctioned for the report or for the publication of the photograph either in civil or in criminal proceeding compare and contrast schwabe cited above where the applicant had been criminally convicted of defamation neither wa it ordered to refrain completely in the future from publishing hs image without his consent compare and contrast mosley v the united kingdom no may or even from reporting on his trial in the applicant company wa only prohibited from publishing hs picture if it wa accompanied by the statement that he wa a convicted neo nazi compare and contrast österreichischer rundfunk cited above where the national court had ordered the applicant in that case to refrain from publishing hs picture without his consent if it wa accompanied by any text stating that he had been convicted under the prohibition act once the sentence had been executed or he had been released on parole the applicant company had to reimburse h for the cost of the domestic proceeding but there wa no compensation awarded and no fine imposed see paragraph above the court furthermore take note of the fact that in it reasoning the supreme court referred to it judgment in previous proceeding case no ob s see paragraph and above a stated above in that case the applicant company wa ordered to refrain from publishing hs image without his consent only if the accompanying text described him a a neo nazi leader and did not state at the same time that he had already served his prison sentence and had behaved well since the court concludes from the supreme court finding see paragraph and above and in line with the government submission see paragraph above that in the instant case the applicant company had not met the criterion established by the supreme court in it previous judgment see paragraph above and by the court see paragraph abovevii the lapse of time between the conviction the release and the publication of the article in question in the case of österreichischer rundfunk cited above the court ha held that another element to be taken into account within the context of the publication of an image of a convicted person after his or her release wa the time that had lapsed since the conviction and the release in that case ibid the court found a violation of article a the domestic court had not taken into account among other thing see paragraph above that only a short time had passed since hs release at the time of the publication of the article that wa the subject of that case see paragraph above the instant case can be distinguished from the case of österreichischer rundfunk cited above in respect of that point a in the meantime over twenty year had passed between hs criminal conviction in and the publication of the article at issue and some seventeen year since his release in see paragraph above the court note that the supreme court referring to the court caselaw explicitly pointed out this lack of temporal connection see paragraph above within this context the court considers it important to take into account the fact that hs conviction under the prohibition act had already been deleted from his criminal record at the time of the publication in question see paragraph above while is doe not lose sight of the severe political nature of the crime committed by h before and of the danger with regard to attack on democracy if journalist are hindered from reporting on the crime of neo nazi see paragraph above in fine these consideration have to be weighed against the importance of the reintegration into society of person who have been released from prison after serving their sentence and their legitimate and very significant interest after a certain period of time in no longer being confronted with their conviction see paragraph above this is what h essentially argued in the domestic proceeding see paragraph abovec conclusion the court reiterates that the member state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed under that provision is necessary see paragraph above in the instant case while the vienna commercial court and the vienna court of appeal concluded from the supreme court reasoning in the provisional proceeding see paragraph above that a balancing of interest did not have to be carried out see paragraph and above the supreme court did in fact balance the competing interest at stake and by doing so examined the case on the basis of the criterion that were established by the court own judgment in the case of österreichischer rundfunk cited above which had also concerned h the supreme court noted that the article had not concerned h but only his brother r and that the text accompanying hs photograph had lacked the information that he had meanwhile served his sentence and had behaved well since see paragraph and above thus in contrast with the fact underlying the above mentioned judgment in the present case the published picture wa not related to the content of the report and the accompanying text wa correct but not complete see paragraph and above the supreme court further noted citing the case of österreichischer rundfunk that there wa no temporal connection between the photograph taken in hs criminal conviction in and the applicant company calling him a convicted neo nazi in the impugned article of see paragraph above a regard the notoriety of h the court ha already noted that the applicant company did not substantiate it submission in this regard within this context there wa no reason for the civil court to carry out a detailed examination of whether h wa still a person of public interest and notoriety see paragraph and above the court further note that the applicant company allegation that h wa still active in the rightwing scene wa not supported by any evidence other than two report referring to his participation in event in while it did not dispute the fact that h had not been convicted again after his release in ibid on the basis of these fact the court can accept that the domestic court for the purpose of the civil claim did not ass the question of hs conduct between and in more detail ibid a stated above the court is mindful of the essential role played by the press in protecting democracy which includes notably reporting on presidential candidate their social and political environment and in this context on certain crime see paragraph and above however having analysed the relevant element see paragraph above the court note that the domestic court did not generally prevent the applicant company from reporting on h and on the serious crime once committed by him but only prohibited it to publish hs picture if at the same time he wa called a convicted neo nazi in the accompanying report see paragraph above in it reasoning the supreme court emphasized that in a context a the present one the connection between the content of the report and the picture a well a the completeness and correctness of the accompanying text had to be among other thing considered ibid the content of the article published by the applicant company did not concern h see paragraph above and the information given by the applicant company wa not complete see paragraph above therefore the court can not but conclude that in the specific circumstance of the case the reason adduced by the domestic court were undertaken in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw and were relevant and sufficient to justify the interference it see no strong reason to substitute the domestic court view with it own see the caselaw quoted in paragraph above it follows that the interference wa necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the courtdeclares unanimously the application admissible hold by four vote to three that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on april pursuant to rule and of the rule of court ilse freiwirth yonko grozev deputy registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the dissenting opinion of judge guerra martin joined by judge vehabović and motoc is annexed to this judgment ygrif dissenting opinion of judge guerra martin joined by judge vehabović and motocwith all due respect to my colleague i am unable to subscribe to their view that article ha not been violated the main legal issue in this case is to ass whether the decision of the domestic court struck a fair balance between the competing right at stake the freedom of expression and the public freedom of information under article the right to respect for one private life and the right to protection of one own image under article of the convention and ruled in accordance with the criterion established by the court for that purpose it is not unusual that in case raising issue of conflict of right where a fair balance must be struck between two different right it may be difficult to draw a clear dividing line between violation and nonviolation because it depends on the weight that each person give to each individual criterion and to all of them together a for striking a balance between the freedom of expression and the right to respect for one private life the court already ha wellestablished criterion for doing so it go without saying that i do not wish to depart from those criterion accordingly i can accept the reasoning of the majority concerning some of the criterion for example the part of the judgment on how wellknown the person affected by the news wa in my opinion however the majority underestimated other criterion for instance the contribution to a debate of general interest and the veracity of the information and also overestimated others for example the lapse of time between the conviction the release and the publication of the information in short my main divergence with the majority concern the assessment of the first criterion relating to the contribution to a debate of general interest i can not accept the domestic court conclusion that publishing hs photo in a report on nh political milieu did not contribute to a debate of general interest ie the debate on the election in my view given that the article drew attention to the neo nazi past of someone who might still be close to a presidential candidate even if it is highly unlikely the public ha the right to have access to that information in principle an elector with access to all the relevant information is betterplaced and freer to choose between two or more candidate than an elector who lack that information this assertion is even more valid in the context of the election in question which had been disputed and wa subject to a decision of the constitutional court declaring the first election void the runoff ballot thus had to be repeated to put it differently while for the majority publishing hs photograph in a report on nh political milieu with an incomplete accompanying text did not contribute to the debate on the election despite the particular public interest in the report a such for me on the one hand the particular context of those election justified the broadest possible diffusion of information by the medium on the candidate and their entourage and on the other hand that context meant that it wa quite important for the public to know who might be supporting each candidate in my opinion democracy ha to protect itself from certain political party and person who want to destroy it membership of a neo nazi party is such a serious threat to democracy that the mere suspicion that a presidential candidate might have such individual among hisher supporter is ample justification for publishing the photograph in question i would take the view that the domestic court did not have regard to the importance of the medium in protecting democracy particularly where the neo nazi ideology is concerned the court attached greater importance for instance to the lapse of time between the conviction the release and the publication of the article than to the information itself for me by contrast the neo nazi past of a person who might could still have a slight connection to a politician standing for president in a democratic country even if that connection is minimal is important even if there is a long lapse of time between hisher neo nazi past and the election additionally i can not follow the majority a regard the scant importance which it attached to the veracity of the fact concentrating much more on the fact that the news wa not complete for me on the contrary the veracity of the fact is crucial the omission of some aspect doe not undermine such veracity to conclude my divergency with the majority have led me to conclude that there wa a violation of article of the convention,,,
58,the applicant is a registered association which ha it seat in vienna it aim is to research and study past and present transfer of ownership of agricultural and forest land in order to reach conclusion a to the impact of such transfer on society the applicant association also give opinion on draft law falling within it field of interest in essence agricultural and forest land transaction require approval by local and regional authority the latter are called regional real property transaction commission landes grundverkehrskommissionen the aim of this requirement laid down in the real property transaction act of the länder is to preserve land for agricultural use and forestry and in some of the region including tyrol to avoid the proliferation of second home the applicant association state that it is sent all decision issued by the regional real property transaction commission with the exception of the one for tyrol in the decision it receives the name of party and other sensitive data are usually anonymised on april the association asked the tyrol real property transaction commission the commission to provide by mail all decision issued since january in anonymised form the cost thereof to be reimbursed by letter of july the commission replied that it could not comply with the request owing to lack of time and personnel on july the applicant association submitted a further request this time requesting the provision by mail of all decision issued since january in anonymised form in the event of refusal of the application it demanded a formal decision in accordance with the tyrol access to information act tiroler auskunftspflichtgesetz the information act the applicant association argued that since the commission decision concerned civil right within the meaning of article of the convention the decision should be either publicly announced or made public by other appropriate mean in it decision of october the commission rejected the request holding that the transmission of anonymised copy of it decision did not constitute information within the meaning of section of the information act which defines information a existing knowledge on matter known to the authority at the time it provides the information moreover even if the request were to fall within the scope of that provision the information act stated that pursuant to section subparagraph c there wa no duty to provide the information if doing so would require so many resource that the functioning of the authority would be affected the decision stated that complaint could be lodged with the constitutional court verfassungsgerichtshof and the administrative court verwaltungsgerichtshof the applicant association complained to both the constitutional court and the administrative court it relied on article of the convention in it submission in reply to the applicant association complaint to the constitutional court and the administrative court the commission maintained that it decision did not constitute information within the meaning of the information act it argued that a decision contained the fact of the case and the legal conclusion the authority had drawn from them legal argument could be discussed and decision could be challenged and set aside if the legal conclusion were found to be wrong therefore giving someone access to a decision wa comparable to giving someone legal advice a opposed to providing information a defined in the information act on september the administrative court declared that it did not have jurisdiction to deal with the case and rejected the applicant association complaint the administrative court held that it wa only competent to deal with complaint against decision regarding transfer of building plot and not with complaint brought against the commission decision on transfer of agricultural or forest land a the applicant association had not claimed to have been party to the transfer of a building plot it could not base it complaint on that status neither did the information act contain any rule stating that complaint about decision by the commission pursuant to the information act were to be lodged with the administrative court therefore the matter wa excluded from the administrative court jurisdiction consequently the statement in the commission decision that a complaint could be lodged with the administrative court wa not correct on february the constitutional court declined to deal with the case for lack of prospect of success from the perspective of constitutional law and also because the matter wa not excluded from the administrative court jurisdiction the decision wa served on the association representative on april after the government had been notified of the present application the applicant association relying on the government argument in respect of exhaustion of domestic remedy see paragraph below lodged an application under article of the federal constitution seeking a ruling from the constitutional court on the negative conflict of jurisdiction between it and the administrative court on december the constitutional court issued a decision stating that it wa competent to rule on the applicant association complaint against the commission decision of october consequently it set aside it own decision of february and awarded the applicant association reimbursement of the cost of the proceeding in a further decision of december the constitutional court ruled on the merit of the applicant association complaint referring to the court caselaw and it own caselaw it held in particular that whilst the right to receive information enshrined in article of the convention prohibited state from restricting the receipt of information that others wished to or might be willing to impart it did not by contrast impose a positive obligation on state to collect and disseminate information of their own motion the constitutional court added that in accordance with it established caselaw article did not require the state to grant access to information or to make information available of it own motion consequently the commission refusal to transmit anonymised copy of all decision issued during a specific period of time to the applicant association did not constitute an interference with the latter right under article of the convention a to the applicant association argument that the commission decision wa arbitrary a it had failed to provide reason the constitutional court referred to the explanatory report on the information act and endorsed the commission view that the applicant association request wa not merely a question of obtaining information about one or more specific issue but would require the commission to compile of it own motion all decision issued over a period of some year to anonymise them and to send paper copy thereof to the applicant association the commission had therefore rightly taken the view that the applicant association request did not fall within the scope of section of the information act moreover the commission had also dealt with the merit of the request in that it had concluded that the provision of information could be refused pursuant to section subparagraph c of the information act a it would require investigation calculation or preparation considerably impinging on the fulfilment of it other task lastly the constitutional court observed that the applicant association could be implicitly relying also on article of the convention it noted that neither the court caselaw in respect of public access to court decision nor it own caselaw guaranteed the right to obtain anonymised copy of all decision issued by the commission over a lengthy period according to the constitutional court caselaw access had to be given to the judgment delivered by the highest court which dealt with case raising important legal issue however this did not apply to all the commission decision ii relevant domestic law and practicea the information act the information act regional law gazette regulates the duty of the authority to provide information section provides a follows the authority of the land municipality municipal association and any other selfgoverning body regulated by regional law are under an obligation to provide anyone with information about their sphere of competence unless provided otherwise in section information is the notification of existing knowledge on matter known to the authority at the time it provides the information section in so far a relevant provides a follows anyone may require authority of the land municipality municipal association and any other selfgoverning body regulated by regional law to provide information orally in writing or by phone telex or telegraph section in so far a relevant provides a follows no information shall be provided if the provision of such information is contradictory to a statutory duty of confidentiality there is no duty to provide information ifc the provision of information would require investigation calculation or preparation considerably impinging on the proper fulfilment of the authority other task b the tyrol real property transaction act the aim of the tyrol real property transaction act a in force at the material time regional law gazette a amended by regional law gazette wa to preserve land for agricultural and forestry use and to avoid the proliferation of second home contract concerning the transfer of ownership and certain other right relating to agricultural or forest land therefore required approval by local real property transaction authority appeal against their decision could be lodged with the commission either by the party if they considered the decision had violated their right or by the regional real property transaction referee grundverkehrsreferent if he considered that the decision ran contrary to the public interest a complaint could be lodged with the constitutional court against decision of the commission relating to the transfer of agricultural and forest land if approval wa declined the transfer of land wa null and void the regional real property transaction commission wa composed of nine member and substitute member who were appointed for five year and were not bound in the exercise of their function by any instruction a a rule the commission held oral hearing in public an annual report on the situation of real property transfer in tyrol published by the regional government includes a report containing general information on the commission activity it can be seen from these report that in the period from to between and appeal per year were lodged with the commission the majority of which concerned transfer of agricultural and forest land it can also be seen that the commission issued decision in decision in decision in decision in decision in and decision in the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant association complained that it right to receive information had been violated a it wa refused access to the decision of the tyrol real property transaction commission the applicant association relied on article which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the government had initially argued that the applicant association had not exhausted domestic remedy since it had failed to make use of an application under article b of the federal constitution in order to resolve the negative conflict of jurisdiction which resulted from the administrative court decision of september and the constitutional court decision of february a the applicant association subsequently requested that the constitutional court rule on that conflict of jurisdiction and obtained a decision by the constitutional court on the merit on december see paragraph above the government withdrew their objection based on the nonexhaustion of domestic remedy the court note that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission the applicant association asserted that article of the convention required state to a certain extent to make information available to the public in it view the decision of judicial body such a the commission should be publicly accessible given the possibility of electronic data processing the authority could easily create an online information system providing access to the decision of the commission while making provision for the protection of confidential data where necessary such a system namely the federal legal information system rechtsinformationssystem de bundes existed at federal level and made decision of the highest court and various other court and authority available where such a system did not exist the state should at least provide anonymised paper copy of decision upon request regarding the government argument that austrian administrative law did not make provision for unrestricted access to file the applicant association submitted that it had not requested access to file but rather the provision of decision in anonymised form in the applicant association view such interference with it right to receive information could not be justified it asserted that interest in the rule of law and due process argued in favour of making decision by judicial authority available to the public while the interest of confidentiality could be protected by anonymising them in response to the government argument that granting the request would have demanded considerable effort the applicant association criticised the fact that the commission had not provided any figure indicating the number of decision to be made available or the actual amount of time needed to provide anonymised copy the government argued that the commission refusal to provide anonymised paper copy of all decision issued since january could not be regarded a an interference with the applicant association right under article according to the court caselaw article of the convention prohibited contracting state from interfering with the receipt of information that someone wished to impart however it did not impose a positive obligation on the state to collect and disseminate information itself although the state had to set up it information system in such a way that an individual could obtain generally accessible information it wa not obliged to provide access to confidential information access to file containing decision issued in administrative proceeding wa usually given only to party with a special legal interest in the specific case the applicant association could not claim to have a special interest in all decision issued by the commission over a lengthy period thus the refusal to provide anonymised copy of all decision issued since january did not constitute an interference with it right under article of the convention moreover a right to be provided with all decision issued by the commission over a lengthy period could not be inferred from article of the convention either in the alternative assuming that there had in fact been an interference with the applicant association right under article the government asserted that such interference had been justified they pointed out in particular that it served legitimate aim it protected the right of others namely their interest in nondisclosure of the content of proceeding affecting them personally which might for instance include personal data concerning the location and price of land that had been purchased and prevented the disclosure of confidential information moreover it served to preserve the proper functioning of the authority concerned had the applicant association request been granted compliance with it would have required substantial resource to anonymise numerous decision issued over a number of year and would thus have jeopardised the fulfillment of the commission main task a weighing up of interest showed that this latter interest had to prevail over the applicant association interest in obtaining access to all these decision in anonymised form consequently the interference had also been proportionate the court assessmenta whether there ha been an interference the court ha consistently recognised that the public ha a right to receive information of general interest it caselaw in this field ha been developed in relation to press freedom the purpose of which is to impart information and idea on such matter the court ha emphasised that the most careful scrutiny on it part is called for when measure taken by the national authority may potentially discourage the participation of the press one of society watchdog in the public debate on matter of legitimate public concern see társaság a szabadságjogokért v hungary no april with reference to observer and guardian v the united kingdom november series a no thorgeir thorgeirson v iceland june series a no jersild v denmark september series a no and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii furthermore the court ha held that the gathering of information is an essential preparatory step in journalism and an inherent protected part of press freedom see dammann v switzerland no april however the function of creating forum for public debate is not limited to the press that function may also be exercised by nongovernmental organisation the activity of which are an essential element of informed public debate the court ha therefore accepted that nongovernmental organisation like the press may be characterised a social watchdog in that connection their activity warrant similar convention protection to that afforded to the press see társaság a szabadságjogokért cited above and animal defender international v the united kingdom gc no april the applicant association is a nongovernmental organisation the aim of which is to research the impact of transfer of ownership of agricultural and forest land on society it also contributes to the legislative process by submitting comment on draft law falling within it field of expertise in the present case it wished to obtain information about the decision of the commission that is to say the appellate authority approving or refusing transfer of agricultural and forest land under the tyrol real property transaction act the aim pursued by that act namely preserving land for agricultural and forestry use and avoiding the proliferation of second home are subject of general interest the applicant association wa therefore involved in the legitimate gathering of information of public interest it aim wa to carry out research and to submit comment on draft law thereby contributing to public debate consequently there ha been an interference with the applicant association right to receive and to impart information a enshrined in article of the convention see társaság a szabadságjogokért cited above see also kenedi v hungary no may b whether the interference wa justified the court reiterates that an interference with an applicant right under article will infringe the convention if it doe not meet the requirement of paragraph of article it should therefore be determined whether it wa prescribed by law whether it pursued one or more of the legitimate aim set out in that paragraph and whether it wa necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve those aim in dismissing the applicant association request the commission relied on section and subparagraph c of the information act the court is thus satisfied that the interference at issue wa prescribed by law within the meaning of article of the convention the government argued that the interference served legitimate aim namely the protection of the right of others and the nondisclosure of confidential information the applicant association argued that these interest could have been protected by anonymising the copy of the decision the court considers that the interference in question can be seen a having pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the right of others the court must examine whether the interference wa also necessary within the meaning of article in respect of the general principle concerning the necessity of an interference with the right to freedom of expression the court refers to it recent judgment in the case of animal defender international cited above in the specific context of access to information the court ha held that the right to receive information basically prohibits a government from preventing a person from receiving information that others wished or were willing to impart see leander v sweden march series a no furthermore it ha held that the right to receive information can not be construed a imposing on a state positive obligation to collect and disseminate information of it own motion see guerra and others v italy february report of judgment and decision i however in társaság a szabadságjogokért which concerned a request for access to information by a nongovernmental organisation for the purpose of contributing to public debate the court noted that it had recently advanced towards a broader interpretation of the notion of the freedom to receive information and thereby towards the recognition of a right of access to information cited above furthermore it drew a parallel to it caselaw concerning the freedom of the press stating that the most careful scrutiny wa called for when authority enjoying an information monopoly interfered with the exercise of the function of a social watchdog ibid with reference to chauvy and others v france no echr vi in the present case the applicant association requested paper copy of all decision issued by the commission from january to mid it argued in essence that the state had an obligation either to publish all decision of the commission in an electronic database or to provide it with anonymised paper copy upon request the court doe not consider that a general obligation of this scope can be inferred from it caselaw under article however it task in the present case is to examine whether the reason given by the domestic authority for refusing the applicant association request were relevant and sufficient in the specific circumstance of the case and whether the interference wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued both the commission and the constitutional court relied on a twofold argument firstly they considered that the applicant association request did not fall within the scope of the information act secondly they argued that even if it did the request could be refused on the ground that it fulfilment would require substantial resource which would jeopardise the fulfilment of the commission other task the constitutional court noted in particular that the applicant association request wa not concerned with obtaining information on one or more specific issue but would have required the commission to compile of it own motion all decision issued over a period of some year to anonymise them and to send paper copy thereof to the applicant association the government also relied on this line of argument the court observes that there is a difference between the present case and társaság a szabadságjogokért which concerned a request by a nongovernmental organisation to be given access to a particular document a constitutional complaint for the review of certain provision of the criminal code lodged by a member of parliament in reaching it conclusion that the refusal of access wa in breach of article the court had regard to the fact that the information sought wa ready and available and did not necessitate the collection of any data by the government see társaság a szabadságjogokért cited above however in assessing whether the interference complained of in the present case wa necessary within the meaning of article the court must consider all the circumstance of the case the court note that the applicant association by requesting anonymised copy of the commission decision accepted that the decision at issue contained personal data which would have to be removed before the decision could be made available it also understood that the production and mailing of the requested copy involved a certain cost which it proposed to reimburse nevertheless the applicant association request met with an unconditional refusal given that the commission is a public authority deciding dispute over civil right within the meaning of article of the convention see eisenstecken v austria no echr x with further reference which are moreover of considerable public interest the court find it striking that none of the commission decision wa published whether in an electronic database or in any other form consequently much of the anticipated difficulty referred to by the commission a a reason for it refusal to provide the applicant association with copy of numerous decision given over a lengthy period wa generated by it own choice not to publish any of it decision in this context the court note the applicant association submission which ha not been disputed by the government that it receives anonymised copy of decision from all other regional real property commission without any particular difficulty in sum the court find that the reason relied on by the domestic authority in refusing the applicant association request for access to the commission decision though relevant were not sufficient while it is not for the court to establish in which manner the commission could and should have granted the applicant association access to it decision it find that a complete refusal to give it access to any of it decision wa disproportionate the commission which by it own choice held an information monopoly in respect of it decision thus made it impossible for the applicant association to carry out it research in respect of one of the nine austrian länder namely tyrol and to participate in a meaningful manner in the legislative process concerning amendment of real property transaction law in tyrol the court therefore concludes that the interference with the applicant association right to freedom of expression can not be regarded a having been necessary in a democratic society there ha accordingly been a violation of article of the convention ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant association complained that it did not have an effective remedy in respect of it complaint under article it relied on article of the convention which read a follows everyone whose right and freedom a set forth in the convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation ha been committed by person acting in an official capacity the government contested that argument the court note that this complaint is linked to the one examined above and must therefore likewise be declared admissible the applicant association asserted that in their respective decision of september and february the administrative court and the constitutional court had refused to examine the merit of it complaint concerning the commission refusal to provide it with copy of all decision issued over a specified period of time the government submitted that a complaint to the constitutional court constituted an effective remedy even a refusal to deal with a complaint entailed a summary examination of the subject matter moreover in the present case the applicant association had had the possibility of challenging the constitutional court refusal to deal with the case by lodging an application under article of the federal constitution in order to resolve the negative conflict of jurisdiction between the administrative court and the constitutional court a the court ha held on many occasion article of the convention guarantee the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the convention right and freedom in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order the effect of article is thus to require provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an arguable complaint under the convention and to grant appropriate relief the scope of the contracting state obligation under article varies depending on the nature of the applicant complaint however the remedy required by article must be effective in practice a well a in law the effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of article doe not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant see for instance kudła v poland no echr xi the court therefore ha to examine whether austrian law afforded the applicant association the possibility of complaining about the alleged violation of it right to freedom of expression and whether this remedy wa effective in the sense that it could have afforded appropriate redress for the alleged violation the court observes that the administrative court held that it wa not competent to deal with the applicant association complaint the constitutional court in it turn also refused to deal with the case making the assumption that the case wa not excluded from the administrative court jurisdiction however the applicant association had the possibility of bringing an application under article of the federal constitution which allowed this negative conflict of jurisdiction to be resolved it made use of this option with the result that the constitutional court set aside it previous decision and ruled on the merit of the applicant association complaint under article the fact that the outcome wa not favourable for the applicant association doe not detract from the effectiveness of the remedy the court is therefore satisfied that the applicant association had an effective remedy at it disposal in respect of it complaint under article consequently there ha been no violation of article of the convention iii application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court find that there ha been a violation of the convention or the protocol thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party a cost and expense whereas the applicant association did not claim compensation for pecuniary or nonpecuniary damage in it observation of august it claimed a total of euro eur for the cost and expense incurred in the domestic proceeding comprising eur for expense incurred before the commission eur for cost and expense incurred before the administrative court and eur for cost and expense incurred in the first set of proceeding before the constitutional court the applicant association also claimed cost for a further set of proceeding to be conducted before the constitutional court under article of the federal constitution unless such cost were to be reimbursed by the constitutional court in respect of the convention proceeding the applicant association claimed adequate compensation for the cost of representation without specifying an amount the government observed that the applicant association had failed to substantiate the expense it claimed to have incurred before the commission they noted the claim for reimbursement of cost and expense incurred before the administrative court and for the first set of proceeding before the constitutional court without making any further comment moreover they observed that the cost of a possible further set of proceeding before the constitutional court had not yet been actually incurred lastly the government submitted that the applicant association had failed to substantiate the cost claimed in respect of the convention proceeding a required they observed that the applicant submission before the court were in any event largely similar to those already made before the domestic authority according to the court caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of cost and expense only in so far a it ha been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable a to quantum in the present case taking into account the document in it possession and the above criterion the court award a total amount of eur for the cost incurred in the proceeding before the administrative court and the first set of proceeding before the constitutional court it note that in the second set of proceeding before the constitutional court the applicant association wa awarded reimbursement of it cost and ha not made any further claim in that respect in the proceeding before the court furthermore the court dismisses the remainder of the claim for cost and expense in the domestic proceeding and considers it reasonable to award the sum of eur for the proceeding before the court consequently the court rounding up the amount award a total of eur under the head of cost and expense b default interest the court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the european central bank to which should be added three percentage point for these reason the court declares unanimously the application admissible hold by six vote to one that there ha been a violation of article of the convention hold unanimously that there ha been no violation of article of the convention hold unanimouslya that the respondent state is to pay the applicant association within three month from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with article of the convention eur seven thousand five hundred euro plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant in respect of cost and expensesb that from the expiry of the abovementioned three month until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage point dismisses unanimously the remainder of the applicant association claim for just satisfaction done in english and notified in writing on november pursuant to rule and of the rule of court søren nielsen isabelle berro lefèvre registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the separate opinion of judge møse is annexed to this judgment iblsnpartly dissenting opinion of judge møse i agree that for the reason set out in the judgment there wa no violation of article but can not follow my colleague in finding that article ha been violated see paragraph to of the judgment the general principle concerning freedom of expression are well known and have been summarised for instance in mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no july it is also common ground that the press exercise a vital role of public watchdog in imparting information of serious public concern when measure are taken or sanction imposed by national authority in such matter the most careful scrutiny on the part of the court is called for see among many authority bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no and echr iii the grand chamber ha accepted that when a nongovernmental organisation ngo draw attention to matter of public interest it is exercising a public watchdog role of similar importance to that of the press see animal defender international v the united kingdom gc no april i agree with this point of departure however whether there is a violation or not depends on a concrete assessment in animal defender which concerned the prohibition of paid political advertising on radio and television the majority did not find a breach of article at chamber level an ngo role a a watchdog wa raised in vides aizsardzibas klubs v latvia no may steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii and riolo v italy no july which related to a researcher in political science writing a newspaper article the fact in those case are very different from the present case a regard access to information i agree with the initial recapitulation of relevant case law in paragraph of the judgment including the reference to leander v sweden march series a no and guerra and others v italy february report of judgment and decision i the majority then refer to társaság a szabadságjogokért v hungary no april which concerned access to information by an ngo in my view that case doe not support a finding of a violation in the present case see paragraph below in paragraph of the judgment reference is made to dammann v switzerland no april the case of társaság a szabadságjogokért cited above and and kenedi v hungary no may the first judgment concern the conviction of a journalist who had taken certain preparatory step to obtain information in alleged breach of the swiss penal code and is clearly distinguishable from the present case nor is the third judgment comparable the applicant a historian had obtained a court judgment granting him access to certain document deposited with the ministry of the interior in spite of subsequent court decision in line with the original judgment the authority obstructed his access a mentioned by the majority see paragraph of the judgment the case of társaság a szabadságjogokért cited above concerned a request by an ngo to be given access to a particular document a constitutional complaint the court found that the refusal of access wa in breach of article taking into account that the information sought wa ready and available and did not require the collection of any data by the government ibid with reference to guerra and others cited above moreover the court held in that case that private data protection consideration could not justify the interference ibid by contrast the request made by the applicant association in the present case required the provision of anonymised paper copy of all decision by the tyrol real property commission issued over a period of more than five year the decision were not in a state to be sent it appears that the applicant association itself by requesting anonymised copy understood that the decision concerned contained personal data which would have to be removed before they could be made available the commission refused the request on the ground that it fulfilment even if it were accepted that it fell within the scope of the information act would require substantial resource which would jeopardise the fulfilment of the commission other task the constitutional court endorsed this line of argument finding that the commission would have to compile all the decision anonymise them and send paper copy to the applicant association it is noteworthy that according to the annual report published by the regional government the commission issued between and decision per year in the relevant period from to see paragraph of the judgment the applicant association request therefore related to several hundred decision in my view there wa thus no arbitrariness in the argument that complying with the applicant association request would have had a negative impact on the fulfillment of the commission task i therefore accept that the reason given for the refusal of the applicant association request were relevant and sufficient lastly it should be noted that the applicant association is not left completely without any possibility to obtain information about the commission decision a certain amount of information is available in the regional government annual report moreover the commission is not an authority of last resort a complaint against it decision can be lodged with the constitutional court and a collection of the latter decision which a a rule contain a summary of the challenged decision is published in an online database the federal legal information system consequently the interference with the applicant association right under article wa also proportionate in my view these consideration lead to the conclusion that the domestic authority did not overstep their margin of appreciation when refusing the applicant association request the fact that all other regional real property commission sent out anonymised copy is not sufficient to alter that conclusion there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for citation purpose the short title österreichische vereinigung zur erhaltung stärkung und schaffung v austria should be

59,the applicant company is a limited liability company established under austrian law with it registered office in innsbruck it publishes bezirksblatt lokalausgabe hall rum the bezirksblatt a weekly newspaper distributed free of charge in a region of tyrol one edition of the newspaper had copy circulated in january approximately copy of an anonymous letter were sent out many of them to member of the supervisory board of the tourism association for hall and wattens two town in tyrol the letter written in the form of a survey concerned cm and jm referred to a mm on account of the initial letter of their surname cm wa at the time a practising lawyer and chairman of the tourism association for hall and wattens when the article wa published election for the post of chairman of the tourism association were underway and cm wa again standing a a candidate for the post his brother jm also a practising lawyer had been active in politics in hall for many year and wa at the material time the member of the city council responsible for public finance he wa also chairman of the supervisory board of stadtwerke hall the town electricity water and heating supplier the survey part of the letter read in the course of our mm survey i would like to ask you the following question would you buy a car from this man would you stake your money on a promise made by this man doe this man have the necessary personal professional qualification ha this man ever built anything properly is this man honest with his own family would you allow this man to execute your will if you have answered one of these question with no please ask yourself why you want to leave this man in his current position we being entrepreneur will decide at the next tourism association meeting with our vote it is our promise our money our qualification our association and our heritage l a journalist working for the applicant company newspaper wa informed of the anonymous letter he telephoned cm and jm who commented on it claiming it to be part of a political campaign against them a few minute later cm telephoned the journalist back and asked him whether he wa planning to publish the letter when l confirmed that he wa cm said that he did not agree to it publication and that he would take legal action if it were published in the january issue of the bezirksblatt the applicant company published an article entitled anonymous campaign against mm the subheading read mm or cm and jms full surname are the target of a not at all bittersweet campaign the article contained the story of the anonymous letter and cm and jms reply to the accusation made in it it reported that both of them had stated that the letter had attempted to harm their political activity and had considered the accusation to be a personal insult the article contained photo of cm and jm and a reproduction of the letter containing the question set out above relying on section of the medium act cm and jm brought proceeding against the applicant company for defamation requesting compensation and publication of the judgment the applicant company argued that it conduct did not amount to defamation a the article had only quoted someone el statement and had duly distanced itself from the content of the letter moreover the information had been a matter of public interest on march the innsbruck regional court found in favour of the claimant and ordered the applicant company to publish the judgment and to pay eur in compensation to each of them the regional court held that the article itself merely commented on the letter in an objective manner and did not agree with it offensive content furthermore the nature of the office held by the claimant meant that they were often in the local medium but had so far not been the subject of any negative campaign however the anonymous letter which had been included in the article fulfilled the actus reus of defamation a it accused cm and jm of dishonesty and other disreputable character trait relating to both their professional and private life both had experienced negative repercussion a a result of the article in their professional activity a lawyer in that they had repeatedly been confronted with the allegation made in the anonymous letter the regional court referring to the applicant company argument that it had only quoted a statement made by someone else noted that section of the medium act only permitted quoting the statement of a third person if the quotation wa truthful and there wa an overriding public interest in it publication this rule would even apply if the identity of the third person having made the statement wa unknown in any case the court held that it wa required to balance the public interest in disseminating information about the statement quoted against the claimant interest in protecting their reputation it accepted that the local public had an interest in knowing about a campaign against the chairman of the tourism association and a local politician however public interest did not justify reproduction of the anonymous letter in the article the applicant company could have provided information on the campaign against cm and jm without printing the defamatory letter in that connection the court observed that by printing the letter the applicant had also made it entire content known to a far greater number of people than the letter itself had reached the applicant company appealed and lodged a plea of nullity relying on the medium act in particular on the socalled law on quotation developed under section of that act it asserted that the regional court had wrongly considered there to be no overriding public interest in publishing the anonymous letter in particular the article and the letter related to the tourism association which wa a public law corporation and the applicant were both public figure in local politics the innsbruck court of appeal dismissed the appeal on august it held that the law on quotation wa not applicable in the present case it wa not possible to claim for damage under article of the medium act in respect of quotation in the medium where the identity of the third person making the offensive statement wa known in such case the person concerned could seek compensation from the person who had made the offensive statement in the first place a in the present case the person who had made the offensive statement had remained anonymous the applicant company could not rely on section of the medium act furthermore the court of appeal confirming the regional court view found that in any event there wa no overriding public interest in publication of the anonymous letter the judgment wa served on the applicant counsel on january ii relevant domestic law and practice section of the medium act provides for the strict liability of the publisher in case of defamation the victim can thus claim damage from the publisher section in so far a material read a follows where a medium publishes statement which constitute the actus reus of disparagement insult derision or defamation the victim shall have a claim against the owner of the medium publisher for damage for the injury suffered the right referred to in paragraph above shall not apply in the case of defamationa where the statement published are true orb where there wa an overriding public interest in publication and the requisite journalistic diligence having been observed there were sufficient reason to believe that the statement wa true where a truthful quotation of a statement made by a third person is concerned and there wa an overriding public interest in knowing about the statement quoted for the purpose of section of the medium act defamation is to be understood a defined in article of the criminal code strafgesetzbuch which read a follows anybody who in such a way that it may be noticed by a third person attribute to another a contemptible characteristic or sentiment or accuses him of behaviour contrary to honour or morality and such a to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six month or a fine anyone who commits this offence in a printed document by broadcasting or otherwise in such a way a to make the defamation accessible to a broad section of the public shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine the person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true in the case of the offence defined in paragraph he shall also not be liable if circumstance are established which gave him sufficient reason to believe that the statement wa true the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant company complained that the court judgment had violated it right to freedom of expression it relied on article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the court note that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submissionsa the applicant company the applicant company maintained that the interference with it right to freedom of expression wa not necessary in a democratic society a required by article of the convention in particular it asserted that the article had been published in the context of the upcoming election of the chairman of the local tourism association and had contributed to a debate of general interest moreover cm and jm were public figure on account of their activity in the political scene and the nature of the office held by them the applicant company also submitted that the court had failed to evaluate the reproduction of the anonymous letter against the background of the article a a whole which gave room to the statement of the two people concerned and duly distanced itself from the accusation made against them furthermore the applicant company citing albert engelmann gesellschaft mb h v austria no january contested the domestic court view that the reproduction of an anonymous letter had to be distinguished from the quotation of a third person statementb the government the government pointed out in the first place that the domestic court had not prevented the applicant company from publishing the article itself they had ordered it to pay compensation to cm and jm only in respect of the publication of the anonymous letter furthermore they submitted that the interference with the applicant company right to freedom of expression wa based on law and served a legitimate aim namely the protection of the reputation and right of others in that connection they noted that the anonymous letter which the applicant company had published in the bezirksblatt accused cm and jm gratuitously of dishonesty and other reprehensible character trait and had therefore interfered with their right under article of the convention regarding the necessity of the interference the government argued that in case which required a balancing of the respective interest under article and of the convention the domestic court enjoyed a certain margin of appreciation in the present case the court had exercised their discretion in accordance with the criterion established by the court caselaw they had accepted that the article itself contributed to a public debate while considering that reproduction of the anonymous letter could not be justified by the duty of the press to impart information the court had observed in particular that the anonymous letter had made farreaching allegation of dishonesty and other reprehensible character trait against cm and jm both in their professional life a practising lawyer and in their private life the anonymous letter thus contained excessive value judgment a it did not provide any factual basis for the accusation made the court had also taken into account the fact that the alleged deficiency in the work or character of cm and jm had not been the subject of any public discussion before publication of the article including the anonymous letter in the government view the domestic court had rightly considered that section of the medium act did not apply a the impugned statement could not be attributed to a third person but wa anonymous and moreover there had been no overriding public interest in it publication lastly the court had had regard to the fact that the article had brought the content of the anonymous letter to the attention of a far larger public since the letter itself had originally only been addressed to some recipient the court assessment it is not in dispute that the court judgment constituted an interference with the applicant company right to freedom of expression which wa based on section of the medium act taken in conjunction with article of the criminal code and served a legitimate aim namely the protection of the reputation and right of others the party argument concentrated on the question whether this interference wa necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention in respect of the general principle developed by it caselaw under article relating to the freedom of the press the court refers to it assessment in a number of recent case see mgn limited v the united kingdom no january von hannover v germany no gc no and echr and axel springer ag v germany gc no february in these judgment the court also set out the relevant principle to be applied when examining the necessity of an instance of interference with the right to freedom of expression in the interest of the protection of the reputation or right of others it noted that in such case the court may be required to verify whether the domestic authority struck a fair balance when protecting two value guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain case namely freedom of expression protected by article and the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see mgn limited cited above von hannover no cited above and axel springer ag cited above in the context of the present case the court reiterates that the right to protection of reputation is a right protected by article of the convention a part of the right to respect for private life see axel springer ag cited above and polanco torres and movilla polanco v spain no september in von hannover no cited above and axel springer ag cited above the court defined the contracting state margin of appreciation and it own role in balancing these two conflicting interest it held in particular that where the balancing exercise between the right under article and of the convention ha been undertaken by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the court would require strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see also mgn limited cited above the court went on to identify a number of criterion a being relevant where the right of freedom of expression is being balanced against the right to respect for private life see von hannover no cited above and axel springer ag cited above namelya contribution to a debate of general interestb how well known is the person concerned and what is the subject of the reportc prior conduct of the person concernedd method of obtaining the information and it veracitye content form and consequence of the publicationf severity of the sanction imposed in the present case the court will therefore examine whether the domestic court carried out the balancing exercise in conformity with the criterion laid down in it caselawa contribution to a debate of general interest the domestic court accepted that the article itself contributed to a debate of general interest namely the upcoming election of the chairman of the local tourism association and the campaign against cm who held the post of chairman at the time and wa standing again a a candidate and his brother jm a local politicianb how well known is the person concerned and what is the subject of the report the domestic court also took into account that cm and jm were well known to the local public and had been in the local medium on account of their respective function a chairman of the tourism association for hall and wattens and member of the hall city council furthermore they noted that the article had reported on the anonymous letter directed against cm and jm in an objective mannerc prior conduct of the person concerned regarding the prior conduct of the people concerned the court noted that prior to the dissemination of the anonymous letter there had been no public discussion of cm and jms professional or private conduct in other word there had not been any allegation of misconduct against them the court observes that there is no indication that cm and jm although often in the local medium sought the limelight or laid open any detail regarding their professional life a practising lawyer or their private livesd method of obtaining the information and it veracity the court note that while the case file doe not contain any information on how the journalist l managed to obtain a copy of the anonymous letter it show that he duly gave cm and jm an opportunity to comment before it publication but proceeded to publish the letter anyway against cm explicit wish regarding the veracity of the information the applicant company did not claim that the allegation made in the anonymous letter against cm and jm were true or had any factual basis it merely relied on the argument that printing the letter wa no more than a quotation of someone el statement however the domestic court argued that the publication of an anonymous letter had to be distinguished from the quotation of a third person statement and that in any case the question whether there wa an overriding public interest in publication of the anonymous letter had to be examined the court considers that this approach is not at variance with it caselaw it ha repeatedly held that punishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statement made by another person would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matter of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reason for doing so see jersild v denmark september series a no thoma v luxembourg no echr iii and verlagsgruppe news gmb h v austria no december most of the case concerned statement made by third person whose identity were known however it is important to note that the court own examination of whether there had been a violation of article of the convention involved an assessment of the news item or newspaper article a a whole in accordance with the criterion developed by it caselaw among other criterion the court looked into the question whether the reporting wa balanced and had regard to the context in which the offensive quotation had been made see for instance jersild cited above the case cited by the applicant company which related to the publication of a letter to the editor whose author could not be identified indicates that journalist or editor may also quote anonymous statement albert engelmann gesellschaft mb h cited above however the case also demonstrates that the final assessment of whether there ha been a violation of article depends on a balancing of all relevant criterion the court did not share the domestic court view that the fact that the letter to the editor had been an anonymous one wa of relevance it finding of a violation of article in that case wa mainly based on the consideration that the offending statement contained in the anonymous letter were value judgment which had a sufficient factual basis in statement which the claimant himself had previously made ibid in the present case a ha already been noted above there had been no allegation against cm and jm before the publication of the anonymous letter and there is no indication that their own conduct provided any factual basis for the value judgment contained in the anonymous letter which were thus no more than a gratuitous attack on their reputation in these circumstance the court accepts that there were strong reason for considering that the publication of the anonymous letter transgressed the limit of permissible reportinge content form and consequence of the publication in respect of the content form and consequence of the publication the domestic court had regard to the fact that the impugned article in the bezirksblatt had not only reported on the anonymous letter in the context of the upcoming election of the chairman of the local tourism association but had reproduced the anonymous letter and thus had disseminated it to a far larger public than the restricted circle of initial recipient see paragraph and above they also referred to the negative repercussion cm and jm had experienced in their professional life a practising lawyersf severity of the sanction imposed the court note that the sanction imposed namely the order to pay compensation of eur to each of the claimant and to publish the regional court judgment is not of a degree of severity which would render the interference disproportionateg overall conclusion the foregoing consideration are sufficient to enable the court to conclude that the domestic court duly applied the criterion established by the court caselaw when ordering the applicant company to pay compensation to cm and jm under article of the medium act they gave relevant and sufficient reason for arriving at the conclusion that while the publication of the article itself contributed to a debate of general interest reproduction of the anonymous letter amounted to defamation the court doe not see any strong reason to substitute it own view for that of the contested decision of the domestic court there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the application admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on october pursuant to rule and of the rule of court andré wampach isabelle berro lefèvre deputy

considered that the fact that the applicant had chosen to have cheque for the first twentyseven transaction made out to his son who transferred the equivalent amount into the applicant bank account wa capable of giving rise to the inference that the applicant knew very well that what he wa doing wa wrong and in breach of duty a to whether the applicant had a reasonable excuse or justification for his action the judge found it open to the jury to conclude that he did not having regard to the number of story involved the length of time over which information wa divulged the amount of money involved and the fact that the applicant had not taken up any matter which featured in the story through official channel despite his claim to have been concerned for reason of public interest in respect of the seriousness test the judge took the view that a jury could conclude that the necessary harm to the public interest had been established by the very fact of a prison officer having been in a longstanding relationship with a journalist and in breach of his duty repeatedly divulging information about the prison for money conviction and sentence on june the applicant wa convicted by the jury the following day he wa sentenced to twenty month imprisonment in his sentencing remark the judge accepted that the applicant had had genuine concern about the manner in which the prison wa being run this he considered had been in part a motivating factor for his action the judge continued that said in my judgment that doe not tell the whole story on a number of occasion a you yourself conceded in evidence you disclosed information when the public interest had nothing at all to do with what you were imparting the judge considered that the applicant had been motivated by money and by an intense dislike of the prison governor he further pointed out that the applicant had been a tradeunion representative and could have used official channel to disseminate information had public interest been his sole concern a to the harm caused by his action the judge referred to the suspicion that had fallen on other innocent member of staff since the identity of the person leaking story wa unknown he also highlighted the damage to prisoner who had been demonised in the tabloid story a well a the resulting potential for enmity from other inmate and inmate general mistrust of prison staff because of the leak finally the fact that for a lengthy period of time and on numerous occasion the applicant had acted in flagrant breach of rule which the judge wa satisfied he knew very well prohibited such contact with the press represented a very serious breach of trust in sentencing him to a term of imprisonment the judge emphasised the scope and scale of the offending in the case the court of appeal the applicant sought leave to appeal against conviction and sentence his application for leave to appeal against sentence wa refused on september on september he wa granted leave to appeal his conviction in his written argument prior to the appeal hearing he advanced two ground of appeal first he argued that the trial judge had erred in failing to stay the prosecution a an abuse of process see paragraph above disclosure of his name a a journalistic source had breached article because mgn had been acting under pressure and because the disclosure process had not been prescribed by law a it had lacked the necessary safeguard second he argued that the judge should have acceded to his submission of no case to answer see paragraph above he contended that his misconduct did not meet the criminal threshold but amounted rather to a disciplinary offence and the appropriate article compliant sanction would therefore have been disciplinary proceeding not a criminal prosecution he added that the criminal prosecution of a disciplinary offence offended the principle of legal certainty and thus violated article of the convention on october the court of appeal dismissed the appeal in it judgment it listed the story for which the applicant information wa said to have been the source which it noted ranged from general story in which individual generally remained anonymous to specific or personal story in which prisoner or staff were named or identifiable the court noted at the outset that all of the caselaw of the european court of human right cited in argument wa concerned with the compulsory disclosure of journalistic source or material it found no evidential basis for the applicant suggestion that the police had exerted any improper pressure on mgn to disclose information in particular the comment of the trial judge regarding the newspaper hope that their assistance would avoid prosecution at a higher level see paragraph above merely recorded the motivation of the newspaper it did not amount to a finding that the police had sought to impose any pressure on them indeed the court said all the evidence suggested the reverse it explained the police made no threat or promise express or implied about the bringing of a prosecution against the company or company or their top management the police were seeking voluntary disclosure under the term of the mo u clause of which made clear that mgn retained the right to invoke article ground for refusing disclosure mgn wa a large organisation with access to inhouse and external legal advice it wa inconceivable that mgn did not give careful consideration to whether to make disclosure to the police in the context of the publicity which operation elveden and the leveson inquiry were attracting the police were entitled to assume that the disclosure which wa proffered wa a a result of a considered and informed decision with the benefit of full and accurate legal advice the court concluded that the disclosure had not been procured by any improper pressure or coercion but had been truly voluntary there had therefore been no misconduct by the police in receiving or acting upon the information the court further rejected the argument that voluntary disclosure wa a breach of the applicant article right a a journalistic source to have his anonymity maintained it considered that there wa room for doubt whether the applicant article right were engaged at all in these circumstance referring to council of europe recommendation see paragraph below it noted that while the right of journalist to withhold journalistic material wa an important article right there wa no concomitant obligation on journalist to do so the court also noted that the edition of the editor code of practice described a journalist obligation to protect confidential source of information a a moral obligation see paragraph below in the event the court did not find it necessary to decide the point since even if such a right existed it wa not unqualified assuming in the applicant favour that article wa engaged the court wa satisfied that the use of the material in his prosecution in the circumstance of his case wa compatible with article the freedom of expression which potentially fell within article wa the provision of information in return for the corrupt acceptance of money by him a a public official over a prolonged period which amounted to the serious criminal offence of misconduct in public office revelation of the applicant wrongdoing wa necessary and proportionate for the important public interest of prosecuting a crime which existed in this context to maintain the integrity and efficacy of the prison service and the public confidence in it the court then turned to examine the second ground of appeal that the trial judge should have acceded to his nocasetoanswer submission it observed that while the challenge before the trial court had been that the prosecution case had been insufficient to be left to the jury in respect of all four element of the offence see paragraph above on appeal the argument had been confined to the second and third element see paragraph below only a to the seriousness test the third element the court agreed with the finding of the trial judge see paragraph above it considered that the prosecution evidence wa capable of meeting the high threshold of criminality because of the harm to the public interest caused by the applicant conduct in this respect the court referred to the extent of the applicant corrupt activity taking payment of over gbp for a period of some five year wa conduct that the jury had been entitled to conclude wa not justified in the public interest it wa also conduct that caused significant public harm because corruption of a prison officer on this scale undermined public confidence in the prison service the court further referred to the impact of the leak from an unknown source on trust and morale among and between prisoner and staff and the deterrent effect on staff and prisoner reporting incident a regard the second element of the test the applicant argument wa that what he had done had been in accordance with the freedom of expression protected by article and it could not therefore amount to a breach of duty the court disposed of this argument on the basis that the applicant conduct amounting to the serious offence of misconduct in public office wa not protected by article lastly the court dealt briefly with the article point see paragraph in fine above which it noted had not been pursued in oral argument it concluded that there wa no lack of certainty in the seriousness element of the offence of misconduct in public office it had recently been clearly articulated and explained in attorney general reference no of and r v chapman and others see paragraph below in the latter case it had been made clear that the level of seriousness which had to be reached wa defined by recognised criterion on which the jury were to be directed the seriousness test wa therefore sufficiently clear to enable a person with appropriate legal advice if necessary to regulate his behaviour and foresee whether such behaviour wa capable of amounting to misconduct in public office the supreme court the applicant applied for leave to appeal to the supreme court relying on article and of the convention on january the court of appeal refused to certify a point of law of general public importance and refused leave to appeal relevant legal framework and practicedomestic law and practicemisconduct in public office the element of the offence misconduct in public office is a commonlaw offence not defined in statute it carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment the leading modern case defining the offence is attorney general reference no of ewca crim in which the court of appeal at paragraph stated that the element of the offence were a public officer acting a such wilfully neglect to perform his duty andor wilfully misconduct himself to such a degree a to amount to an abuse of the public trust in the office holder without reasonable excuse or justification a regard the seriousness test the court explained the threshold is a high one requiring conduct so far below acceptable standard a to amount to an abuse of the public trust in the office holder a mistake even a serious one will not suffice the motive with which a public officer act may be relevant to the decision whether the public trust is abused by the conduct the element of culpability must be of such a degree that the misconduct impugned is calculated to injure the public interest so a to call for condemnation and punishment it will normally be necessary to consider the likely consequence of the breach in deciding whether the conduct fall so far below the standard of conduct to be expected of the officer a to constitute the offence the conduct can not be considered in a vacuum the consequence likely to follow from it will often influence the decision a to whether the conduct amounted to an abuse of the public trust in the officer a default where the consequence are likely to be trivial may not posse the criminal quality required a similar default where the damage to the public or member of the public is likely to be great may do so the consequence of some conduct such a corrupt conduct may be obvious the likely consequence of other conduct of public officer will be le clear but it is impossible to gauge the seriousness of the defaulting conduct without considering the circumstance in which the conduct occurs and it likely consequence in the light of operation elveden and the resulting criminal investigation the director of public prosecution issued cps guideline for prosecutor on assessing the public interest in case affecting the medium on september the guidance specifically referred to article of the convention and emphasised that prosecutor were required to take the right to freedom of expression including the right to receive and impart information into account when taking decision on whether to prosecute in march the court of appeal considered the ambit of the offence in the case of r v chapman and others ewca crim where one of the issue before the court wa whether the trial judge direction concerning the threshold of seriousness had been correct the court referred to attorney general reference no of see paragraph above and noted that it had not been suggested that this formulation of the law wa in any way inaccurate it considered that there were two way in which the jury might be assisted to ass seriousness the first wa to refer them to the need for them to reach a judgment that the misconduct wa worthy of condemnation and punishment the second wa to refer them to the requirement that the misconduct had to be judged by them a having had the effect of harming the public interest on the latter the court went on to explain in our view in the context of provision of information to the medium and thus the public that is the way in which the jury should judge the seriousness of the misconduct in determining whether it amount to an abuse of the public trust in the office holder the jury must in our view judge the misconduct by considering objectively whether the provision of the information by the office holder in deliberate breach of his duty had the effect of harming the public interest if it did not then although there may have been a breach or indeed an abuse of trust by the office holder visàvis his employer or commanding officer there wa no abuse of the public trust in the office holder a the misconduct had not had the effect of harming the public interest no criminal offence would have been committed in the context of a case involving the medium and the ability to report information provided in breach of duty and in breach of trust by a public officer the harm to the public interest is in our view the major determinant in establishing whether the conduct can amount to an abuse of the public trust and thus a criminal offence for example the public interest can be sufficiently harmed if either the information disclosed itself damage the public interest a may be the case in a leak of budget information or the manner in which the information is provided or obtained damage the public interest a may be the case if the public office holder is paid to provide the information in breach of duty the law commission project the law commission wa set up for the purpose of promoting the reform of the law in it began a project on the offence of misconduct in public office it reform objective were to decide whether the offence of misconduct in public office should be abolished retained restated or amended it published an issue paper on january launching the first phase of the consultation process appendix c to the paper is entitled misconduct in public office and the echr it identified the definition of the seriousness test a being one of the main difficulty from the perspective of article of the convention the paper continued c this question wa the main focus of the recent court of appeal decision in chapman here the seriousness test wa compared to the test in gross negligence manslaughter which also ha difficulty in term of circularity and uncertainty the court felt that it is not helpful for a jury to be told that the breach of duty must be so serious a to amount to a criminal act and sought to solve this difficulty by applying another method of determining whether the conduct wa so serious it held that the jury must be referred to the requirement that the misconduct must be judged by them a having the effect of harming the public interest unfortunately the concept of public interest is not one with consensus a to it meaning and therefore may not be a much clearer basis for the test the law commission concluded in so far a relevant that the seriousness test wa illdefined and vague and that since it wa a core element of the offence the law might be incompatible with article of the convention paragraph c in the second phase of the consultation process the law commission published consultation paper no of september reforming misconduct in public office and invited response it explained that in the light of the response received it intended to decide on it final recommendation and present them to government at paragraph of the paper the law commission noted that numerous problem had been identified including an abuse of the public trust is crucial in acting a a threshold element of the offence but is so vague that it is difficult for investigator prosecutor and jury to apply the paper continued paragraph the lord chief justice lord thomas reiterated recently in the case of chapman that the legal position is that an abuse of the public trust is one that ha the effect of harming the public interest however it remains unclear what role if any factor such a consequence and impropriety of motive will play in the assessment of harm to the public interest we consider that the difficulty currently experienced with the definition of seriousness in the offence are unlikely to be resolved by the court without a more fundamental review of this element of the offence there are two problem with this element first the jury is being asked to make a circular assessment of whether an individual breach of duty is serious enough to be criminal it is criminal because it is serious it is serious because it is criminal secondly this may be compounded by the fact the jury is being asked to do so without any clear indication of what could amount to serious and therefore criminal misconduct the lack of comprehensive guidance a to what make misconduct serious cause difficulty for investigator prosecutor judge and jury it is particularly difficult in term of making decision a to where the line should be drawn between disciplinary and criminal proceeding the law commission final report and recommendation were published on december in it report it repeated it concern a to the difficulty a jury may have in applying the seriousness criterion overall a regard the commonlaw offence it concluded in summary we consider the following to be the main concern it is not clear in all case whether a person might be subject to the offence a the category of public office is not defined with sufficient precision this creates problem in practice including erroneous charging decision and successful appeal and may offend article of the european convention on human right the fault element that must be proved appears to vary depending on the circumstance of the case creating additional complexity and leading to costly appeal the seriousness threshold that the offence amount to an abuse of the public trust is highly subjective and difficult to apply this ha led to concern that the offence is being pursued in some circumstance that are not sufficiently blameworthy so a to justify criminal consequence there is a general lack of definition in the scope and subject matter of the offence which ha led to it application in contentious context the law commission accordingly recommended the abolition of the commonlaw offence and it replacement with two statutory offence corruption in public office and breach of duty in public office duty related to employment in the prison service rule of the prison rule provides no officer shall make directly or indirectly any unauthorised communication to a representative of the press or any other person concerning matter which have become known to him in the course of his duty article of the civil service code provides civil servant must not misuse their official position or information acquired in the course of their official duty to further their private interest or those of others they should not receive benefit of any kind from a third party which might reasonably be seen to compromise their personal judgment or integrity protection of journalistic source clause of the editor code of practice of the independent press standard organisation is entitled confidential source and provides journalist have a moral obligation to protect confidential source of information international law and practicecouncil of europe recommendation no r recommendation no r on the right of journalist not to disclose their source of information wa adopted by the committee of minister of the council of europe on march it set out in an appendix principle concerning the right of journalist not to disclose their source of information principle provides that domestic law should provide for explicit and clear protection of the right of journalist not to disclose information identifying a source in accordance with article of the convention pursuant to principle the right of journalist not to disclose information identifying a source must not be subject to other restriction than those mentioned in article of the convention according to principle journalist should be informed by the competent authority of their right not to disclose information identifying a source a well a the limit of this right before a disclosure is requested council of europe recommendation recommendation of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on the protection of journalist source wa adopted on january paragraph provides public authority must not demand the disclosure of information identifying a source unless the requirement of article paragraph of the convention are met and unless it can be convincingly established that reasonable alternative measure to disclosure do not exist or have been exhausted the legitimate interest in the disclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in the nondisclosure and an overriding requirement of the need for disclosure is proved at paragraph the assembly welcome the fact that journalist have expressed in professional code of conduct their obligation not to disclose their source of information when they receive information confidentially it explains that this professional ethical standard ensures that source may rely on confidentiality and decide to provide journalist with information which may be of public concern it invite journalist and their organisation to ensure through selfregulation that source are not disclosed the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the offence of misconduct in public office wa too vague for him to have foreseen that a a result of his action he would be subject to criminal prosecution he relied on article of the convention which read a follows no one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it wa committed nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that wa applicable at the time the criminal offence wa committed admissibility the court is of the opinion that the complaint raise sufficiently complex issue of fact and law so that it can not be rejected a manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible merit the party submissionsa the applicant the applicant submitted that at the material time it had not been possible for him to foresee that by breaching the general rule of his employment he would be subject to criminal trial and imprisonment it wa only after he had voluntarily ceased his activity that prosecution were initiated against public servant and journalist for the offence of misconduct in public office if information had been provided and money paid he contended that it wa not until the court of appeal judgment in r v chapman and others see paragraph above that it became clear that payment for information alone could constitute criminal conduct this development he said had not been predictable and postdated his own conduct the applicant referred to the view of the law commission that the offence wa ill defined see paragraph above and submitted that the piecemeal development of the law made it difficult for citizen to predict even after relying on legal advice or to regulate their conductb the government the government pointed out that article did not require criminal offence to have a statutory footing the court caselaw had recognised the compatibility with article of change to criminal offence including commonlaw offence a a result of legal development the element of the offence at issue in the present case had been clarified in attorney general reference no of with equivalent precision to statutory offence well before the applicant had begun to commit it see paragraph above in particular the government endorsed the conclusion of the court of appeal that the seriousness test wa sufficiently clear to enable a person with appropriate legal advice to regulate his behaviour and foresee whether it wa capable of amounting to misconduct in public office concerning the law commission project see paragraph above the government submitted that none of the issue highlighted in the issue paper arose in the applicant case the conduct for which the applicant had been convicted had always fallen within the range of conduct to which the offence undoubtedly applied the applicant disclosure to the journalist were a he might have foreseen and any competent lawyer would have advised him misconduct in public office on any view the court assessmenta general principle article should be construed and applied in such a way a to provide effective safeguard against arbitrary prosecution conviction and punishment among it guarantee it lay down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused detriment it follows that offence must be clearly defined by law when speaking of law article implies qualitative requirement notably those of accessibility and foreseeability this requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision if need be with the assistance of the court interpretation of it and after taking appropriate legal advice what act and omission will make him criminally liable see del río prada v spain gc no and echr and dallas v the united kingdom no february with further reference the progressive development of criminal law through judicial lawmaking is a wellentrenched and necessary part of legal tradition in the contracting state article of the convention can not be read a outlawing the gradual clarification of the rule of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen see del río prada cited above and dallas cited above with further reference it is primarily for the national authority notably the court to resolve problem of interpretation of domestic legislation it is not the task of this court to substitute itself for the domestic court a regard the assessment of the fact and their legal classification provided that these are based on a reasonable assessment of the evidence the court role is confined to ascertaining whether the effect of such an interpretation are compatible with the convention see dallas cited above b application of the general principle to the fact of the case the court emphasis at the outset that the commonlaw nature of the offence of misconduct in public office doe not in itself give rise to any particular concern under article the court caselaw make clear that article doe not require a criminal offence to be placed on a statutory footing see for example dallas cited above and sw v the united kingdom november series a no b where the court found no violation in case concerning commonlaw offence what is important is that whatever the basis for the offence the substantive guarantee of legal certainty are satisfied the party do not dispute the four element of the offence of misconduct in public office or that these four element were clearly articulated by the court of appeal in attorney general reference no of see paragraph above well before the applicant began to provide information to the journalist in exchange for money the applicant contends however that the content of the offence wa too vague to satisfy the requirement of article he refers to the work of the law commission see paragraph above in this respect the applicant did not dispute before the court of appeal that the first and fourth element of the test for misconduct in public office see paragraph above had been made out see paragraph above he did not contest that disclosing internal prison information to the press breached his employment duty a set out in the prison rule see paragraph above but argued that his conduct wa protected by article his challenge to the clarity of the offence essentially concerned the third element namely the seriousness test see paragraph above thus the court startingpoint is the explanation of the seriousness test given in attorney general reference no of itself see paragraph above there the court of appeal pointed to the role played by the motive with which a public officer acted the circumstance in which the impugned conduct occurred and the consequence of the breach in establishing whether the requisite seriousness threshold had been attained the fact that the applicant wa paid to disclose the sensitive information in question indisputably pertains to his motive for acting and also form part of the circumstance in which the conduct occurred it therefore ought to have been plain to him before embarking on his course of conduct in that his accepting payment in exchange for story wa likely to be a factor which would be taken into account by the court in assessing whether the criminal offence of misconduct in public office had been committed in fact in deciding whether there wa a case to answer the trial judge considered that the fact that the applicant had chosen to have a number of cheque made out to his son wa capable of giving rise to the inference that the applicant knew very well that what he wa doing wa wrong and in breach of duty see paragraph above the court agrees and considers in particular that the attempt to conceal the payment demonstrates that the applicant wa well aware of the potential role that the payment of money might play in any subsequent investigation of wrongdoing the applicant ha argued that the importance of payment to the establishment of the offence wa not fully evident until the court of appeal judgment in r v chapman and others see paragraph above the court observes however that payment wa only one of the element taken into consideration by the domestic authority in establishing the requisite seriousness threshold for the offence it further reiterates that article doe not preclude the gradual clarification of the rule of criminal liability through judicial interpretation see the caselaw quoted in paragraph above in the applicant case it is satisfied that any development of the law in r v chapman and others wa consistent with the essence of the offence and could have been reasonably foreseen it must also have been apparent to the applicant from attorney general reference no of that the consequence of his action would be taken into account when establishing whether the seriousness test had been met the sentencing judge pointed to the suspicion that had fallen on innocent member of staff a a result of the leak by an unknown source the damage to prisoner demonised in the press and the general enmity and mistrust that the leak caused both within the prison population and between prisoner and staff see paragraph above the court of appeal agreed with these finding adding that corruption of a prison officer on the scale present in the applicant case undermined public confidence in the prison service see paragraph above these consequence were considered to be serious none of the conclusion by the domestic court can be said to have been unforeseeable or surprising lastly the description of the seriousness test itself in attorney general reference no of tends to suggest that the scope and scale of the behaviour in question could be a relevant factor when assessing seriousness in the present case a the trial judge and the court of appeal pointed out see paragraph and above the applicant disclosed information to a newspaper in exchange for payment on forty occasion over a period of five year in flagrant breach of rule of which he wa well aware in particular in his sentencing remark the judge emphasised the very serious breach of trust which had occurred in the case when imposing a custodial sentence of twenty month imprisonment the applicant ha argued that his behaviour ought to have been sanctioned only in disciplinary proceeding rather than by way of a criminal prosecution the court observes that conduct doe not fall outside the scope of the criminal law merely because it also constitutes a disciplinary offence a noted above the applicant placed some reliance on the law commission work see paragraph above the court observes that the law commission final report identifies a concern a to legal certainty from the perspective of article but this is limited to the definition of public office the applicant did not contest that this criterion wa evidently satisfied in his case see paragraph and above in any event the report recognises that the classification of public office is clear for civil servant a category which included the applicant while the report also note that the nature of the seriousness threshold ha led to concern that the offence is being prosecuted in circumstance not sufficiently blameworthy a to justify criminal consequence this is clearly not the case here a explained in the preceding paragraph the domestic court in the applicant case pointed to the serious nature of his offending the court doe not exclude that there may be case in which given their specific fact prosecution and conviction for misconduct in public office were arguably not foreseeable however for the reason outlined above it doe not consider the applicant prosecution and conviction to be such a case in conclusion the court is satisfied that the applicant ought to have been aware if necessary after having sought legal advice that by providing internal prison information to a journalist in exchange for money on numerous occasion over a fiveyear period he risked being found guilty of the offence of misconduct in public office there ha therefore been no violation of article of the convention alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the disclosure of his identity by mgn to the police and his subsequent prosecution and conviction violated his right to protection a a journalistic source under article of the convention which provides everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the court considers it appropriate to examine each of these two complaint separately the disclosure of the applicant identity admissibilityc the party submission the government submitted that article did not apply to the mere provision by mgn and receipt by the police of voluntary information they underlined that the disclosure had been voluntary there had been no compulsion involved they argued that it would be inimical to the right and freedom of a democratic society were a journalist unable to disclose criminal wrongdoing to the police or the police unable to rely on voluntary disclosure made by journalist moreover in their view there wa no freestanding right of anonymity for a source under the convention the protection afforded by article in this respect wa accorded only to the journalist accordingly the government submitted the disclosure of the applicant name to the police did not engage article the applicant argued that the right of a source not to be identified by a journalist wa a necessary corollary of the right of the journalist not to disclose the source and therefore an inseparable element of the protection afforded by article by asking for and receiving information about his identity the police had acted incompatibly with his article right moreover the disclosure by mgn had not been truly voluntary since the company had acted under pressure to avoid a corporate prosecution he argued that the disclosure of his name without any prior review of the proposed disclosure by an independent body amounted to an interference with his right to speak out but remain anonymousd the court assessment in the absence of a court order compelling disclosure of the applicant identity the court must examine whether the complaint is compatible ratione persona with the provision of the convention within the meaning of article a of the convention the applicant position wa that the disclosure by mgn wa not voluntary but resulted from improper pressure from the police and wa therefore akin to the compelled disclosure by the state of his name a a journalistic source the court can not accept this argument a the court of appeal pointed out the reference by the trial judge to the motivation of mgn in assisting the police can not be equated to a finding that pressure wa put on mgn to disclose the applicant name see paragraph above even though the mo u did not expressly refer to article it term allowed mgn to refuse to disclose information on article ground including the right to protect journalistic source see paragraph and above mgn enjoyed access to legal advice and a the court of appeal found it is inconceivable that they did not give careful consideration to whether to make disclosure to the police in the context of the publicity which operation elveden and the leveson inquiry were attracting in these circumstance the court accepts the finding of the court of appeal that the disclosure wa truly voluntary see paragraph above in the absence of any compulsion on mgn to disclose the applicant name the applicant ha failed to demonstrate that the disclosure wa attributable to the respondent state in particular it can not be said that merely by requesting the information agreeing an mo u or accepting receipt of the information the police interfered with the applicant article right the applicant complaint concerning the disclosure of his information is accordingly incompatible ratione persona with the provision of the convention and must be declared inadmissible pursuant to article a the prosecution and conviction of the applicant admissibility in imparting information to the journalist in this case the applicant could assert his right to freedom of expression his prosecution and conviction for disclosing the information amounted to an interference with his article right the court is therefore of the opinion that the complaint raise sufficiently complex issue of fact and law so that it can not be rejected a manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention and is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible meritse the party submissionsi the applicant the applicant argued that the decision to prosecute him and to refuse his application for abuse of process and no case to answer violated his article right given the circumstance of the disclosure of his name to the police he contended that the offence wa vague and his prosecution on the basis of his action had not been foreseeable at the time he carried them out he also argued that there had been a clear public interest in the information he had provided and that disclosure of the information had not been harmful he claimed that he had taken step to raise his public interest concern at the prison on numerous occasion but that no action had been taken causing him to finally resort to providing information to a journalist to highlight these important issue he disputed that the information had been received by him in confidence or that it disclosure had been harmful he underlined the chilling effect that the prosecution and conviction had had on freedom of expression his treatment would leave source concerned that without more their identity could be disclosed to the police by journalist and discourage them from contacting the mediaii the government the government submitted that any interference because of the applicant prosecution or his conviction had been justified under article the criminal offence of misconduct in public office wa accessible and foreseeable and thus prescribed by law for the reason advanced in respect of the article complaint see paragraph above any interference wa also necessary in a democratic society in the interest of public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others and for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence the government pointed out that the applicant had committed a serious offence and that the information he had provided had been principally received in confidence consisting to a large extent of private information about prisoner and staff obtained in the course of his duty it disclosure had had a harmful impact on staff and prisoner and a negative effect on safety security and order within the prison it had also been in flagrant breach of duty the public interest in free speech had been carefully considered at each stage of the process the mo u had allowed mgn to withhold the information on public interest ground the decision to prosecute had been reviewed by the cps in the light of emerging clarification from the court of appeal a to the public interest defence available and public interest wa a defence to the charge itself which would have resulted in the applicant acquittal had it been made out the applicant had been prosecuted and convicted precisely because his conduct did not fall within this defence the jury verdict represented a finding of fact that the applicant conduct had not been in the public interestf the court assessmenti general principle article expressly protects the freedom to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority the necessity of any restriction on freedom of expression must be convincingly established it is for the national authority to ass in the first place whether there is a pressing social need for the restriction and in making their assessment they enjoy a certain margin of appreciation see goodwin v the united kingdom march report of judgment and decision ii the court task in exercising it supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authority but rather to review the case a a whole in the light of article and consider whether the decision taken by the national authority fell within their margin of appreciation the court must therefore look at the interference and determine whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it were relevant and sufficient ibid it is clear from the court caselaw that freedom of expression is of particular relevance to the press whose duty it is to impart in a manner consistent with it obligation and responsibility information and idea on all matter of public interest see bédat v switzerland gc no march accordingly the safeguard to be afforded to the press a part of it right to freedom of expression are of particular importance see sanoma uitgevers bv v the netherlands gc no september and goodwin cited above the court ha explained that the most careful scrutiny under article is required where measure or sanction imposed on the press are capable of discouraging the participation of the press in debate on matter of legitimate public concern see bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii and time newspaper ltd v the united kingdom no and no and echr accordingly a particularly narrow margin of appreciation will normally be accorded where the remark concern a matter of public interest see bédat cited above furthermore the court ha confirmed that under article the signalling by an employee in the public sector of illegal conduct or wrongdoing in the workplace should in certain circumstance enjoy protection this is particularly true where the employee concerned is the only person or part of a small category of people aware of what is happening at work and is thus best placed to act in the public interest by alerting the employer or the public at large see guja v moldova gc no echr and goryaynova v ukraine no october in such circumstance the court must enquire into whether there existed any alternative channel or other effective mean for the applicant to remedy the alleged wrongdoing such a disclosure to the person superior or other competent authority or body which the applicant intended to uncover see guja cited above ii application of the general principle to the fact of the case the court ha no doubt that the prosecution and conviction of the applicant were prescribed by law within the meaning of article it ha already found that the offence for which he wa prosecuted wa sufficiently clear and foreseeable in the circumstance of his case see paragraph above the court further accepts that the prosecution and conviction of the applicant pursued the aim cited by the government namely the interest of public safety the prevention of disorder or crime the protection of health or moral the protection of the reputation or right of others and the prevention of the disclosure of information received in confidence a to whether the applicant prosecution and conviction were necessary in a democratic society the court note that the applicant conduct spanned a period of five year over the course of which he provided story in exchange for payment on forty occasion this conduct wa a the trial judge concluded in flagrant breach of the rule which applied to him a a prison officer and constituted a very serious breach of trust see paragraph above the applicant did not dispute before the court of appeal a the trial judge had found that he wa aware of the rule and he accepted that his conduct had amounted to a disciplinary offence see paragraph above there can therefore be no doubt that the applicant knowingly engaged in a course of conduct contrary to the requirement of his public office and that the scope and scale of his unlawful conduct wa significant the court also attache significant weight in this context to the serious harm caused to other prisoner to staff and to public confidence in the prison service a a result of the applicant behaviour see paragraph above there wa therefore a strong public interest in prosecuting him in order to maintain the integrity and efficacy of the prison service and the public confidence in it on the other hand the domestic court noted that there wa no public interest in the majority of the information disclosed by the applicant nor had he been primarily motivated by publicinterest concern in his sentencing remark the judge recorded the applicant own concession in evidence that on a number of occasion he had disclosed information when the public interest had had nothing at all to do with what he wa disclosing see paragraph above the judge found a fact that the applicant had been motivated by money and by an intense dislike of the prison governor see paragraph above the court of appeal having set out the article for which the applicant had been the source and after careful consideration of the nature of those article likewise noted that there wa no public interest in the disclosure see paragraph above since the applicant moreover did not claim before this court to have acted a a whistleblower a defined in the court caselaw see paragraph above there is no need for the court to enquire into the kind of issue which ha been central in the above caselaw on whistleblowing namely whether there existed any alternative channel or other effective mean for the applicant to remedy the alleged wrongdoing which the applicant intended to uncover compare guja cited above the court would nonetheless observe in this respect that the sentencing judge pointed to the fact that a a tradeunion representative the applicant could have used official channel to disseminate information had public interest been his sole concern see paragraph above in conclusion the reason for the applicant prosecution and conviction were relevant and sufficient and no violation of article is disclosed for these reason the court unanimouslydeclares the complaint under article and the complaint under article in so far a it concern the applicant prosecution and conviction admissible declares the remainder of the application inadmissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention hold that there ha been no violation of

at the góis territorial post on november the applicant sent an email to the general inspectorate of internal administration inspecção geral da administração interna on the subject suspected misuse of money in which he made reference to an alleged misuse of money by commander mc of the arganil territorial post in accordance with what he had heard in a conversation with colleague at the arganil territorial post he asked the general inspectorate to investigate the alleged fact stating a follows in the month of december the coimbra national republican guard territorial group distributed money to the territorial post of it area of command for the christmas dinner the only member of the military in arganil who attended the dinner were the commander of the post and corporal m the total amount of money that had been given to the military from the territorial post to pay for the dinner wa paid to the restaurant manager in exchange for a receipt it seems that the commander ha since then been going with his family to the mentioned restaurant where the cost of his meal is deducted from the money that wa not spent on the above dinner note i have just become aware of this matter through rumour within the military of the mentioned post who claim that they have not reported the situation for fear of reprisal and because of that fear of reprisal i ask you for secrecy during the investigation because i am also a member of the military on an unknown date the general inspectorate of internal administration forwarded the email to the general command of the national republican guard comando geral da guarda nacional republicana and to the lousã public prosecutor office ministério público on an unknown date the lousã public prosecutor office opened an investigation into the applicant allegation on february the lousã public prosecutor office discontinued the proceeding on the ground that following investigation by the criminal investigation police policía judiciária it had found no evidence of the criminal offence denounced by the applicant the general inspectorate of internal administration also conducted an inquiry into the applicant allegation on june the inquiry wa discontinued the general command of the national republican guard also started an internal inquiry into the allegation on december on december commander mc wa heard in that respect he then became aware of the email of november and it content on february the inquiry wa converted into disciplinary proceeding against commander mc at the request of the official in charge of the inquiry on the ground that the management of the cafeteria of the arganil territorial post showed sign of lack of transparency which required further investigation on july the disciplinary proceeding against commander mc were discontinued on the ground that there wa insufficient evidence to take disciplinary action the decision to discontinue the disciplinary proceeding also took into account the decision of the lousã public prosecutor office to discontinue the criminal proceeding against commander mcb criminal proceeding against the applicant on april commander mc lodged a criminal complaint before the lousã public prosecutor office accusing the applicant of defamation he alleged that the applicant email had disseminated injurious statement about him on july the public prosecutor brought charge acusação against the applicant for aggravated defamation on the ground that the statement made in his email called into question commander mc honesty honour and professional reputation which the

applicant of aggravated defamation and sentenced him to eighty dayfines totalling eur euro the applicant wa also ordered to pay eur in damage to commander mc the court described it finding of fact and the manner in which it had assessed the evidence and held a follows since the existence of such a rumor ha not been proved in any way the court is fully convinced that the defendant intention wa to undermine the honour of the offended party once he knew that this wa just a rumour and that therefore he wa making an allegation that wa not true the allegation made in the defendant complaint by it content put into question the offended party honesty honour and professional reputation a commander of a territorial post of the national republican guard which wa well known to the defendant the defendant ha therefore acted in a free voluntary and conscious way with the achieved aim of attacking the offended party honour and personal and professional reputation the disclosure of irregular situation ha to be seen a a duty a the performance of an obligation when it fall within the competence and responsibility of the whistleblower and when it doe not go beyond the fact which were effectively observed whistleblowing can not be used a a basis to cast suspicion which can not be supported by any factual element in the instant case the defendant accuses the offended party of fact which are objectively dishonorable without having any evidence to substantiate them indeed by submitting that the offended party and his family were using the existing credit to have dinner at the mentioned restaurant the defendant knew that he wa accusing the offended party of a dishonorable deed all the more because he knew that the offended party wa in charge of the national republican guard arganil territorial post he further knew that the allegation wa inconsistent with the truth and that he could easily have clarified it authenticity with the restaurant owner through such conduct the defendant acted of his own free will and in the knowledge that his action were not allowed on an unknown date the applicant appealed against the judgment to the coimbra court of appeal in particular he contested the established fact a in his opinion he had not acted with the intention of attacking commander mc honour and reputation on september the coimbra court of appeal upheld the firstinstance court decision it considered that there were no reason to change the fact established by the firstinstance court and a such no reason to reach a different conclusion with regard to the applicant guilt and conviction c disciplinary proceeding against the applicant on august the general command of the national republican guard instituted disciplinary proceeding against the applicant on february the official in charge of the inquiry within the disciplinary proceeding against the applicant submitted a final report in which he concluded that the applicant had breached his duty the relevant passage of the report read a follows the defendant breached the duty of loyalty a being on duty and being part of the góis territorial post in the quality of deputy commander of the post he did not inform his hierarchical superior in clear disregard of the functional hierarchy principle of the act allegedly committed in the report it wa also taken into account that the applicant allegation had been investigated by different authority all of which had discontinued their investigation additionally it had regard to the fact that the applicant had been convicted by the domestic court in the criminal proceeding against him the report further analysed the existence of a fine which commander mc had imposed on the applicant before the latter had sent the impugned email however the official responsible for the report considered that fact to be innocuous and irrelevant on march at the request of the official responsible for the disciplinary proceeding the general command imposed on the applicant a disciplinary sanction consisting of suspension from duty for six day it enforcement being suspended for a period of twelve month according to the material submitted in the case file it seems that the applicant did not lodge an appeal against the disciplinary sanction with the minister of home affair ii relevant domestic lawa relevant provision of the portuguese criminal code article

similar written statement ensure that it is sent to the competent authority and always through the hierarchical channel the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained under article and of the convention that his conviction by the domestic court for aggravated defamation had infringed his right to freedom of expression the court being master of the characterisation to be given in law to the fact of the case will consider this complaint solely under article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court note that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission the applicant submitted that his right to freedom of expression had been breached in that he had been convicted for denouncing an alleged misuse of public money within the national republican guard he maintained that he had acted in good faith in disclosing the suspicion of alleged misuse of money a the veracity of the rumour could only be proved by mean of an investigation the only reason for his disclosure wa to have the alleged fact investigated the applicant acknowledged that he could have used the existing channel within the internal hierarchy of the national republican guard to make the disclosure however he contended that the disclosure wa made by email to an authority which had competence within the ministry of home affair to investigate the alleged fact a such he had complied with the chain of command he concluded that demanding that the disclosure of information be made only within the hierarchy of the general republican guard would limit freedom of expression referring to the case of heinisch v germany no echr the government contended that the protection of the workplace afforded by article of the convention could be guaranteed only when a disclosure of information wa made in good faith and favoured the internal channel of disclosure they considered that the allegation reported by the applicant could have been an issue of public interest given that the alleged misuse of public money wa at stake however the applicant allegation were based on a rumour which wa none the le investigated by three different entity and not proved the government submitted that the duty of loyalty wa particularly binding on serviceman in the national republican guard who were subject to special duty arising from the disciplinary regulation to which they were bound the applicant wa subject to a chain of command and should have disclosed the allegation to his hierarchical superior namely the commander of his territorial post or the commander of the territorial unit there were internal channel of disclosure which where used had been proven effective lastly the government submitted that past event the fact that the applicant had allegedly been fined by commander mc and that there wa a poor relationship between commander mc and the serviceman working at the arganil territorial post could lead to suspicion that the applicant may have felt some animosity towards commander mc the court assessment it ha not been disputed that the applicant conviction by the domestic court for aggravated defamation constituted interference by the public authority with his right to freedom of expression under the first paragraph of article of the convention such interference will constitute a breach of article unless it wa prescribed by law pursued one or more legitimate aim under paragraph and wa necessary in a democratic society for the achievement of those aim the court observes that the applicant conviction wa based on article and article of the portuguese criminal code and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting commander mc reputation it remains to be ascertained whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society a the principle established by the court caselaw the court reiterates that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfillment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society a set forth in article this freedom is subject to exception which must however be constructed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly the general principle for assessing the necessity of an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression have been summarised recently in pentikäinen v finland gc no echr and bédat v switzerland gc no march the court further reiterates that the protection of article of the convention extends to the workplace in general and to the public service in particular see among other authority guja v moldova gc no february furthermore under the court caselaw the signaling by an employee in the public sector of illegal conduct or wrongdoing in the workplace should in certain circumstance enjoy protection this may be called for where the employee concerned is the only person or part of a small category of person aware of what is happening at work and is thus best placed to act in the public interest by alerting the employer or the public at large see guja cited above and heinisch v germany no july the court is at the same time mindful that employee owe to their employer a duty of loyalty reserve and discretion in the light of these duty disclosure should be made in the first place to the person superior or other competent authority or body it is only where this is clearly impracticable that the information can a a last resort be disclosed to the public in assessing whether the restriction on freedom of expression wa proportionate the court must therefore take into account whether the applicant had any other effective mean of remedying the wrongdoing which he or she intended to uncover see guja cited above heinisch cited above the court also reiterates that when it is called upon to rule on a conflict between two right that are equally protected by the convention it must weight up the interest at stake the state is called upon to guarantee both right and if the protection of one lead to an interference with the other to choose adequate mean to make this interference proportionate to the aim pursued in this context the court accepts that the state ha a wide margin of appreciation see fernández martínez v spain gc no echr in the present case the court must ascertain whether the domestic authority struck a fair balance between on the one hand the applicant right to freedom of expression under article and on the other the protection of reputation of commander mc a right which a an aspect of private life is protected by article of the convention see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no november in this regard the court task is not to take the place of the national court but rather to review under article in the light of the case a a whole the decision they have taken pursuant to their discretionary power see stankiewicz and others v poland no no november b application of the above principle to the present case turning to the fact of the present case the court agrees with the government position that the applicant allegation could concern an important question of public interest the possible misuse of public money by a civil servant see paragraph above it note that the defamation claim originated in the applicant correspondence with the general inspectorate of internal administration which forwarded the applicant email to the general command of the national republican guard and to the lousã public prosecutor office in his email the applicant alleged that commander mc had been misusing public money he claimed that his intention wa to prompt an investigation into the allegation which he admitted were based on a rumour see paragraph above in order to ass the justification of a statement which is in issue a distinction must be made between statement of fact and value judgment while the existence of fact can be demonstrated the requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself which is a fundamental part of the right secured by article see among other authority pinto pinheiro marque v portugal no january the court considers that in the present case the applicant allegation constituted a statement of fact for a civil servant working for a lawenforcement authority the accusation that he misused public money wa a particularly serious one capable of affecting his reputation and to an even larger extent that of the national republican guard thus even if the applicant had intended to prompt an investigation he had to have a factual basis on which to base his allegation however he based his allegation on a mere rumour and had no evidence to support them the court therefore concludes that the domestic court finding that he had not acted in good faith see paragraph above wa proportional and justified in this regard the situation differs from that examined by the court in the case bargão and domingo correia v portugal no and where the applicant believed that the information disclosed wa true and were able to prove it ibid in fact the applicant knowing that his allegation were based on a rumour made no attempt to verify their authenticity before reporting them to the general inspectorate of internal administration the court note that the applicant had no evidence to support his allegation and that none of the three different entity which investigated them were able to establish their veracity additionally none of the three entity established that commander mc had committed a criminal act or had acted unlawfully see paragraph above the court further note that in the criminal proceeding against the applicant the domestic court were not able to establish the existence of the rumour which had given rise to the applicant allegation see paragraph above a to the addressee of the disclosure the court observes that the applicant wa aware that he had internal channel within the hierarchy of the national republican guard to which he could have reported the rumour namely a pointed out by the government the commander of his territorial post or the commander of the territorial unit see paragraph above notwithstanding that he did not convincingly explain why he did not disclose the allegation to a superior by not doing so the applicant did not comply with the chain of command and denied his hierarchical superior the opportunity to investigate the veracity of the allegation in the light of the above the instant case ha therefore to be distinguished from case of justified information of the superior or whistleblowing an action warranting special protection under article of the convention compare with guja and heinisch both cited above finally a regard the proportionality of the sanction the court note that the applicant wa ordered to pay a fine of dayfines eur plus eur in damage to commander mc those amount appear very moderate taking into account the gravity of the applicant allegation the harm caused to mc and the fact that the applicable maximum fine wa daysfine according to article and of the criminal code therefore the sanction imposed can not be found disproportionate having regard to the above consideration the court considers that the reason advanced by the domestic court in support of their decision were relevant and sufficient and that the interference wa not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued namely the protection of reputation the interference could thus be reasonably considered necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of paragraph of article of the convention therefore the court see no serious reason to substitute it own assessment for that of the domestic court which examined the question at issue with care and in line with the principle laid down by the court caselaw accordingly there ha been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the application admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on june pursuant to rule and of the rule of court marialena tsirli andrás sajóregistrar president,,,

county a he wa in italy the employee of the suceava county police inspectorate promptly informed me that there had been a mistake and that the general search for my son had been called off the document confirming this information is available to the public from the suceava judicial service my wish would be to have the article retracted this letter wa published in the newspaper on august b firstinstance proceeding on september sa lodged with the suceava district court a criminal complaint against the applicant for the offence of defamation a prescribed at the time by article of the romanian criminal code after explaining that at the time of the theft he wa in italy and thus it wa impossible for him to have participated in the alleged offence he mentioned that once his father had

newspaper that the fact published about his son were false the newspaper did not publish a retraction of the article written by the defendant c appeal proceeding by a final judgment of january the suceava county court rejected an appeal by the applicant and upheld the firstinstance court judgment the court stated in it reasoning the following even though there is no men rea a far a the offence of defamation provided for in article of the criminal code is concerned given the source of information at the date of the publishing of the article the defendant obligation to pay compensation to the civil party can not be set aside this is because following the discovery of the error he did not publish a retraction in order to try to rectify it the article caused nonpecuniary damage to the civil party which can be repaired only in the manner established by the firstinstance court ii relevant domestic law the relevant provision of the civil and criminal code concerning insult and defamation

inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission the government accepted that the court decision rendered against the applicant constituted interference with his right to freedom of expression but argued that the interference wa provided for by law notably article of the criminal code and of the civil code and had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the victim reputation the government further argued that the issue raised by this case wa the failure of the applicant and the newspaper to publish any rectification or retraction concerning the disputed article once they became aware pending the criminal proceeding started by sa against the applicant that the police had provided erroneous information and that the general search order had been revoked in their view in line with the reasoning of the domestic court the publication of the letter written by sa father did not qualify a a proper rectification in so far a it had been afforded only very limited space in the newspaper and the reader could not have made a connection between the first article and the letter furthermore since the applicant had not provided any explanation for his omission to publish an appropriate rectification the government contended that he could not be considered to have acted in good faith the government further pointed out that the civil sanction imposed on the applicant by the court were proportionate the applicant reiterated that when publishing the disputed article he had relied in good faith on official information which he had had no obligation or possibility of verifying he cited selistö v finland no november and colombani and others v france no echr v and the article had not included any value judgment nor any personal opinion concerning the criminal liability of sathe applicant further argued that by publishing sa father letter only a few day after the publication of the defamatory article and in so far a the letter contained explicit detail sufficient to clarify the situation of the aggrieved party the obligation to rectify the article had been fulfilled he further claimed that the relevant romanian legislation wa not very precise in defining what form an appropriate retraction would take therefore the domestic court conclusion that he had failed to publish a retraction were ungrounded and arbitrary the applicant further submitted that by publishing the impugned article he contributed to the clarification of sa situation in so far a had it not been for the article the general search warrant issued by mistake would have still been maintained the applicant estimated that in such circumstance it wa the police and the investigative authority who were responsible for the moral damage sustained by salastly the applicant contended that the obligation imposed on him by the domestic court to pay nonpecuniary damage of approximately euro eur had been excessive in view of his monthly revenue at the relevant time of about eur and thus had a significant chilling effect the court assessment the court note that the party agree that there had been an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression it is further satisfied that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protection of the right of others namely of sa right to reputation it remains to be ascertained whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic societya general principle the court general principle on the application of the requirement in article of the convention that any interference must be necessary in a democratic society were restated recently in perinçek v switzerland gc no october a followsii the adjective necessary in article implies the existence of a pressing social need the high contracting party have a margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the law and the decision that apply it even those given by independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction can be reconciled with freedom of expressioniii the court task is not to take the place of the competent national authority but to review the decision that they made under article this doe not mean that the court supervision is limited to ascertaining whether these authority exercised their discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith the court must rather examine the interference in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it were relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that these authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact the nature and severity of the sanction imposed are factor to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference a the court ha previously pointed out interference with freedom of expression may have a chilling effect on the exercise of that freedom the relatively moderate nature of the fine do not suffice to negate the risk of a chilling effect on the exercise of freedom of expression see morice v france gc no april although the press must not overstep certain bound regarding in particular protection of the reputation and right of others it duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with it obligation and responsibility information and idea on all matter of public interest thus the duty of imparting information necessarily includes duty and responsibility a well a limit which the press must impose on itself of it own accord see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no november in this respect the court reiterates that the protection afforded by article of the convention to journalist is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenet of responsible journalism this concept pertains to inter alia the content of information which is collected andor disseminated by journalistic mean in this context journalist who exercise their freedom of expression undertake duty and responsibility it will be recalled in this connection that paragraph of article doe not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to medium coverage of matter of serious public concern see mutatis mutandis pentikäinen v finland gc no october and the caselaw cited therein the court further reiterates that a legal obligation to publish a retraction or a reply is a normal element of the legal framework governing the exercise of freedom of expression by the print medium and it can not a such be regarded a excessive or unreasonable such an obligation make it possible for example for the person who feel aggrieved by a press article to present his or her reply in a manner compatible with the editorial practice of the newspaper concerned see kaperzyński v poland no april lastly in case which require the right to respect for private life to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression the court considers that the outcome of the application should not in theory vary according to whether it ha been lodged with the court under article of the convention by the person who wa the subject of the news report or under article by the publisher indeed a a matter of principle these right deserve equal respect accordingly the margin of appreciation should in theory be the same in both case see among many other authority couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above b application of those principle to the present case the court note at the outset that in the case at hand the applicant reported on a matter of public concern that is to say the criminal investigation of a theft for which the suspect wa wanted throughout the country and for which he allegedly attempted to avoid prosecution by fleeing a this information proved to have been erroneous and defamatory and in so far a no proper retraction wa published criminal proceeding were lodged against the applicant for defamation at the request of the aggrieved party sahowever the domestic court ultimately cleared the applicant of the charge of defamation in so finding they relied on the fact that the information published had been provided by official source specifically by the judicial service a department of the local police this authority confirmed before the court that at the time of publication the fact presented in the article had been accurate in the sense that at that time sa had been wanted an order which had been revoked at a date subsequent to the publication of the article see paragraph above noting that the men rea wa found to be missing the domestic court considered that the applicant wa responsible for the damage caused to the third party by the publication of the article in so doing the court referred to the fact that a retraction should have been published once the applicant had become aware of the error contained in the article the court would refer to the circumstance of the case a reflected in paragraph above noting that the letter of sa father pointing out the error committed in respect of his son wa promptly published in the newspaper however in spite of the explicit request that a retraction be published in the newspaper this wa never done referring to the newspaper failure to publish the necessary retraction sa filed the abovementioned criminal complaint in which he requested that the applicant be punished in criminal proceeding and ordered to pay civil damage see paragraph above in this context the court note that the pertinent domestic legislation doe not clearly lay out the term for an appropriate retraction thus leaving the matter at the discretion of the editor initially and ultimately of the judge see paragraph above it is in these circumstance that the applicant argued that the prompt publication of the letter written by sa father constituted an appropriate retraction however the court note that the domestic court argument for rejecting the applicant defence and ordering the payment of nonpecuniary damage to sa focused mainly on the fact he did not publish a retraction once he had become aware of the defamatory information see paragraph above while considering it regrettable that the domestic court did not give more detail thereto the court can not ignore the fact that the applicant ha never confirmed or made it clear in the newspaper that the impugned information previously published wa indeed erroneous and defamatory not even after the respective error wa officially acknowledged by the judicial service of the local police on october thus more than one month prior to the delivery of the first instance judgment see paragraph and above in fact it wa the applicant constant submission both before the domestic court and before this court see paragraph and above that by publishing the letter written by sa father his obligation to retract had been fully complied with furthermore the court considers that there is nothing in the case file to suggest that the applicant may have attempted to publish a proper retraction but wa prevented by the editor to do so see also paragraph above while reiterating the importance of the right of a person who feel aggrieved by a press article to a rectification with a corresponding obligation on the journalist or newspaper the court considers that in the present case the applicant ha failed to act in accordance with the principle governing journalistic ethic requiring of him to clearly and explicitly correct any published information which ha proved to be erroneous or defamatory furthermore looking into the severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant specifically the obligation to pay nonpecuniary damage of approximately eur the court considers that such an obligation doe not appear excessive in view both of it amount and of the fact that the newspaper is bound to pay it jointly with the applicant therefore in the overall circumstance of the instant case the court find that the solution of the domestic court struck a fair balance between the competing interest of the claimant and those of the applicant and the reason given to justify their decision were relevant and sufficient and met a pressing social need the court also ha regard to the award of damage made against the applicant in the context of a civil action and did not find it to be disproportionate therefore the court doe not see any serious reason to substitute it own assessment for that of the domestic court which examined the question at issue in line with the principle laid down by the court caselaw see mutatis mutandis medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina no october there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court declares unanimously the application admissible hold by five vote to two that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on march pursuant to rule and of the rule of court fatoş aracıandrás sajódeputy registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the separate opinion of judge sajó and tsotsoria is annexed to this judgment asfa joint dissenting opinion of judgessajó and tsotsoriato our regret we have to disagree with our colleague in the majority we take the view that the applicant article right were violated in this case on august the applicant a journalist published an article concerning a police investigation on the basis of information which he had received from the police about sa being suspected of aggravated theft and of absconding following the publication of the article sa father sent a letter to the newspaper in the letter the father stated that his son wa out of the country and that the police had informed him that there had been a mistake and the search had been called off in the letter the father claimed that the document confirming this information wa available at the judicial service furthermore the father requested the article retraction the letter wa published three day after the original publication of the article on september a the journalist had taken no further action sa lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant for criminal defamation thirtytwo day later on october the police informed the local court that the search order had been revoked on september that is to say after the publication of the father letter the applicant wa held liable for civil defamation the domestic court attached importance to the fact that although the injured party father had notified the newspaper that the fact published about his son were false the newspaper had not published a retraction of the article written by the defendant this consideration wa held by the court to show that the applicant had failed to correct the erroneous and defamatory information while we disagree with the judgment primarily because we find that the court ha departed from it clear caselaw that protects freedom of expression and journalism we have disagreement with regard to the reconstruction of the fact and also to the domestic proceeding in particular we find that the injured party father wa immediately granted the right to reply although he wa not a directly concerned party and apparently had no power of attorney moreover it is unclear whether under section of the press act a defamed person is entitled to request both reply and retraction thirdly at the time of the nonspecific request for retraction the search had not been called off there wa nothing to retract the search wa called off later and this wa not known to the applicant until the police provided the information during the criminal proceeding the plaintiff never provided the relevant official information that could have served a a basis for retraction the court itself accepts that at the time it wa written the fact presented in the article were accurate the court claim however that the court referred to the fact that a retraction should have been published once the applicant had become aware of the error contained in the article we do not find such a limited approach in the domestic judgment quoted where the main reference is to the notification by the father at the time of that notification a the present judgment clearly state the contested information wa correct moreover the plaintiff in the domestic proceeding at no point requested rectification even though he had thirty day to avail himself of that remedy instead he asked for damage for the defamation contained in the original publication which informed about the position of the police the injured party initiated an action for damage a the original publication had allegedly damaged his reputation during the proceeding it wa shown that the police made a mistake the injured party did not alter his plea and did not request rectification nevertheless the journalist wa ordered to pay damage for reputational injury for what he had failed to do during the proceeding where he had not even been asked to act in any given manner furthermore we also entertain serious doubt about the assumption that journalist have a duty of rectification whenever they become aware of an error in their article especially if that error is not of their making such a duty is even more problematic in the absence of any request for a rectification when the error becomes known if it really is an error on the part of the journalist a very big if in this case however our major concern is that the judgment which seems to endorse the abovementioned position departs from the clear caselaw of this court in the present case the court allegedly relies on a concept of responsible journalism with reference mutatis mutandis to pentikäinen v finland gc no october and the caselaw cited therein more specifically the court refers to the duty of the journalist or newspaper to enable a defamed person to present his or her reply in a manner compatible with the editorial practice of the newspaper concerned see kaperziński v poland no april needle to say in the present case the right of reply wa allowed so the kaperziński requirement of responsible journalism wa satisfied but perhaps there is something else in the general principle of pentikäinen even if it is quoted without going into specific mutatis mutandis that justifies the nonviolation of article the caselaw cited in pentikäinen is bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii fressoz and roire v france gc no and so on fressoz and roire read a follows in essence that article article leaf it for journalist to decide whether or not it is necessary to reproduce such document to ensure credibility it protects journalist right to divulge information on issue of general interest provided that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the ethic of journalism see in particular the goodwin judgment cited above p the schwabe v austria judgment of august series a no b p and a an example of a finding to the contrary on the fact prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no p it is true that pentikäinen us a formula that may be seen a a slight and most unfortunate departure from the traditional position of this court in matter of journalistic responsibility the court also reiterates that the protection afforded by article of the convention to journalist is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenet of responsible journalism see mutatis mutandis bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc cited above fressoz and roire v france gc no etc pentikäinen also add a new element not taken into consideration by the court and not even cited in the present case namely the lawfulness of the journalist behaviour the fact that a journalist ha breached the law in that connection is a most relevant albeit not decisive consideration when determining whether he or she ha acted responsibly there can be no doubt that there is no issue with regard to this most relevant consideration the journalist acted lawfully it is undeniable that the text of fressoz and roire is not fully reproduced in pentikäinen the relevance of an accurate factual basis wa omitted and in accordance with the ethic of journalism wa replaced with tenet of responsible journalism this is regrettable especially a there are no reason given but in the absence of a specific statement to the contrary and in view of the direct reference to the earlier text of the leading case we see no reason to assume that the previous standard and caselaw have been abandoned or reinterpreted in any way or sense the role of the court remains the same it ha toexamine whether the journalist who wrote the impugned article acted in good faith and in accordance with the ethic of the profession of journalist in the court view this depends in particular on the nature and degree of the defamation at hand the manner in which the impugned article wa written and the extent to which the applicant newspaper could reasonably regard it source a reliable with respect to the allegation in question the latter issue must be determined in light of the situation a it presented itself to the journalist at the material time rather than with the benefit of hindsight see bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above flux v moldova no no july there can be no question about the good faith of the article which provided reliable information on the search and the reason it wa carried out this is correct factual information the only thing added to the information is that it ha assumed that the wanted person wa a fugitive this wa a logical conclusion drawn from the suspect absence in order to describe the legal situation journalism is not stenography if such comment are not allowed official press communique will replace the press the source the police wa to be considered reliable in the most controversial flux v moldova no judgment even the majority would have accepted that the publication of a reply is a measure complying with the responsibility dictated by journalistic ethic further the present case doe not involve someone being charged with criminal act in the absence of a factual basis at the material time see bladet tromsø and stensaas at the material time the information wa correct it accurately reported the fact of the police search the injured party could have asked the police for a rectification possibly at their own expense after the search had been called off arguably he could also have asked the newspaper after the cancellation of the search but he failed to do so even during the criminal procedure we can not see why it should be a matter of journalistic ethic to provide rectification ex officio and proprio motu where the police mistake come to the journalist attention in a criminal case against him of course we would have given thought to that possibility had the court given u reason to believe that such an obligation exists the bladet tromsø test requires u to consider the nature of the defamation it wa grave but inevitable and certainly not caused by the press which acted a a messenger in a matter of public interest note that the burglary had targeted the headquarters of a political party the majority position is even more surprising if one compare the fact and the reasoning in the present case with that of a number of judgment concerning romania see for all barb v romania no october and further caselaw cited there to our regret we observe time and again that the concept of responsible journalism in the present case in the framework of a non sequitur result in undermining freedom of the press and this case is no exception while there are responsibility attached to all professional activity when it come to the press the reference to responsible journalism is disturbing just a when the little adjective socialist wa added to democracy responsible journalism is far too often equated with selfcensorship or is perhaps used a a judicial tool to enforce selfcensorship we do not intend to use that tool the term responsible journalism wa used in in flux and samson v moldova no october to explain what is said in bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii it wa shorthand for judicial respect for journalistic ethic in stoll v switzerland gc no echr v it wa used to emphasise that there is no full immunity for journalist in the name of journalistic freedom in matter of criminal responsibility it seems that this idea wa transposed to responsibility in general and the fact that journalist can not claim unlimited protection in criminal case in the name of freedom of expression is now increasingly understood a imposing special duty on journalist in reporting in general in the civil context,,,

data by the operator of a search engine wa liable to affect significantly the fundamental right to privacy and to the protection of personal data a guaranteed under article and of the charter of fundamental right of the european union oj c when a search by mean of that engine wa carried out on the basis of an individual name since such processing enabled any internet user to obtain through the list of search result thus attained a structured overview of the information relating to that individual that could be found on the internet and thereby to establish a more or le detailed profile of him or her furthermore the effect of such interference on the right of a data subject would be heightened on account of the important role played by the internet and search engine in modern society which rendered the information contained in such a list of result ubiquitous in the light of the potential seriousness of that interference it could not be justified merely by the economic interest of the operator the cjeu held that a fair balance had to be sought between the legitimate interest of internet user in having access to such information and the data subject fundamental right it deemed that a data subject fundamental right a a general rule overrode the interest of internet user but that that balance might however depend on i the nature of the information in question and it sensitivity a regard the data subject private life and ii the interest of the public in having that information the cjeu held that in certain case the operator of a search engine wa obliged to remove from the list of result displayed following a search made on the basis of a person name any and all link to internet page published by third party and containing information relating to that person even when the publication of that information on the internet page in question wa in itself lawful that wa so in particular where the data in question appeared to be inadequate irrelevant or no longer

processing the european data protection board guideline on the criterion of the right to be forgotten in search engine case under the gdpr the guideline on the criterion of the right to be forgotten in the search engine case under the gdpr adopted by the european data protection board on july read a follows in their relevant part this document aim to interpret the right to be forgotten in the search engine case in light of the provision of article gdpr the right to request delisting indeed the right to be forgotten ha been especially enacted under article gdpr to take into account the right to request delisting established in the costeja judgement judgment of the cjeu of may in google spain and google c euc according to article a gdpr a data subject may request a search engine provider following a search carried out a a general rule on the basis of his or her name to delist content from it search result where the data subject personal data returned in those search result are no longer necessary in relation to the purpose of the processing by the search engine this provision enables a data subject to request the delisting of personal information concerning him or her that have been made accessible for longer than it is necessary for the search engine provider processing yet this processing is notably carried out for the purpose of making information more easily accessible for internet user within the context of the right to request delisting the balance between the protection of privacy and the interest of internet user in accessing the information must be undertaken in particular it must be assessed whether or not over the course of time the personal data have become outofdate or have not been updated the lawalleged violation of article of the convention under article of the convention the applicant alleged that the interference in his freedom of expression namely his right to inform the public had been unjustified he also complained that the penalty imposed on him had been excessive article of the convention read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the court note that the application is neither manifestly illfounded nor inadmissible on any other ground listed in article of the convention it must therefore be declared admissible merit the party submissionsa the applicant the applicant pointed out that the criminal proceeding instituted against vx had still been pending at the date on which the supreme court judgment had been issued in respect of his case therefore it could not be said that the period of time during which the information had remained published wa excessive thus vxs right to be forgotten had never existed in the first place the applicant submitted that the domestic authority had not taken into account article of legislative decree no which provided that the processing of personal data for inter alia historical research purpose scopi storici could be carried out upon the expiry of the period allowed for achieving the different purpose for which the data had originally been collected and processed he also referred to article and of the same decree and to the abovementioned code of ethic which contained specific provision regarding the protection of journalist freedom of expression the applicant further submitted that he had been unjustly held liable for not having erased the article in question since only the search engine provider that is to say google italy had been technically capable of delisting the article in question the applicant also pointed out that in case similar to the present one the balance between the protection of individual reputation under article and the freedom of expression provided by article had been easily secured by simply requiring the publication concerned to publish supplementary information or clarification to the article in questionb the government the government submitted that an adequate balance between the applicant freedom of expression and the right of vx and his restaurant to respect for his private life and the reputation of both had been achieved in the instant case the government added that the restriction in question had been prescribed by law namely legislative decree no which clearly stated that the maintenance of personal data wa subject to the continuing existence of the objective that had initially justified their collection and storage the aim of journalism namely to contribute to public debate on matter of social political and economic interest should be deemed to be ongoing whenever the knowledge of certain event wa still relevant to public discussion in that regard the government submitted that the article had remained on the website of the online newspaper for a substantial period of time indeed no information about the progress of the related criminal proceeding had been provided in the article which had simply recounted the material event the government emphasised that the fact that the applicant had been found guilty had been a consequence of the failure to deindex from the internet search engine the tag to the article published by the applicant which would have prevented anyone accessing the article by mean of simply typing out the name of vx or of his restaurant in other word the decision of the italian court had stated that the applicant should have deindexed the article content thereby making it more likely that only people who were genuinely interested in learning the fact of the matter in question would come across the article however the applicant had not been obliged actually to remove the article in question from the internet archive contrary to what the applicant had stated in his observation the government submitted that the obligation to deindex material could be imposed not only on internet search engine provider but also on the administrator of newspaper or journalistic archive accessible through the internetc thirdparty intervenersi reporter committee for freedom of the press this intervener reiterated that the right to be forgotten a recognised by the cjeu in google spain and google and a stipulated by the gdpr see respectively paragraph et seq and et seq above is aimed at providing user with the ability to request that search engine delist or deindex the result of search conducted on the basis of a person name within the convention system this right ha to be weighed against the right to freedom of expression and the right to publish information in particular when it would result in the permanent removal of news article published by the press see węgrzynowski and smolczewski v poland no july this thirdparty intervener also pointed out the essential role played by the press in a democratic society including through medium website and it establishment of digital archive it also pointed out that the court had found that the public right to be informed outweighed the right to be forgotten in the case of two individual who had sought to have online medium report about their past criminal conviction anonymised it referred to ml and ww v germany no and june ii un special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the special rapporteur for freedom of expression of the inter american commission on human right this thirdparty intervener argued that there wa a significant distinction between delisting and the outright erasure of content under international standard regarding freedom of expression the conclusion that the right to be forgotten encompassed the right to demand the erasure of certain news content a opposed to it mere delisting would almost certainly lead to censorship worldwide and the right to be forgotten would be inappropriately expanded to the extent of severely jeopardising press freedomiii medium lawyer association the medium lawyer association contended that online medium archive played a fundamental role in protecting and developing the right and value enshrined in article of the convention the erasure of accurate information from the record ran directly contrary to the value protected by article and amounted to press censorship accordingly any attempt to erase such information had to be genuinely exceptional and only justifiable where strictly necessaryiv medium legal defence initiative the medium legal defence initiative argued that the scope of the right to be forgotten should not include the right to secure the erasure or the anonymisation of newspaper article containing the personal information of individual in the interveners view article published by individual or entity engaged in journalistic activity or by government should not be delisted this third party also submitted that in the evaluation of the balance between the right to respect for one reputation and the right to freedom of expression other element came into play such a whether the complainant had suffered substantial harm how recent the information in question wa and whether it remained of interest to the public individual should not be empowered to restrict access to information concerning themselves and published by third party except when such information had an essentially private or defamatory character or when the publication of such information wa not justified for other reason the court assessmenta preliminary remarksi the scope of the case the court note at the outset that it ha dealt with article case concerning internet publication in which the subject matter wa an article or a post with defamatory or offensive content see delfi a v estonia gc no echr savva terentyev v russia no august and kablis v russia no and april moreover it ha previously examined the requirement to publish where appropriate supplementary information or clarification to an article contained in internet archive see time newspaper ltd v the united kingdom no and no and echr which concerned the requirement to append a notice to the article at stake in that case to the effect that they were subject to libel litigation with regard to article the court ha already examined case in which the domestic court refused to remove personal data from public internet archive see węgrzynowski and smolczewski cited above or to oblige medium to anonymise online archived material concerning a crime see ml and ww v germany cited above the court observes however that the present case diverges from all the article and case cited above it crux is indeed not related to the content of an internet publication nor to the way information is published a for instance it anonymisation or classification rather it relates to the applicant failure to deindex information concerning vx and his restaurant and to his decision to keep the article easily accessible despite the fact that the claimant had asked that the article be removed from the internet the scope of the case a defined above wa also emphasised by the supreme court which ruled out the possibility that the unlawfulness of the processing of vxs personal data arose from either i the content of the said article ii it online publication and dissemination or iii it conservation and digital archiving see paragraph above the court also note that what is at stake in the present case is the length and ease of access to the data concerned and not their mere retention on the internet in this regard the court observes that the applicant claimed that he could not be attributed responsibility for deindexing the article in question such a possibility being open in his view only to the relevant internet search engine provider the court note however that this assertion is contradicted by the fact that the applicant eventually did deindex the impugned article on may see paragraph above indeed deindexing can be carried out by an editor noindexing being a technique used by website owner to tell a search engine provider not to let the content of an article appear in the search engine search result in this respect the court share the government position that the finding of the applicant liability had been a consequence of the failure to deindex from the internet search engine the tag to the article published by the applicant which would have prevented anyone accessing it by simply typing out the name of vx or of his restaurant and that the obligation to deindex material could be imposed not only on internet search engine provider but also on the administrator of newspaper or journalistic archive accessible through the internet see paragraph and above the court will therefore keep in mind the scope of the case a described above a it now proceeds to examine the applicant complaintii relevant terminology the court acknowledges that the term deindexing delisting and dereferencing are often used interchangeably in different source of eu and international law and that their specific meaning can often only be drawn from the context in which they are used see paragraph above for recommendation cmrec of the council of europe committee of minister to member state on the protection of human right with regard to search engine in particular it part iii entitled filtering and deindexing point and the european data protection board guideline on the criterion of the right to be forgotten in search engine case under the gdpr in paragraph above and the cjeus judgment in gc and others dereferencing of sensitive data in paragraph above within the abovementioned source the term deindexing delisting and dereferencing indicate the activity of a search engine consisting of removing on the initiative of it operator from the list of result displayed following a search made on the basis of a person name internet page published by third party that contain information relating to that person see paragraph above instead in the instant case the subject to whom wa addressed the request to limit access to personal data namely the applicant wa not a search engine but an editor journalist and owner of an online newspaper website for the sake of consistency the court emphasis that in this judgment it will use the term deindexing to indicate the measure that the applicant wa asked to carry out in order to guarantee vxs and w right to respect for their reputationb the court assessment the court note that it wa not in dispute between the party that the applicant freedom of expression a guaranteed under article of the convention wa interfered with by the domestic court decision of january and june neither wa it in dispute between the party that such interference wa prescribed by law namely by legislative decree no of the court see no reason to hold otherwise furthermore it is satisfied that the interference in question wa intended to protect the reputation or right of others and thus pursued a legitimate aim under article of the convention a to the question whether the said interference wa necessary in a democratic society the court would draw attention at the outset to the specificity and scope of the case at issue see paragraph et seq above the applicant wa held liable not for failing to remove the article but for failing to deindex it thus allowing the possibility for a period whose length ha been deemed to be excessive of typing into the search engine the restaurant or vxs name in order to access information relating to the criminal proceeding involving vx in this connection and with reference to the above consideration concerning the scope of the case the court endorses the observation of the thirdparty interveners see paragraph et seq above which draw a clear distinction between on the one hand the requirement to delist or deindex a in the present case and on the other hand the permanent removal or erasure of news article published by the press in the instant case the court acknowledges that the applicant wa found to be liable solely on account of the first requirement that is to say no requirement to permanently remove the article wa at issue before the domestic court nor wa any intervention regarding the anonymisation of the online article in question at issue in this case in the court view this is an important startingpoint from which to define the interference with the applicant freedom of expression and to identify accordingly the applicable principle in order to ass the proportionality of that interference a to this last point the court ha laid down relevant principle to guide it assessment of whether or not an interference in this area is necessary and ha identified a number of criterion in the context of balancing freedom of expression against the right to reputation these criterion are the following i contribution to a debate of general interest ii the extent to which the person concerned is well known and the subject of the report in question iii the prior conduct of the person concerned towards the medium iv the method of obtaining the information in question and it veracity v the content form and consequence of the publication in question and vi the severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant see axel springer ag v germany gc no february however the court observes that there are factual difference between axel springer ag cited above and the present case the former case concerned the publication by the applicant company of print article reporting the arrest and conviction of a wellknown television actor whereas a noted above the present case deal with the retention online for a certain period of time of an internet article concerning a criminal case against private individual there are therefore two main feature that characterise the present case one is the period for which the online article remained on the internet and the impact thereof on the right of the individual in question to have his reputation respected the second feature relates to the nature of the data subject in question that is to say a private individual not acting within a public context a a political or public figure indeed anyone well known or not can be the subject of an internet search and his or her right can be impaired by continued internet access to his or her personal data in the light of the above the court acknowledges that the strict application of the criterion set out in axel springer ag cited above would be inappropriate in the present circumstance what the court must examine is whether in the light of the fundamental principle established in it caselaw the domestic court finding of civil liability on the part of the applicant wa based on relevant and sufficient ground given the particular circumstance of the case see among other authority time newspaper ltd and delfi a both cited above see also the more recent case of big brother watch and others v the united kingdom gc no and others et seq may special attention should be paid in this case to i the length of time for which the article wa kept online particularly in the light of the purpose for which vxs data wa originally processed ii the sensitiveness of the data at issue and iii the gravity of the sanction imposed on the applicant regarding the first point the court acknowledges that a pointed out by the applicant the criminal proceeding against vx and other member of his family were still pending at the time that the supreme court adopted it judgment in the applicant case however it should be noted that the information contained in the article had not been updated since the occurrence of the event in question moreover notwithstanding the formal notice that vx sent to the applicant requesting the removal of the article from the internet it remained online and wa easily accessible for eight month in this connection the applicable domestic law see article of legislative decree no read in the light of the international legal instrument see article e of the updated convention ets no quoted in paragraph above and article a of the gdpr quoted in paragraph above support the idea that the relevance of the applicant right to disseminate information decreased over the passage of time compared to vxs right to respect for his reputation in this connection compare and contrast éditions plon v france no echr iv where a time elapsed the public interest in discussing the history of president mitterrand time in office increasingly prevailed over any right with regard to medical confidentiality in that case the court considered in particular that in any event the duty of medical confidentiality had already been breached with regard to the sensitiveness of the data in question in the instant case the court is mindful that the subject matter of the article in question related to criminal proceeding instituted against vx a can also be seen from several council of europe and eu source article of the updated convention ets no see paragraph above and the judgment of the cjeu in google spain and google see paragraph above and in gc and others dereferencing of sensitive data see paragraph above the court is of the belief that the circumstance in which information concerning sensitive data is published constitutes a factor to be taken into account when balancing the right to disseminate information against the right of a data subject to respect for his or her private life concerning the gravity of the sanction the court reiterates that the applicant wa held liable under civil and not criminal law contrast tuomela and others v finland no april and savva terentyev cited above although the amount of compensation that the applicant wa ordered to pay to the claimant for the breach of their right to have their reputation respected wa not negligible the court is of the view that the severity of the sentence and the amount of compensation awarded in respect of nonpecuniary damage eur to each claimant can not be regarded a excessive given the circumstance of this case where the balancing exercise between on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for one private life a enshrined in article of the convention ha been carried out by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down by the court caselaw the court would require strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see among other authority palomo sánchez and others v spain gc no and others echr and delfi a cited above the foregoing consideration are sufficient to enable the court to conclude that the finding by the domestic court that the applicant had breached vxs right to respect for his reputation by virtue of the continued presence on the internet of the impugned article and by his failure to deindex it constituted a justifiable restriction of his freedom of expression see mutatis mutandis time newspaper ltd cited above all the more so a no requirement wa imposed on the applicant to permanently remove the article from the internet accordingly there ha been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimouslydeclares the application admissible find that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on november pursuant to rule and of the rule of court renata degener ksenija turković registrar president the relevant extract of the supreme court judgment read a follows by a declaration reported in the minute of the hearing of the may the representative of the defendant online newspaper belonging to the applicant indicated that the newspaper

64,the applicant wa born in and life in helsinki the applicant is a photographer and journalist for the weekly magazine suomen kuvalehti on september he wa sent by his employer to take photograph of the demonstration which wa being held in protest against the ongoing asia europe meeting asem in helsinki the demonstration wa an exceptionally large one in the finnish context and all medium followed it closely before the demonstration took place on august the helsinki police department wa alerted by the finnish security intelligence that the upcoming smash asem demonstration would be a hostile one and would not aim to highlight any clear political message the police department did not manage to establish contact with the organiser of the demonstration the demonstration wa to start at pm on september a separate area wa reserved for the representative of the medium so that they could freely and safely observe the situation and take photograph on the demonstration place at the start of the demonstration bottle stone and jar filled with paint were thrown at public and policeman some demonstrator kicked and hit police officer the police announced several time over loudspeaker that a peaceful demonstration wa allowed on the spot but that the crowd wa not allowed to demonstrate by marching the crowd tried to break through the police defence line relying on all the information in their possession the police decided to interrupt the demonstration which had now turned violent the police announced over loudspeaker that the demonstration wa stopped and that the crowd should leave the scene this announcement wa repeated several time hundred of people then left voluntarily after the escalation of violence the police considered that the event had turned into a riot and decided to seal off the demonstration area first only a few people were allowed to leave the area then the police established several exit route and people were allowed to leave when leaving they were asked to show id and their belonging were checked however the core group of around people remained in one of the demonstration spot including the applicant and a former member of parliament all of whom had been asked to leave the scene failing which they would be arrested according to the applicant he thought that this request only applied to the demonstrator he claim that sometime later he indicated to the police that he wa a representative of the medium he further claim that he wa wearing his press badge and that a police officer accepted this after having called his colleague the applicant decided to stay until the situation wa over a short time later the police arrested the demonstrator when leaving the scene the applicant wa also arrested the police arrested altogether person in the context

disobeying the police but did not impose any penalty on him the court found it established that the applicant had been aware of the order of the police to leave the scene but had decided to ignore them it appeared from the witness statement given before the court that the applicant had not told or indicated the arresting police officer that he wa a journalist according to the arresting officer this fact only became known to him when the relevant magazine appeared it appeared also from the witness statement that two other photographer who had been in the sealedoff area had been able to leave the scene without consequence just before the applicant wa arrested the court found it further established that the police order had been clear and that they had clearly concerned everybody the court balanced the article right against other interest finding that the police had had the right to ask the applicant among others including the former member of parliament to leave the scene the interference with the applicant right to exercise his freedom of expression had thus been based on law and it had fulfilled the legitimate aim of preventing disorder the interference had been necessary in a democratic society in order to put an end to a violent situation however relying on chapter section of the penal code no penalty wa imposed a the offence wa excusable the court found that the applicant who a a journalist wa confronted with contradictory expectation stemming from obligation imposed on the one hand by the police and on the other by his employer by letter dated january the applicant appealed to the helsinki court of appeal hovioikeus hovrätten claiming that the district court should have dismissed the charge against him he argued that his arrest and the fact that he wa found guilty were against the constitution and article of the convention the applicant wa a journalist and that he had not participated in the demonstration or caused any disorder the district court had not reasoned why his arrest and conviction were necessary in a democratic society and had thereby failed to justify the interference on april the court of appeal rejected the

democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument a admissibility the court note that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission the applicant contested the fact that the police were unaware of his status a a journalist at the time of the arrest his press badge had been hanging round his neck at the end of the demonstration the applicant also claimed that he had presented his press badge to the police when he had been taken to the bus to be taken into custody the applicant pointed out that it had been clear at the scene that he wa there to practise his profession a a photographer at the end of the demonstration there had remained about twenty demonstrator sitting in a circle and holding hand the applicant a former member of parliament and the police it had been clear to the police that neither the applicant nor the former mp had in any way participated in the demonstration the applicant had been doing his duty a a journalist it wa clear that there had been an interference with his right to freedom of expression the government had not given any reason why it had been necessary to remove the applicant from the scene nor had they given any reason why it had been necessary to arrest him and to find him guilty of disobeying the police order the government noted that the applicant had not been in any way prevented from taking photograph during the demonstration or when the area wa being sealed off by the police the applicant had not been arrested for acting a a photographer but for refusing to obey police order to leave the scene the applicant had been quickly released the next day when the police had found out that he wa a photographer for a magazine the domestic court had not imposed any sanction on the applicant nor had his camera or other equipment been confiscated he had been allowed to keep all the photograph he had taken and to use them unrestrictedly there wa thus no interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression in any event were the court of another opinion the government argued that the interference had been prescribed by law and that it had had a legal basis in the constitution the police act the assembly act and the penal code the interference had had the legitimate aim of protecting public safety health or moral and the right of others a well a of preventing disorder and crime a to the necessity in a democratic society the government pointed out that the smash asem demonstration had clearly been an event of considerable general importance this had also been recognised by the police and therefore a separate safe area had been reserved for the medium to observe the situation freely and safely the applicant and some other journalist had chosen not to take this option the domestic court had found that the police had had justifiable reason to seal the demonstration area and to order the demonstrator to disperse since they had not obeyed this order the police had been entitled to arrest and detain them when the demonstration had turned violent the police had allowed the medium to move outside the police line two other photographer who had been in the sealedoff area had left the scene and no measure had been imposed on them at any point also the applicant could have left the scene at any point without any consequence the government noted that the intention of the police had not been to prevent the applicant from exercising his profession but only to calm the situation and to restore public order everyone wa equal before the law and the fact that the applicant wa a journalist did not entitle him to disobey police order the other journalist had had no need to disobey police order but the applicant had done so knowingly the district court found it established that the police order had been clear and that they had clearly concerned everybody the fact that the applicant had also consulted a colleague by telephone and asked for advice on whether to stay or to leave clearly indicated that he had understood that the police order also concerned him the government pointed out that the policeman arresting the applicant had not noticed his press badge when he had been taken to the bus to take him to custody his id had been requested and he had also presented his press badge however the applicant had failed to mention his profession to the policeman receiving him in the custody room when the police had found out that he wa a journalist he had been allowed to call his employer the applicant had been detained from september at pm until september at pm that wa hour it had not been possible to interrogate him on the same day a the law prohibited interrogation between pm and am altogether person had been arrested and detained due to the demonstration the applicant had been one of the first to be released a he wa a journalist the government stressed that the applicant arrest and detention had thus been justifiable and could not be regarded a disproportionate moreover the domestic authority had applied the domestic provision in the light of article of the convention and had based their decision on acceptable assessment derived from the relevant circumstance considering the circumstance the interference with the applicant freedom of expression had been necessary in a democratic society the court assessment whether there wa an interference the court note that the government claimed that there had been no interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression whereas the applicant claimed that there clearly had been the court note that the applicant wa arrested by the police in the context of a demonstration and that he wa later found guilty by the domestic court of disobeying the police however no penalty wa imposed on him since the offence wa excusable the court considers that since the applicant arrest and conviction were the consequence of his conduct a newspaper photographer and journalist when disobeying the police the presumption is that there wa an interference with his freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the convention see juppala v finland no december whether it wa prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim the court note that freedom of expression is subject to the exception set out in article of the convention the court further note that the party agree that the impugned measure had a basis in finnish law in particular in section of the penal code it wa thus prescribed by law moreover the interference complained of had several legitimate aim namely the protection of public safety a well a the prevention of disorder and crime whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society according to the wellestablished caselaw of the court freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article of the convention it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society this freedom is subject to the exception set out in article which must however be strictly construed the need for any restriction must be established convincingly see for example lingens v austria july series a no and nilsen and johnsen v norway gc no echr viii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with a european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article see janowski v poland gc no echr i the court task in exercising it supervision is not to take the place of national authority but rather to review under article in the light of the case a a whole the decision they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation see among many other authority fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction the court must look at the impugned interference in the light of the case a a whole in particular it must determine whether the interference in issue wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it were relevant and sufficient see sunday time v the united kingdom no april series a no lingens v austria cited above barfod v denmark february series a no janowski v poland cited above and news verlags gmb h co kg v austria no echr i in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see jersild v denmark september series a no the court further emphasis the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society although the press must not overstep certain bound it duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with it obligation and responsibility information and idea on all matter of public interest see jersild v denmark cited above de haes and gijsels v belgium february report of judgment and decision i and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no echr iii not only do the medium have the task of imparting such information and idea the public also ha a right to receive them see sunday time v the united kingdom no cited above turning to the fact of the present case the court note that the applicant wa arrested charged and found guilty of having disobeyed the police his arrest took place in the context of a demonstration in which he had participated a a photographer and journalist a separate secure area had been reserved for the press but the applicant chose not to use it preferring to stay among the demonstrator the court note that it doe not appear that the applicant wa in any way prevented from taking photograph of the demonstration a the government pointed out his camera or other equipment wa not confiscated and he wa allowed to keep all the photograph he had taken and to use them unrestrictedly the court further note that when the demonstration turned violent the police sealed the demonstration area and ordered the demonstrator to disperse the domestic court found subsequently that the police had had justifiable reason to take these measure since these legal and legitimate order were not obeyed the police were entitled to arrest and detain the disobedient demonstrator the court also note that the police allowed the medium to move outside the police line two other photographer who were in the sealedoff area left the scene and no measure were imposed on them at any point the court observes that the applicant had waived his right to use the separated secured area for the press when he had decided to stay among the demonstrator also after the order to disperse the district court found it established that the applicant had been aware of the order of the police to leave the scene but had decided to ignore them the applicant could have left the scene and moved to the secured press area without any consequence at any time while the sealingoff lasted the applicant ha not even claimed that he could not have carried out his professional duty from the secured press area by not doing so the applicant knowingly took the risk of being arrested for contumacy the court note that it is not entirely clear at what stage the police learned that the applicant wa a journalist it appears from the witness statement given before the district court that the applicant did not tell or indicate the arresting police officer that he wa a journalist according to the government it wa only when he wa taken to the bus taking him to custody and when he wa asked to present his id that he also presented his press badge the applicant however failed to mention his profession to the policeman receiving him in the custody room when the police found out that he wa a journalist he wa allowed to call his employer the court note therefore that it appears that the applicant failed to make clear effort to identify himself a a journalist compare and contrast najafli v azerbaijan no october the court further considers that the applicant wa not a such prevented from exercising his freedom of expression and reporting the event moreover he wa offered the alternative to follow the demonstration from the secured area reserved to the press his arrest and conviction only related to disobeying the police a he failed to obey their order a the government pointed out the fact that the applicant wa a journalist did not give him a greater right to stay at the scene than the other people moreover the court note that the applicant wa held in detention for about hour a the government maintained the length of the detention is mainly explained by the fact that the applicant wa detained late at night and that the domestic law prohibited interrogation between pm and am in addition the court note that altogether person were arrested and detained due to the demonstration and that this fact may also have delayed the applicant release however the next day the applicant wa one of the first to be released due to his status a a journalist taking into account the consideration outlined above the court find that in any event any interference with the applicant exercise of his journalistic freedom wa only of limited extent given the opportunity made available to him to cover the event adequately the conduct sanctioned by the criminal conviction wa not his journalistic activity a such but his refusal to comply with a police order at the very end of the demonstration when the latter wa judged by the police to have become a riot in order to ass whether the necessity of the restriction of the exercise of the freedom of expression ha been established convincingly the court must examine the issue essentially from the standpoint of the relevance and sufficiency of the reason given by the domestic court for convicting the applicant the court must determine whether the applicant conviction struck a fair balance between the public and private interest involved and whether the standard applied were in conformity with the principle embodied in article see nikula v finland no echr ii the court considers that the demonstration wa a matter of legitimate public interest having regard in particular to it nature from the point of view of the general public right to receive information about matter of public interest and thus from the standpoint of the press there were justified ground for reporting the event to the public this wa also acknowledged by the authority and therefore a separate secure area had been reserved for the press the event attracted a lot of medium attention and wa closely followed the court note that the applicant wa the only journalist claiming that his freedom of expression had been violated in the context of the demonstration the court observes that the domestic court found it established that the applicant had understood that the police order to disperse also concerned him and that he had failed to obey these order the district court found by referring to article of the convention that the police order interfered with the applicant right to exercise his freedom of expression but that interference wa prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim a to the necessity the court found that it had been necessary to disperse the crowd because of the riot and the threat to the public safety and to order people to leave thus the restriction on the applicant freedom of expression were justified the court note that the district court analysed the matter from the article point of view in this analysis the court balanced the applicant freedom of expression against the state interest and found that there had been a pressing social need to take the impugned measure against the applicant a to the applicant conviction the court observes that it appears from the case file that the prosecution wa directed against altogether defendant who were accused of several type of offence the district court found it established that the applicant had committed a crime by disobeying the lawful order of the police however the court did not impose any penalty on the applicant a his act wa considered excusable he wa considered a a photographer and journalist to be confronted with contradictory expectation arising from obligation imposed on the one hand by the police and on the other hand by his employer moreover the court note that according to the domestic law no entry of the conviction wa made on the applicant criminal record a no penalty wa imposed see paragraph above in conclusion in the court opinion the reason relied on by the domestic court were relevant and sufficient for the purpose of article of the convention having regard to all the foregoing factor and taking into account the margin of appreciation afforded to the state in this area the court considers that the domestic court struck a fair balance between the competing interest at stake in sum the court concludes that the domestic court were entitled to decide that the interference complained of wa necessary in a democratic society accordingly there ha been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court declares unanimously the application admissible hold by five vote to two that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on february pursuant to rule and of the rule of court françoise elens passos ineta ziemele registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the separate opinion of judge nicolaou joined by judge de gaetano is annexed to this judgment izfepdissenting opinion of judge nicolaoujoined by judge de gaetanoat the time of the applicant arrest on the evening of september he wa on duty a a journalistphotographer working for a weekly magazine he had been assigned the task of covering a demonstration held in helsinki against the asia europe meeting asem it wa a political demonstration with economic undertone and by finnish standard an exceptionally large one the government themselves described it a an event of considerable public importance there wa unsurprisingly strong medium interest the authority expecting such interest made provision for a separate area from which journalist might follow event and take whatever photograph they could that area would presumably afford them some safety and comfort especially if it proved necessary for the police to take unpleasant suppressive measure the measure would not have been regarded a one meant to keep journalist at bay so that while they would have a fair view of general development they would not be able to spot or adequately distinguish incident occurring anywhere in the middle of the demonstration or at the far end instead one might reasonably have thought that the use of the area wa optional and that a journalist had freedom to move around and mingle with demonstrator in order to get a better understanding of event to obtain statement from participant and in the case of a photographer to take closeup which sometimes speak volume a it turned out journalist were denied this freedom according to prior intelligence there wa a risk of the demonstration turning violent and unfortunately it did the demonstration started at pm and after half an hour the police considered that it had become a riot they took measure to suppress it initially for about fortyfive minute no one wa allowed to leave save for a few individual then in furtherance of an order to disperse the police created exit route through which people could go on condition of showing an identity card and having their belonging checked shortly after pm only some twenty person remained at the scene the police called on them to leave and warned them that unless they did so they would be arrested the applicant wa among them still covering the event there is no indication that there wa at that stage a threat to public order the riot had already been quelled that is not to say of course that the police order ceased to have relevance a regard the demonstrator but the applicant wa not one of them and it ha never been suggested that he did anything inconsistent with his journalistic duty the applicant say that he did not expect that the order would apply to him a well at that stage he spoke about the matter with a colleague over the phone and asked for advice on whether he should leave or stay he decided to stay so a to cover the situation until it wa completely resolved he wa then arrested together with the others he claim that he wa wearing his press badge and had made his identity known according to the government he had not revealed his identity to the arresting officer but when taken to the police bus he showed both his id and his press badge however that made no difference at all section of chapter of the penal code a amended provides that the police may issue an order for the maintenance of public order or security or the performance of a duty and that to disobey would constitute contumacy towards the police a criminal offence punishable by a fine or by imprisonment for up to three month in the present case the order issued orally by the police could also have been orally revoked or varied according to what the circumstance might have required the object of the order wa to restore peace by dispersing the crowd in a controlled way it is surprising that it should have been thought that it could also apply to a journalist who wa lawfully present and covering the event in the context of his medium duty and that it could lead to his arrest the criminal court before which the applicant jointly with many others wa charged under the aforesaid provision simply found that he had been aware of police order that they had been clear and had covered everyone including him and that he had decided not to comply the domestic court having briefly considered article of the convention found that there had been an interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression that the interference had a lawful basis and pursued a legitimate aim namely preventing disorder and that the interference had been necessary for the purpose of putting an end to a violent situation still it may be noted that the situation had already been effectively dealt with by the time the applicant wa arrested the court found the applicant guilty a charged however it did not impose a sentence it regarded the offence a excusable because it considered that the applicant a a journalist must have faced a dilemma between his duty to his employer and the obligation imposed on him by the police order consequently by law the conviction wa not to be entered on the applicant criminal record thus the applicant wa first required to obey the police order and then when he failed to do so he had to be arrested and kept in detention for seventeen and a half hour it is to be noted that the domestic court never said that the arrest and detention were wrong or unnecessary subsequently the applicant had to be prosecuted and to stand trial and to be convicted of a criminal offence in the domestic court view all of that had been right and proper and well deserved but on the other hand the applicant would suffer no further consequence because the offence wa excusable the majority are content with that conclusion the applicant brought an appeal complaining inter alia that the trial court had not given reason why his arrest and conviction were necessary in a democratic society he wa obviously right in what he indicated but his appeal wa rejected without the court of appeal itself giving reason the supreme court refused leave for a further appeal it is not known why it seems to me that it wa only natural that the situation a it developed would heighten journalistic interest there wa nothing improper about that where a demonstration is peaceful the journalist function is essentially one of collecting and transmitting information and quite often adding comment but when tension build up and violence break out whereupon the authority resort to suppressive control measure the journalist assumes the role of public watchdog and his task then acquires even greater significance a to this role of the press see for example barthold v germany march series a no he is entitled to be in the very thick of thing until the very end and sometimes doe so at considerable risk to himself the reason is because in a democratic society the public have the right to know what happens during such difficult time this right form one of the basic safeguard of democracy hardly a day pass by when we are not made aware in one way or another of the need for journalistic freedom to perform that kind of role the domestic court view that the applicant wa inevitably faced with a dilemma a to where his loyalty lay and that this dilemma could only be resolved by giving precedence to the law quite miss the point it doe not in my respectful view reflect the true nature of the situation in which the applicant found himself he wa not one of the demonstrator he wa a journalistphotographer covering what the government themselves have described a an event of considerable public importance how could the police fail to realise the capacity in which the applicant wa present at the scene particularly at a stage when he wa with a very small remaining group a to whether he wa wearing his medium badge and whether he made his identity known to the police in good time i have already referred to the controversy on this point the domestic court made no finding on the matter but a i have noted it wa accepted that his identity wa established before he wa put on the police bus to the police station and further one might ask whether the applicant while locked up had not asserted his identity and remonstrated about spending the night in a cell there is a nagging question and it is this did the police really care whether the applicant wa a journalist or not the fact that he wa prosecuted tends to suggest that they did not it may also be added that if the police or the court were to have taken the view that the applicant prosecution should have been disconnected from his arrest and detention they would have been expected to look at these aspect separately and to give relevant explanation but they did not the majority take the view in line with the government position that the fact that the applicant wa a journalist did not give him a greater right to stay at the scene than the other people see paragraph of the judgment this aspect is seen a connected with the question of necessity the majority say paragraph that since these legal and legitimate order were not obeyed the police were entitled to arrest and detain the disobedient demonstrator but the applicant wa not a demonstrator and no one ha ever suggested that he wa the majority seem to be saying that since the applicant chose to stay among the demonstrator and not to use the area reserved for the press he should accept the same fate see paragraph and again referring to the question of necessity the majority say see paragraph that a to the necessity the court found that it had been necessary to disperse the crowd because of the riot and the threat to the public safety and to order people to leave thus the restriction on the applicant freedom of expression were justified i would respectfully observe that the majority conflate the meaning of the undoubted necessity to quell the riot with what the domestic court also saw a the necessity of compliance with a police order irrespective of it essence and it rationale an order which led to the imposition of restriction on a journalist freedom of expression through his arrest detention prosecution and conviction for a criminal offence simply because he had the courage to do his duty in furtherance of the public interest the majority speak of an analysis of article of the convention carried out by the domestic court my own understanding is that at least in the case of the applicant there wa no real analysis at all and that the domestic court judgment wa more by way of declaration than based on reasoning it ha not been substantiated why it wa necessary in a democratic society to equate a professional journalist operating within recognised professional limit in covering the demonstration with any of the people taking part in the demonstration and to impose drastic criminal restraint on him i consider that the order should not have been intended or interpreted a directed against the applicant a a journalist covering the event in question since his presence wa not connected with what needed to be countered and resolved i also consider that if the domestic court were unable to adopt such an interpretative approach they were bound in applying article of the convention to balance the competing interest involved yet they failed to do so it is incumbent on the national authority to convincingly establish by relevant and sufficient reason that curtailing press freedom is necessary in the sense that it meet a pressing social need see among many authority cumpănă and mazăre v romania gc no echr xi the court caselaw concerning the protection of journalistic source illustrates the court concern in this regard see goodwin v the united kingdom march report of judgment and decision ii and subsequent case such a tillack v belgium no november and voskuil v the netherlands no november which are particularly instructive in the latter case a journalist who wa called a a witness in criminal proceeding refused to name his source even when the judge ordered him to do so he wa punished by detention for noncompliance the court found a violation of article it held that the judicial order wa not justified by an overriding requirement in the public interest and so in balancing the competing interest the interest of a democratic society in securing a free press had to prevail there is no indication that any such balancing exercise wa carried out in the present case on the contrary the case reveals a onesided attitude on the part of the authority one likely to create a chilling effect on press freedom for the reason i have set out i regret that i am unable to follow the majority,,,
65,the applicant the applicant wa born on june and life in tryškiai he joined the lithuanian army during the s in and respectively the commander of the armed force awarded him the exemplary service and merit medal on august the commander of the armed force and the applicant who had the military rank of senior noncommissioned officer vyriausiasis puskarininkis concluded a fiveyear professional

the applicant had approached the newspaper with criticism of the new army disciplinary statute adopted by the lithuanian seimas almost unanimously a couple of month previously in the article the applicant argued that the new disciplinary statute restricted a serviceman defence right when he wa the subject of disciplinary proceeding in particular the statute wa vague on serviceman right to acquaint themselves with the substance of any internal investigation report against them the applicant also claimed that during disciplinary proceeding a serviceman had only a limited opportunity to have recourse to legal representation which in his view wa particularly harmful since few serviceman had the proper legal knowledge to defend themselves in person the article further stated that the applicant discontented with the new statute had conveyed his observation and suggestion to the president of the republic asking the latter to veto the statute according to presidential office source the president took account of the applicant proposal but decided to promulgate the statute anyway the chairman of the committee of national security of the seimas commented that the committee had

issued a decision to terminate the applicant professional military service contract and to transfer him to the army reserve the order wa based on article and of lm whereby a serviceman of the applicant statutory rank had to be transferred to the reserve when he reached fifty year of age on july the applicant appealed to the vilnius regional administrative court asking it to quash the decision of july and to reinstate him into professional military service the applicant also claimed that he had been discriminated against because he had defended another serviceman see paragraph above and because of his view a expressed in the publication in kauno diena in breach of article of the convention the applicant asserted that there were hundred of soldier in the lithuanian army who did not have speciality code allowing them to serve until year of age however they continued to serve in the army until the expiry of their military service contract even though they had already reached retirement age the applicant thus requested the court on the basis of article of the law on administrative proceeding see paragraph below to oblige army official to produce certain document regarding his dismissal and regarding the situation of four serviceman rl v jš and mi who to his knowledge had continued to serve in the military in the same grand duke vaidotas battalion despite the fact that they had reached retirement age he noted that those document were in the custody of the battalion commander and he could not obtain them on his own lastly the applicant acknowledged that in the minister of defence had changed the military specialist code and he had been transferred to other duty those of legal specialist all officer with lawyer duty were given the code of legal specialist but the applicant a noncommissioned officer had not been given a legal specialist code this meant that at that time he had no legal specialist code at all the administrative court found that under the applicable legislation the applicant wa obliged before he could bring a court action to exhaust other nonjudicial remedy namely to lodge an appeal with the minister of defence the applicant then appealed to the minister of defence against his discharge from the army on august the ministry of defence held that the decision to discharge the applicant from the army wa lawful and dismissed his appeal on october the vilnius regional administrative court dismissed a unfounded the applicant complaint regarding the annulment of his professional military service contract and his discharge from the army the court observed that under article and of lm a serviceman must be discharged from the army once his military service contract expired or arba he reached retirement age which in the applicant case wa fifty year the applicant had reached the age of fifty on june the court further noted that under article of lm soldier who had been holding military specialist post under the minister of defence decision of june could be discharged on reaching year of age however the applicant duty of a legal affair assistant vado padėjėjas teisės klausimais to the commander of the grand duke vaidotas battalion had not been included in the list approved by that decision accordingly he could not rely on the agerelated exception in addition in another case the supreme administrative court had already held that reaching retirement age wa the ground for discharge of a soldier from the military notwithstanding whether or not his military service contract had expired yet ruling of march in case no a the court further observed that article of lm gave the minister of defence discretion to extend in the interest of the military the professional military service of a soldier who had reached the age when he or she should be discharged however this wa a matter of discretion and placed no obligation on the minister the court did not address the applicant argument that four other serviceman of his unit had been allowed to continue military service despite having reached the age of discharge nor did it reply to the applicant request for the military service record of those four serviceman in the meantime the applicant also lodged a complaint with the ombudsman challenging his discharge from the army on november the ombudsman refused to examine the complaint on the ground that an identical complaint wa being examined by the administrative court and the law did not allow the ombudsman to deal with such complaint on november the applicant appealed to the supreme administrative court reiterating his argument of unlawful dismissal and discrimination his appeal statement indicates that he reiterated his request that his superior in the grand duke vaidotas battalion be ordered to produce certain document from the military service record of the four serviceman mentioned above who he stated had continued serving in the same unit a the applicant despite having reached retirement age the applicant asserted that discrimination would be easy to prove if the court would help him to obtain the military service record of those four serviceman a regard the military specialist code he noted that in august he had been granted specialist code on the basis of the military code system established by the minister of defence in thus allowing him to serve until the age of after the minister of defence amended the military code system in the applicant wa given military specialist code when in the minister of defence again changed the system of military specialist code and the applicant wa transferred to the post of legal specialist no specialist code wa assigned to him the applicant observed that officer who had legal post had been given the code of legal specialist but that he a a noncommissioned officer did not have such a code above all at present no specialist code at all had been granted to him šiuo metu iš viso man nėra suteiktas joks specialisto kodas lastly the applicant strongly asserted that the lower court had erred in interpreting and applying article and other provision of lm by a decision of may the supreme administrative court dismissed the appeal in setting out the reason it observed that pursuant to article of lm a serviceman had to be dismissed from military service once his contract had expired or he had reached the age of discharge unless the duration of his military service had been extended in the applicant case a a noncommissioned officer the age of discharge for him wa the court also emphasised that that legal norm wa imperative and applied to contract which were still valid and not to those which had already expired teisės norma skirta reglamentuoti teisinius santykius dėl galiojančios o ne pasibaigusios karo tarnybos sutarties nutraukimo this interpretation also followed from article of lm which provided that a contract could be annulled ahead of time in case provided for in article of that law moreover the possibility of the applicant military service contract being rescinded had also been mentioned in the contract itself see paragraph above taking into account the imperative nature of article it wa the army command duty and not a right to rescind a contract once the condition mentioned in that provision had been met furthermore article of lm provided only discretion for and not an obligation on the minister of defence to extend a serviceman military service the supreme administrative court also noted that according to his duty the applicant did not fall into the sphere regulated by article and of the law that is he did not have military specialist status moreover exceptional extension of term of service under article had not been applied to him consequently the fact of the case fully matched the circumstance listed in article and of the law the firstinstance court decision wa thus fully upheld the appellate court did not address the applicant request for the supplementary document to be obtained nor did the court deal with the allegation of discrimination against the applicant because of his service status in addition to the administrative proceeding concerning his discharge from military service the applicant also instituted another set of somewhat linked proceeding concerning his dismissal from vaidotas battalion which formally preceded the discharge from military service he reiterated the argument expressed in the earlier proceeding in relation to freedom of expression the applicant merely mentioned that he had been persecuted for his opinion because of the legal decision he had issued which wa favourable towards another serviceman see paragraph above it also appears from the summary of the applicant complaint in the record of the court decision of july see the next paragraph that this time the applicant had made no reference to the publication in kauno diena but insisted that he had been discriminated against because of his social status a a noncommissioned officer visàvis the commissioned officer on july the vilnius regional administrative court dismissed the applicant claim fully upholding the reasoning that in accordance with article and of lm the army wa under an obligation to discharge him from the military because of his age the court also noted that the qualification required for a legal post had been established by the minister of defence on june one of the obligatory requirement wa universitylevel higher education in law aukštasis universitetinis teisinis išsilavinimas accordingly the applicant wa not qualified to be appointed to a legal post because in he had graduated from šiauliai college of law and management from the programme of higherlevel nonuniversity law study aukštųjų neuniversitetinių teisės studijų programa a regard the alleged discrimination against noncommissioned officer visàvis commissioned officer the court observed that different requirement were applicable to soldier of different rank to reflect their experience and qualification a had been established in article of lm similarly by a ruling of october no the government had approved the regulation on military service tarnybos statutas point of which established that all lithuanian military officer are in command of soldier and noncommissioned officer visi karininkai yra kareivių ir puskarininkių ir liktinių viršininkai given that legal act established different social status for officer and noncommissioned officer the same requirement could not apply to both the court thus held that the applicant argument that he had a right to serve until year of age and wa not to be discharged from the army wa based only on his own idea and erroneous interpretation of the law lastly the court dismissed the applicant claim that he had been persecuted for his opinion having concluded that that claim wa based only on the applicant own supposition and guess the applicant appealed arguing that he had been persecuted because of his opinion on whether to grant childcare leave to another soldier it appears from the transcript of the hearing of his complaint in the appellate court decision that the applicant did not mention the publication in the kauno diena newspaper on may the supreme administrative court dismissed the appeal noting that the applicant claim had already been decided in another administrative case by a decision of may see paragraph and above the court confirmed that article of lm provided for two alternative when a soldier had to be discharged from the army when his contract expired or emphasised by the appellate court when he reached the age stipulated in article of that law accordingly once a serviceman reached the retirement age the army had an obligation and not a right to discharge him the court also noted that it wa free to ass evidence to establish the circumstance of the case however the applicant had not provided any evidence confirming that he had been persecuted for the opinion he had given on the grant of childcare leave to another soldier the applicant ha been receiving a military pension since july b the four serviceman who served in the same grand duke vaidotas battalion a the applicant it appears from the party explanation and the document presented that the situation of the four serviceman whom the applicant had mentioned in his complaint of discrimination to the administrative court see paragraph and above wa a follows the fiveyear professional military service contract with yearold junior sergeant jaunesnysis seržantas mi wa signed by extending a previous contract on january his military rank and the requirement of article of lm stipulate that the serviceman wa to be discharged at the age of however from mi held a

service contract to be terminated and for him to be discharged from professional military service the court also indicated that dismissal of a serviceman because of his age wa linked simply to age and not to the rescission of the military service contract kario atleidimas iš pareigų dėl nustatyto amžiaus siejamas su pačiu nustatyto amžiaus suėjimo faktu o ne su sutarties nutraukimo faktu on march in case no a the supreme administrative court confirmed it position that article of lm wa the ground for discharge of a soldier from military service because of age reached notwithstanding whether or not his military service contract had expired yet the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the administrative court proceeding concerning his dismissal from the army were unfair he relied on article of the convention which read a follows in the determination of his civil right and obligation everyone is entitled to a fair hearing by a tribunal a the party submission the applicant the applicant argued that the vilnius regional administrative court and the supreme administrative court in their decision of october and may see paragraph and had been partial and unfair in that they had ignored his procedural right given that the essence of his case concerned allegedly unlawful dismissal from military service on a discriminatory basis to fully present his case the applicant had asked both court to order his battalion commanding officer to provide evidence which he wa not able to obtain on his own concerning four soldier who had served in the same military unit if reaching a particular age wa an absolute ground for dismissal from military service those four serviceman should already have been dismissed on the same basis that is their age moreover this should have happened much earlier than when the applicant wa dismissed however the court simply ignored the request without even giving reason for refusal the applicant thus considered that there wa a breach of his right to adduce evidence which wa essential to a fair hearing of his claim of discrimination for his view and idea the government the government firstly submitted that article of the convention wa not applicable to the proceeding regarding the applicant discharge from professional military service those proceeding concerned neither the traditional category of civil servant nor did they concern an ordinary labour dispute relating to salary allowance or similar entitlement the government thus took the view that the nature of the responsibility of those serving in the armed force of the state involved a special bond of trust and loyalty and exercise of public power the state therefore enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation regarding discharge from the military and extension of military service contract it followed that dispute between the state and it military personnel concerning the application of the provision of the domestic law on discharge from professional military service should not be regarded a civil within the meaning of article and thus should fall outside the court competence ratione materiae a an alternative argument for incompatibility of the case under the above provision the government noted that article of lm excluded dispute relating to extension of professional military service contract from the domestic court jurisdiction the instant case wa on the one hand related to allegedly unlawful discharge however on the other hand it could also be regarded a related to the issue of extension of a contract provided the court found that article of the convention applied to the administrative court proceeding at issue the government were fully confident that those proceeding had been fair they noted that it wa for the domestic court to ass the evidence before them a well a the relevance of given item of evidence and that article of the convention doe not lay down any rule on the admissibility of evidence a such they referred to barberà messegué and jabardo v spain december series a no and galstyan v armenia no november that being so even though the lithuanian court had the authority to compel item of evidence to be produced in court under article of the law on administrative proceeding those court were primarily entitled to decide on the relevance of certain evidence in the context of the applicant case similarly under article of that law no evidence had any value set in advance the government considered that having objectively and scrupulously examined the applicant case in the light of the relevant legal provision the domestic court had found that the prerequisite condition necessary to discharge a serviceman because of age established in article and of lm had been met once the administrative court had established the lawfulness of the legal ground for the applicant discharge other circumstance including those related to the military service of four other military officer relied on by the applicant were no longer relevant to the examination of his case lastly the government maintained that the serviceman and servicewomen the applicant had described in his request a not discharged despite their age actually served within the system of national defence in compliance with the provision of domestic law including the provision establishing the allowed age see paragraph above b the court assessment admissibility the court first turn to the government objection to the effect that article of the convention is not applicable to the applicant complaint about his dismissal from professional military service it reiterates however that in order for the respondent state to be able to rely before the court on the applicant status a a civil servant or in this case a a professional soldier to exclude the protection embodied in article two condition must be fulfilled it will be for the respondent government to demonstrate firstly that a civil servant applicant doe not have a right of access to a court under national law and secondly that the exclusion of the right under article for the civil servant is justified see vilho eskelinen and others v finland gc no echr ii also see igor vasilchenko v russia no february in the present case it is common ground that the applicant served in the army on the basis of a professional military service contract concluded between him and the ministry of defence on august it is true that the first paragraph of article of lm excludes dispute regarding acceptance for military service or extension of military service contract nevertheless the court observes that the applicant dispute concerned his dismissal from professional military service nor wa the matter of his dispute the extension of his contract in fact he had claimed the right civil in it nature to continue professional military service until the expiry of the contract he already had the dispute wa genuine and serious and the result of the proceeding wa directly decisive for the right in question it is also plain from the fact that a regard his dismissal from the military the applicant had access to administrative court under national law in accordance with the second paragraph article of lm accordingly article is applicable the court further considers that this part of the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention no other ground for declaring it inadmissible ha been established therefore it should be declared admissible merit the applicant wa dissatisfied that when examining his complaint of dismissal from the military service on discriminatory ground the administrative court had based their decision merely on an interpretation of article of lm and had ignored his repeated request for access to the military file of four specific serviceman on this point the court observes that one of the element of a fair hearing within the meaning of article is the right to adversarial proceeding each party must in principle have the opportunity to make known any evidence needed for his claim to succeed see mantovanelli v france march report of judgment and decision ii moreover the requirement of equality of arm implies that each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case including his evidence under condition that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage visàvis his opponent see for instance dombo beheer bv v the netherlands october series a no helle v finland december report of judgment and decision viii the court ha also held that the effect of article is inter alia to place the tribunal under a duty to conduct a proper examination of the submission argument and evidence adduced by the party without prejudice to it assessment of whether they are relevant to it decision see kraska v switzerland april series a no b and van de hurk v the netherlands april series a no that being so the court nonetheless reiterates that it is not within it province to substitute it own assessment of the fact and the evidence for that of the domestic court and a a general rule it is for these court to ass the evidence before them see among many other authority edward v the united kingdom december series a no b furthermore while article guarantee the right to a fair hearing it doe not lay down any rule on the admissibility of evidence a such which is primarily a matter for regulation under national law nevertheless the question which must be answered is whether the proceeding a a whole including the way in which the evidence wa obtained were fair see galstyan cited above turning to the circumstance of the instant case the court recall that in his written complaint to the vilnius regional administrative court the applicant argued that he had been discriminated against because of his opinion he submitted that at least four other serviceman in his military unit had been allowed to continue serving after reaching the age of discharge but before the expiry of their contract for the applicant given that an allegation of discrimination wa at the heart of his complaint a comparison between his situation and that of those four other serviceman wa indispensable for him to be able to present his grievance see paragraph above the applicant reiterated that request on appeal arguing that the lower court refusal to order his military commander to provide evidence related to the service history of those four serviceman had deprived him of the opportunity to show that he wa the only soldier to whom the law had been applied so rigorously see paragraph above the court further observes that despite those argument by the applicant the administrative court limited their examination to the letter of lm having examined whether his discharge from the army had been justified under article thereof namely because of his age the government have acknowledged that once those court had established a lawful the applicant discharge from professional military service on that ground other circumstance including those related to the alleged discrimination and those other four serviceman were not relevant to the examination of the applicant case the court can not subscribe to this view whilst being careful not to substitute it own assessment of the fact and evidence for that of the domestic court the court nevertheless considers that the discrimination aspect of the applicant complaint should have been addressed by the administrative court although those court were not bound in law to order the applicant commanding officer to produce the evidence he requested and which the applicant wa unable to obtain himself and notwithstanding whether the military service history of those four serviceman would have proved the applicant point that evidence wa likely to have a preponderant influence on the assessment of the applicant complaint by those court see mantovanelli cited above the court strike a note of caution in observing that article of the convention obliges court to give reason for their decision but can not be understood a requiring a detailed answer to every argument see van de hurk cited above however given that the applicant had given full detail of which specific evidence he wished to obtain and why it wa directly relevant to his complaint and to his wish to influence the court decision and considering that at that stage of the proceeding it wa not yet clear whether that evidence wa necessary in order to determine the applicant discrimination claim the court find that the administrative court failure to assist the applicant in obtaining evidence and to give it consideration or at least to provide reason why this wa not necessary denied the applicant essential mean to argue his case in dispute concerning civil right such a the present one such a limited review can not be considered to be an effective judicial review under article see mutatis mutandis kmc v hungary no july and the caselaw cited therein in the light of the above the court hold that the proceeding before the administrative court see paragraph above taken a a whole did not satisfy the requirement of a fair and public hearing within the meaning of article there ha accordingly been a breach of that provision ii alleged violation of article of the convention taken alone or in conjunction with article relying on article and of the convention the applicant complained that he wa dismissed from the military for his opinion and in a discriminatory manner the relevant part of article read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary article of the convention read a follows the enjoyment of the right and freedom set forth in the convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such a sex race colour language religion political or other opinion national or social origin association with a national minority property birth or other status a the party submission the applicant the applicant complained of a violation of his right to freedom of speech he maintained that a a serviceman he had been responsible for many year for giving legal advice to the commander of the armed force on the question of statutory penalty his opinion on the statutory penalty the army imposed on soldier often did not correspond to that of others at the ministry of defence the applicant stated that he had made many proposal with the aim of improving inter alia serviceman procedural right when the new army disciplinary statute wa being drafted a his superior and the state president had failed to take his proposal into account the applicant had contacted the kauno diena daily and expressed his idea to the press the internal inquiry into his communication with the daily had been started the same day even though that inquiry had later been discontinued by the authority acknowledgement that the applicant had not violated military discipline the appeal to kauno diena and to the state president had had direct consequence for the applicant he wa dismissed from professional military service before the expiry of his contract most importantly in order to avoid accusation of interference with freedom of expression the authority at the ministry of defence chose to dismiss him not on the ground that he had appealed to the medium but formally on the basis of article of lm thus leaving no official trace of injustice if that provision had been applied to others in the same manner several hundred soldier would have been dismissed from service however none of them except the applicant had suffered the same consequence the example of four soldier rl v jš and mi he relied on during the administrative court proceeding confirmed that there were more soldier who should have been dismissed from the army but that this wa not done lastly he also challenged a misleading the two example provided by the government see paragraph and above the applicant then asserted that the interference with his right to express his opinion had no basis in lithuanian law nor wa it justified by any of the ground listed in article of the convention because his publicly expressed criticism over the staff reform had not disclosed any classified information or posed a threat to the state security the applicant dismissal from professional military service wa nothing other than revenge for his public appeal in the medium the government the government maintained at the outset that there had been no interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression because he had not experienced any negative effect in relation to the publication in kauno diena they noted that the majority of case examined by the court under article of the convention had involved either final criminal conviction or civil decision against a person in the instant case however the internal inquiry into the applicant action regarding the publication although opened on the very same day a that of the publication march wa discontinued on march on the ground that the act committed by him did not constitute a disciplinary violation of the statute of military discipline because he had acted within the bound of his right to impart information in accordance with article of lm a mere internal inquiry into the applicant action which in itself did not create any consequence for the applicant therefore could not be considered a constituting an interference with the right to freedom of expression even if the court assumed that the mere opening of an internal inquiry could be seen a interference the government considered that it wa authorised by inter alia article of lm which establishes certain restriction associated with military service including public expression of disagreement with policy being implemented by the government of a democratically elected state the opening of the internal inquiry into the applicant act pursued a legitimate aim in the interest of national security and for the prevention of disorder lastly the inquiry wa necessary and proportionate given that the applicant criticism of the new statute of military discipline had been expressed publicly and not internally see e v germany dec no november and grigoriades v greece november report of judgment and decision vii the government also considered that even if the court did see the applicant discharge from the military a an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of expression that presumption would be incorrect the government categorically rejected any such consideration because the applicant had been discharged in accordance with the domestic law for having reached retirement age and not because of the criticism he had expressed in the article in kauno diena the government also pointed out that in the domestic proceeding concerning his discharge the applicant had raised his allegation of discrimination only very briefly while in essence disputing the interpretation and application of article of lm however having regard to the interpretation of that provision by the administrative court in the applicant case a well a in other relevant caselaw the applicant wa discharged from the military in accordance with the domestic law and there wa no ground to allege any possible discrimination in any regard the government further questioned the applicant argument that four other serviceman rl v jš and mi had had to be discharged from the military because of their age but had nevertheless continued to serve on this point the government referred to the domestic law and fact relating to the service history of those four officer see paragraph above in this connection the government also saw it a relevant to provide the court with two example which in their view were analogous to the applicant case where the serviceman were discharged from professional military service on the ground of their age despite the fact that they still had valid military service contract see paragraph and above finally the administrative court had been consistent in interpreting article of lm a having the effect that once a serviceman reached the age of retirement this wa an imperative ground to terminate his military service see paragraph and above above all that interpretation also remained consistent in the applicant case b the court assessment admissibility the court considers that the applicant complaint are not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention no other ground for declaring them inadmissible ha been established they should therefore be declared admissible merit the court ha held on numerous occasion that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of that pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society freedom of expression a enshrined in article is subject to a number of exception which however must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restriction must be convincingly established see vogt v germany september series a no with further reference article doe not stop at the gate of army barrack it applies to military personnel a it doe to all other person within the jurisdiction of the contracting state nevertheless a the court ha previously indicated it must be open to the state to impose restriction on freedom of expression where there is a real threat to military discipline a the proper functioning of an army is hardly imaginable without legal rule designed to prevent serviceman from undermining it it is not however open to the national authority to rely on such rule for the purpose of frustrating the expression of opinion even if these are directed against the army a an institution see grigoriades cited above see also vereinigung demokratischer soldaten österreichs and gubi v austria december series a no the government argued that there had been no violation of the applicant right to freedom of expression because he had not experienced any negative effect from the publication in the kauno diena newspaper on this point the court indeed note that the internal inquiry into the applicant action regarding that publication and his address to the state president were terminated on the ground that the applicant had acted within the boundary of article of lm and no disciplinary sanction wa imposed on him see paragraph above the court therefore considers that a far a it concern that inquiry in itself in view of it outcome the applicant can not claim to be a victim of a violation of the convention however it will nevertheless take that investigation into account when examining the main issue in the present case namely whether the applicant military service wa terminated solely a a result of the legal necessity to discharge him because of his age a the government claimed or whether a the applicant argued he wa dismissed because of his opinion the court find that although the sequence of event the applicant critical remark in kauno diena the internal investigation into his action a disciplinary penalty for failing to give proper legal advice see paragraph above and eventually the decision to start the procedure to discharge him because of his age assessed in it entirety might appear to corroborate the applicant version of event this doe not allow the court to conclude with certainty that the applicant wa punished for his opinion and that termination of his military service wa not simply the result of a proper application of article of lm see by converse implication ivanova v bulgaria no april in previous case the court ha indeed found that disciplinary sanction for public remark see e v germany cited above or even prosecution and conviction of the soldier see grigoriades cited above had been a clear indication of an interference with the right to impart idea at variance with article of the convention however in the instant case such tangible indication are absent unlike the fact in ivanova no new requirement for the applicant post which he did not meet had been introduced after the publication in kauno diena none of the applicant superior in the army had made public statement to the effect that he should be discharged from the military because of his opinion see in contrast and mutatis mutandis kosiek v germany august series a no it is also noteworthy that the obligation to terminate contract when the retirement age is reached had been confirmed by the supreme administrative court in it earlier ruling of and see paragraph and above which preceded the applicant case by some three year and thus illustrate the established practice of the domestic court the applicant also sought support for his claim of discrimination from the military service record of four soldier of his unit rl v jš and mi he considered that those four soldier had been in a similar situation to that of himself but had been treated differently on this point the court reiterates that article of the convention affords protection against different treatment without an objective and reasonable justification of person in similar situation see hoffmann v austria june series a no c and vojnity v hungary no february however having given due consideration to the fact paragraph above it is the court opinion that such an assertion is not substantiated the professional military service history of those four serviceman show that each of them wa entitled to serve until the expiry of their contract despite the fact that they had reached retirement age because unlike the applicant they had military specialist code conversely a the applicant himself acknowledged during the court proceeding at the time of his discharge from the army he had no such status see paragraph and above in view of the above the court find that the applicant discharge from professional military service once he had reached retirement age did not amount to interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of expression see harabin v slovakia no november there ha therefore been no violation of article of the convention taken alone or in conjunction with article thereof iii other alleged violation of the convention citing article and article of protocol no to the convention the applicant lastly brought forward a series of grievance which may be summarised a a complaint that his discharge from the army breached the principle of liberty and security caused him pecuniary damage and wa not examined by the ombudsman the court ha examined the remainder of the applicant complaint a submitted by him however having regard to all the material in it possession it find that these complaint do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the right and freedom set out in the convention or it protocol it follows that this part of the application must be rejected a manifestly illfounded pursuant to article and of the convention iv application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court find that there ha been a violation of the convention or the protocol thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party a damage the applicant claimed that after his dismissal from the military service before the expiry of his contract he suffered pecuniary damage because he received a lower pension he asked that the government be ordered to review the sum paid for his pension and compensate the unpaid part or alternatively to award him euro eur the applicant further claimed that he had received no salary food allowance or housing allowance which all together were equal to lithuanian lit ltl approximately eur lastly the applicant claimed eur for nonpecuniary damage he had suffered because of the internal inquiry into his contact with the medium and the court unwillingness to defend his human right the government considered that the pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage claimed by the applicant were absolutely unsubstantiated and excessive the court doe not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged it therefore reject this claim on the other hand it award the applicant eur in compensation for nonpecuniary damage b cost and expense the applicant made no claim for cost and expense the court therefore make no award under this head c default interest the court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the european central bank to which should be added three percentage point for these reason the court unanimously declares the applicant complaint under article and admissible and the rest of the application inadmissible hold that there ha been a violation of article of the convention hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention taken alone or in conjunction with thereof holdsa that the respondent state is to pay the applicant within three month from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with article of the convention eur six thousand euro plus any tax that may be chargeable in respect of nonpecuniary damage to be converted into lithuanian lit at the rate applicable at the date of settlementb that from the expiry of the abovementioned three month until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate

considering the present and future living condition of the pregnant woman the termination of the pregnancy is medically necessary to avert a danger to the life or the danger of grave injury to the

bverf ge accepted abortion being performed by doctor after a pregnant woman had obtained counselling by a third person and developed a rather singular approach by qualifying certain act of abortion a unlawful but not punishable abortion which are performed without the establishment of a medical indication must not be treated a being justified not unlawful schwangerschaftsabbrüche die ohne feststellung einer indikation nach der beratungsregelung vorgenommen werden dürfen nicht für gerechtfertigt nicht rechtswidrig erklärt werden however abortion performed by a doctor within twelve week

civil code grant any person whose personality right concretely risk being violated by another person a claim to compel that other person to refrain from performing the impugned action the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that the court of appeal order to desist from labelling abortion aggravated murder on his webpage had violated his freedom of expression a provided in article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation or right of others a admissibility the court note that this complaint is neither inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remedy see annen v germany no november nor manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission the applicant argued that the court of appeal desist order had interfered with his freedom of expression without being justified by the protection of the personality right of dr q he submitted that his website had contributed to a public debate and he had not personally attacked dr q who had been only one of the doctor listed on the website an overall assessment of the website showed that his intention had not been to slander a particular doctor but to criticise the legal situation in germany under which abortion performed by a doctor within twelve week of conception and following obligatory counselling were considered to be unlawful but were exempt from criminal liability in the light of his contribution to a public debate of great importance possible interference with doctor personality right had been justified the government submitted that the injunction by the court of appeal had not violated the applicant freedom of expression the court had carefully weighed the applicant freedom of expression against the right of the doctor concerned arising from article of the convention in doing so it had recognised the importance of the applicant freedom of expression especially within the context of the public debate about abortion within the scope of it margin of appreciation the court of appeal had come to the compelling conclusion that the content of the applicant website had been such a serious violation of dr q personality right a to justify a restriction on the applicant freedom of expression the government further argued that unlike in the case of annen cited above the karlsruhe court of appeal had carried out an extensive analysis of the content of the website and had documented part of it with screen shot in doing so it had sufficiently examined the applicant statement in the light of the right to freedom of expression and had also addressed alternative possibility of interpretation a a result the court had concluded that in characterising the medical activity of dr q a aggravated murder and equating them with the holocaust the applicant had committed a serious personal attack and had therefore violated dr q personality right the court assessment at the outset the court considers and this is not in dispute between the party that the injunction interfered with the applicant freedom of expression had a legal basis and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the right and reputation of dr q it therefore remains to be determined whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society and whether the balancing exercise undertaken by the domestic court wa in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the fundamental principle concerning the question of whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the court caselaw and have recently been summarised a follows see delfi a v estonia gc no june with further referencesi freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society a set forth in article this freedom is subject to exception which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article iii the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact the court further reiterates that the right to protection of reputation is protected by article of the convention a part of the right to respect for private life see chauvy and others v france no echr vi pfeifer v austria no november and polanco torres and movilla polanco v spain no september in order for article to come into play however an attack on a person reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be made in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life see a v norway no april axel springer ag v germany gc no february and delfi a cited above in case that concerned allegation of criminal conduct the court also took into account that under article of the convention individual have a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty see among other authority worm v austria august report of judgment and decision v and du roy and malaurie v france no echr x when examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interest of the protection of the reputation or right of others the court may be required to ascertain whether the domestic authority have struck a fair balance when protecting two value guaranteed by the convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain case namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by article and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in article see hachette filipacchi associés v france no june mgn limited v the united kingdom no january axel springer ag cited above and delfi a cited above although opinion may differ on the outcome of a judgment where a balancing exercise wa undertaken by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the court would require strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see lillo stenberg and sæther v norway no january with reference to axel springer ag cited above and von hannover v germany no gc no and echr turning to the circumstance of the present case the court note at the outset that the court of appeal in contrast to the court in the case of annen v germany no november assessed the website with reference to the situation at the relevant time the court therefore concludes that the legal protection received by the applicant at the domestic level wa compatible with the procedural requirement of article of the convention a regard the balancing of the applicant freedom of expression and the doctor personality right the court acknowledges like the court of appeal that the applicant statement addressed question of public interest it further observes that the court of appeal held that the applicant had stated on his website that the medical activity performed by dr q had constituted aggravated murder and examined in detail how the term aggravated murder had to be understood it concluded that the content of the website had been ambiguous and that the statement could be understood a a personalised accusation against dr q of having perpetrated the criminal offence of aggravated murder it therefore concluded that the applicant statement could be understood a statement of fact since the statement were evidently incorrect the court of appeal ordered the injunction the court reiterates that the classification of a statement a a fact or a a value judgment is a matter which in the first place fall within the margin of appreciation of the national authority in particular the domestic court see prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no having regard to the screenshots of the website provided by the government the applicant statement and the presentation of these statement the court find the classification by the court of appeal acceptable the court also agrees with the court of appeal conclusion that the applicant statement could be understood a an accusation that dr q had perpetrated the criminal offence of aggravated murder the court of appeal reasoned that the applicant had not made it sufficiently clear that doctor providing abortion in accordance with article a of the criminal code had been exempted from criminal liability therefore the present case ha to be distinguished from the case of annen cited above which concerned a leaflet of the applicant in which he had called abortion unlawful but had clearly provided an additional explanation that they had not been subject to criminal liability in the present case however the applicant did not provide such additional information but merely stated that abortion constituted aggravated murder and mentioned only once that they were unpunished see paragraph above this singular reference in the context of counseling centre could easily go unnoticed and did not have to be understood a elaboration of the legal situation in germany according to which doctor providing abortion in accordance with article a of the criminal code were exempted from criminal liability concerning the factual foundation for the applicant statement the court note that the applicant argued neither before the domestic court nor before the court that the abortion performed by dr q constituted aggravated murder in the legal sense of article of the criminal code the court therefore concludes that there wa no factual foundation whatsoever for the allegation that dr q committed the criminal offence of aggravated murder the court would further add that even where a statement amount to a value judgment there must be a sufficient factual basis to support it failing which it will be excessive see jerusalem v austria no echr ii consequently the court find that even assuming that the applicant statement were to be considered value judgment there wa not a sufficient factual basis for calling abortion a performed by dr q aggravated murder in that context the court also note that the accusation were not only very serious something reflected in the fact that a conviction for aggravated murder would carry a life sentence but might also incite to hatred and aggression lastly the court observes that the applicant wa not criminally convicted for slander or ordered to pay damage contrast pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi but that the applicant wa only ordered to desist from labelling abortion such a those performed by dr q aggravated murder and to desist therefore from implying that dr q wa committing that criminal offence having regard to the foregoing and in particular to the seriousness of the accusation against dr q the court considers that the injunction wa not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and that the reason given by the court of appeal were relevant and sufficient the interference with the applicant exercise of his right to freedom of expression could therefore reasonably be regarded by the domestic court a necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation and right of others there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously declares the complaint concerning article admissible hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rule of court claudia westerdiek yonko grozev registrar president,,,

under article of the convention in particular they argued that the domestic authority had not had the information sought by the applicant according to the government russian law required information centre to prepare crime statistic report by processing statistical data card data card differed in type and covered a wide range of information related to a specific crime committed the data processing carried out by the information centre wa predominantly manual and not all information from the data card wa processed only selected type of crime and parameter were included in crime statistic report with respect to the first part of the applicant request for information the government submitted that the authority only calculated the total number of person found administratively liable for prostitution and transferred that information to the information centre the specific parameter requested by the applicant the offender sex residence nationality and the year of the offence were not taken into account with respect to the second and third part of the applicant request the government observed that the statistical report produced by the information centre did not include data on the number of criminal case instituted and individual found guilty under article and case related to sexual exploitation of the criminal code there wa no breakdown by the offender sex age level of education residence nationality or the year of the offence in addition the government noted with respect to article of the criminal code that crime based on criminal intent to carry out

by the information centre were published on the official website of the ministry of interior and federal state statistic service without any omission turning to the final part of the applicant request

that statistical data card produced by the relevant authority for example investigator and collected by the information centre contained all the parameter asked for by him he alleged that the

have provided him with all the relevant data they had the third party commentsa helsinki foundation for human right hfhr the hfhr submitted that the right of access to public information wa an element of international and national legal system of human right protection with reference to the court position in sdružení jihočeské matky v the czech republic no july and társaság a szabadságjogokért v hungary no april the hfhr advocated for a broader interpretation of the notion of the freedom to receive information the hfhr took the view that the right of access to public document fell within the scope of guarantee set forth in article of the convention and that any decision to restrict access to document related to a matter of public interest should be subject to a strict scrutiny in accordance with the requirement of article b open society justice initiative osji the osji stressed that the right to receive information wa wellrecognised in various national and international legal system the disclosure of information including statistical data about the operation of the criminal justice system contributed not only to democratic accountability in the field of law enforcement but also to general respect for the rule of law the osji noted that the court had long recognised a conditional right of access to stateheld information in circumstance where failure to provide such information adversely affected the enjoyment of the right to respect for private and family life the osji reiterated that a state could not restrict a person from receiving information that others wished or might be willing to impart it noted that the court had recognised a right to receive information held by public authority relevant to public debate irrespective of any personal interest other than an interest to contribute to public debate in addition the osji submitted with particular respect to statistical information that both raw data and the capability needed to generate crime statistic tended to be by their nature in the exclusive possession of government agency granting them a real monopoly over information in that field such monopoly tended to improperly interfere with the free flow of information and idea b the court assessment admissibility the court note that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further

assessment of whether a refusal to provide the information can be regarded a an interference with the freedom to receive and impart information a protected by article of the convention see magyar helsinki bizottság cited above accordingly the court ha to establish whether in the present case the relevant domestic authority were in possession of the information asked for by the applicant it follows from the fact of the case see paragraph above and submission of the party that although the statistical data card contained the parameter required by the applicant only selected parameter were taken into account by the information centre and included in the publicly available crime statistic report those report a confirmed by the party did not meet the requirement proposed by the applicant the court note that the applicant did not seek access to the statistical data card or even final statistical report which were ready and available instead he essentially asked the domestic authority to process and summarise information using specific parameter the court therefore accepts the government argument and concludes that the relevant authority did not have information a specific a sought by the applicant the information he wa seeking wa therefore not only not ready and available but did not exist in the form the applicant wa looking for the court further recall that article of the convention doe not impose an obligation to collect information upon the applicant request particularly when a in the present case a considerable amount of work is involved see weber v germany dec no

68,the applicant błaja news sp z oo is a limited liability company registered in łódź it wa represented before the court by mr r kotliński it director the applicant company publishes a weekly magazine entitled fakty i mity in the magazine published an article signed anna tarczynska written by the journalist msz it concerned allegation of unlawful dealing between the lódź public prosecutor office and various criminal involved in drug trafficking it opening paragraph read a follows an elite group of prosecutor trusted by minister z the then minister of justice are suppressing the truth about a colleague of theirs involved in drug trafficking we presume that the minister is not a drug addict even though he sometimes doe look bizarre we also presume that the prosecutor said to be his most trusted collaborator are not junky why then do they tolerate among themselves a wellknown prosecutor in łódź who is involved in drug trafficking thats how the state creates an army of janissary the woman in question will now do whatever they want knowing what they can accuse her of on the other hand they might be afraid that she will go public with some charge because it is obvious that she did not consume almost one kilogram of amphetamine herself some time ago gossip wa going around the town that the prosecutor amuse themselves at their party by taking amphetamine an officer of the central investigation office centralne biuro śledcze explains to u but the woman is the most important person in the story prosecutor anna currently work in the investigation division of the łódź regional prosecutor office a recently a april she wa hailed in the medium and at reception a a spokesperson of the appellate prosecutor office shortly after prosecutor b became the chief of the latter she disappeared from public view and someone else replaced her the real reason for her disappearance from the public scene wa fully understandable for a narrow circle of insider namely prosecutor who knew the detail of investigation concerning a wellknown case involving the disappearance of drug stored a physical evidence by the prosecution the article went on to describe a drugtrafficking transaction on an unspecified date in a street in łódź referring to statement by two anonymous witness charged with drug trafficking referred to a witness no and witness no they stated that they had handed over the drug to mk who at the material time had been married to prosecutor anna the beauty of it wa that at the transaction scene mk had his own security mk came to the scene in a blue renault clio driven by a woman it turn out that it wa prosecutor anna who being present in the car throughout the transaction provided a guarantee of security for her former husband in the meantime mk disappeared even though we do not believe that he had been kindly forewarned that he would be arrested the fact remains that prosecutor m stayed the proceeding against his colleague husband prosecutor anna is unreachable even though the secretariat in the investigation division told u repeatedly that she wa in her office she never picked up the phone subsequently the prosecutor described in the article a prosecutor anna brought a civil claim against the applicant company and against rk it president and editorinchief of the magazine she claimed protection of personal right within the meaning of article and of the civil code by a judgment of september the łódź regional court allowed the claim and ordered the applicant company jointly with the magazine editorinchief to publish an apology in the magazine it wa to be published once and wa to read a follows the editor of fakty i mity apologise to m atk prosecutor at the łodź regional prosecutor office for breaching her personal right through publishing in it issue no in october untrue information namely that she had link with criminal circle involved in drug trafficking for slandering her with allegation of aiding and abetting drug dealing and for suggesting that criminal proceeding had been instituted against her they were also ordered to pay polish zloty pln to the claimant a compensation for the breach of her personal right the court established that the claimant had married mk in the marriage had been in difficulty since approximately her former husband wa a businessman he had experienced considerable financial problem since at least the de facto breakdown of their marital life had occurred in the claimant did not know anything about her husband professional activity the family had one car used essentially by the claimant former husband for business purpose however he often drove their daughter to school and the claimant to the office so that they did not have to use public transport in he left poland the party divorced in the impugned article referred to the claimant a prosecutor anna and referred to her function a the prosecutor office spokesperson the court wa of the view that it made her identity obvious to any reader familiar with legal circle in łódź it wa furthermore stated in the article that on an unspecified date she had accompanied her former husband to a meeting held somewhere in a street in łódź a certain sw remanded in custody at the time of publication of the article had told m ohb a researcher for the magazine about that transaction in which he had been involved together with pt a suspect in another set in criminal proceeding pt wa also remanded in custody at the time of publication pt had been the claimant former husband business partner since approximately he had never met the claimant but had known that she wa a prosecutor the journalist msz who wrote the article using a pseudonym had failed to take into consideration the fact that sw wa remanded in custody and that he had therefore had an interest in blackening the prosecutor name since she had been involved in certain case against him his statement should therefore not have been taken at face value m ohb had met sw in prison posing a a relative however neither the journalist nor the editor had taken any step with a view to contacting pt in order to obtain information from him that would have corroborated sw allegation the court found that the author had failed to make reasonable effort to contact the claimant before publication the effort on the part of the researcher and the journalist to get in touch with her had been completely inadequate all the more so given that they were seasoned professional the journalist maintained that he tried to call the claimant at her office at least fifty time but the evidence available to the court did not support his statement it wa further noted that other journalist had managed to contact her via her office which cast doubt on the veracity of his statement no reasonable ground had been adduced to demonstrate that it had not been possible for the defendant to get in touch with a wellknown prosecutor working at a publicly known address namely that of the prosecutor office the court noted that the claimant had acted a a prosecutor in certain criminal case against sw and pt in criminal proceeding against them in which they had been convicted of drug trafficking they had told the court that they had sold g of amphetamine to the prosecutor former husband in the presence of an unknown blonde woman who wa allegedly waiting in the car the criminal court noted that sw had told the court that the claimant former husband had informed him at the time of the transaction that the woman with him wa his wife the civil court observed that the identity of that woman had never been corroborated by any other evidence when questioned before the civil court sw stated that he had seen the woman for a matter of second and remembered that she wa blonde but did not recognise the claimant the court further observed that the claimant former husband against whom criminal proceeding were pending at that time had gone into hiding and it had been impossible to establish his whereabouts in order to make him testify in the case the court found having heard three witness from the claimant professional working environment that the impugned article made her identity obvious to anyone working in prosecutor office and to the police in łódź the article had given rise to numerous comment and conversation it wa regarded a an attempt to blacken the claimant name and to slander her motivated by the wish to damage her reputation and call into question her moral standing and professional principle it wa noted that she had been attacked by a criminal who had provided information to the journalist concerning his own criminal case after the article wa published many people did not know how to behave towards the claimant or what to think of her an embarrassing silence descended when she joined in conversation the claimant had suffered serious stress and had felt seriously wronged by the impugned article the court concluded that the article breached the claimant personal right blackened her reputation and exposed her to difficulty and disrepute in her professional and social life it lacked objectivity and wa onesided it tone wa unduly sensationalist and it presented mere conjecture a hard fact the court reiterated that a person exercising a public office should accept that his or her activity were to be assessed by the public opinion and had to accept public criticism it noted that freedom of expression could not be understood a arbitrariness it referred to the provision of section of the press act which obliged journalist to present true fact to the public the court further relied on numerous judgment of the supreme court by which that court had stressed that journalist were obliged to exercise particular diligence when gathering material and publishing article such diligence wa called for inter alia a regard the obligation to check the veracity of information obtained from third party in the present case such diligence had not been exercised while it wa true that the claimant former husband had purchased amphetamine from sw and pt no evidence had been presented to the court to show that the claimant had been present at the scene let alone acting a security for the transaction the court observed taking due note of the financial statement of the applicant company for that it wa in a good financial position and that pln in damage wa therefore an appropriate award in the circumstance of the present case the court questioned the journalist msz the researcher m ohb pt sw and three other witness a to the impact that the article had had in the claimant professional environment the court referred to a note and an email from the prosecutor office listing the people who had tried to contact the claimant by phone and to the list of phone call made to her office the applicant company appealed referring inter alia to article of the convention it submitted that the firstinstance court had erred in holding that the impugned article breached the claimant personal right given that the defendant had been motivated by the desire to protect socially justified interest that the court had refused to take evidence from the file of two criminal case with a view to establishing that the claimant had been present at the scene of the transaction and that the court had been arbitrary in establishing that the claimant had not known either what her former husband did for a living or the purpose of the meeting in the street that the information contained in the article had made it possible for reader to identify the claimant and that she had been ostracised by her colleague a a result of the article by a judgment of december the łódź court of appeal dismissed the appeal it shared the conclusion of the lower court a to the applicant company failure to act with the diligence which could and should be expected of journalist it stressed that the journalist and the researcher had failed to seek information that could have countered their version of event or dispelled doubt a to the fact it endorsed the lower court conclusion that the transaction itself had indeed taken place but that the claimant alleged involvement in it had been presented in a tendentious and unreliable manner the court referred to article of the convention and held that the interference wa necessary a the applicant company had breached the claimant right through it insinuation which were not based to any reasonable degree on the available evidence on january the supreme court dismissed the applicant company cassation appeal it observed that the impugned article concerned an event which had indeed occurred namely a drugtrafficking transaction between the claimant former husband and pt and sw however the allegation that the claimant had knowingly participated in that transaction a well a insinuation that she wa a drug addict and that she had been passing on drug on her fellow prosecutor were in the light of the evidence gathered in the case entirely unfounded her right had been thereby breached the supreme court referred to it own caselaw to the effect that journalist were obliged to be diligent when gathering material for the purpose of their article but that at the same time they had a right to draw their own conclusion from material thus gathered i ck the press act obliged them to comply with the obligation of diligence by contacting person about whom they wished to write prior to the publication of such material i csk such an obligation wa all the more important in the present case because given the claimant prosecutorial function in case against pt and sw the testimony of the latter could not be accepted uncritically the journalist had failed to try to contact the claimant had accepted sw statement in an undiscriminating manner and had failed to contact pt prior to publishing the article the supreme court acknowledged that shocking or even insulting publication were also covered by the protection of article of the convention however this protection wa not absolute it could be limited by the legitimate aim listed in paragraph of this provision journalist making allegation about individual were obliged to show that there wa sufficient factual basis for their assertion here it referred to cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no echr xi not only should statement of fact be consistent with the material gathered for the purpose of the press article but value judgment should also have a sound factual basis here it cited dąbrowski v poland no december these principle were equally applicable to situation where the administration of justice or judge or prosecutor were criticised by the press citing barfod v denmark february series a no prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no and lešník v slovakia no echr iv the supreme court reiterated that informing the general public of improper conduct on the part of public prosecutor served the general interest but the guarantee enshrined in article could be successfully relied on only where journalist had reliable and precise information at their disposal that could justify levelling such serious charge against public official no such factual information had been put forward by the defendant in the present case the court had not therefore erred in finding against them ii relevant domestic law article of the constitution provides a follows the republic of poland shall ensure freedom of the press and other mean of social communication article of the constitution which lay down a general prohibition on disproportionate limitation of constitutional right and freedom the principle of proportionality provides any limitation of the exercise of constitutional freedom and right may be imposed only by statute and only when necessary in a democratic state for the protection of it security or public order or to protect the natural environment health or public

convention the applicant company complained that the court judgment in it case had violated it right to freedom of expression a provided in article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be

for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a admissibility the court note that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party submission the government submitted that the interference with the applicant company right had been compatible with article of the convention there wa no doubt that it had had a basis in law and had served the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or right of others a to whether the interference had been necessary in a democratic society the government averred that the statement contained in the impugned article had for the most part been statement of fact it had been stated that the then minister of justice and prosecutor general were tolerating a prosecutor who wa a drug dealer furthermore it had been stated a a fact that the claimant had been present at the scene of the drug transaction a a guarantee of security although the claimant had not been referred to by her full name a detailed description had made her identity obvious to local legal circle in particular a her position a spokesperson for the appellate prosecutor office had been mentioned one of the witness had confirmed this the claimant had suffered negative consequence immediately after the article had been published the government averred that the domestic court had found that the allegation about the claimant conduct had not been confirmed by the evidence taken during the proceeding although the drug transaction between the claimant former husband on the one hand and pt and sw on the other had taken place the claimant presence at the scene had not been confirmed the witness had seen a woman inside the car but they had not known the claimant personally and had not recognised her before the civil court they had only referred to the fact that her former husband had told them at that time that it wa her she had not seen him since when he had abandoned the family the government submitted that the allegation of drug trafficking levelled against the claimant who wa a public official were of a very serious character the subject matter of the case wa therefore of general public concern however the applicant company had failed to comply with it duty a the journalist had not acted with due diligence and had failed to verify the information on which their allegation were based they should have relied on a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis since the more serious the allegation the more solid the factual basis must be crucially the journalist had failed to contact the claimant the government submitted that the journalist had had recourse to unnecessarily sensational and provocative language admittedly journalistic freedom also covered possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation however in a political context it wa legitimate to ensure that debate observed a minimum degree of moderation and propriety the same applied to public official such a prosecutor the domestic court had established that the allegation concerning the claimant had been in breach of her personal right a they had had adverse consequence for her private and professional life the court had provided extensive reasoning in support of their decision relying essentially on the journalist failure to contact the claimant and pt on their lack of reasonable effort to verify sw submission against other information and on their uncritical acceptance of sw story the government were of the view that the reason relied on by the domestic court had been both relevant and sufficient a regard the nature and severity of the penalty imposed on the applicant company the government argued that no criminal proceeding had been instituted in the present case the applicant company had been held liable under the provision of the civil law only the łódź regional court had merely ordered the apology to be published in the form requested by the claimant the domestic court order for the payment of pln a compensation and to cover the claimant legal cost had borne a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the damage she had suffered the compensation had been based on a careful examination of the applicant company financial statement for the previous year and had thus not been excessive the government concluded that court had struck a fair balance between the restriction of the applicant company freedom of expression and the claimant reputation the applicant company submitted that a situation where a public prosecutor former husband had been involved in drug trafficking and the prosecutor had herself participated in an illegal transaction called for the closest public scrutiny that situation had justified the strong language used in the article the motivation of the magazine editor had not been idle curiosity but the question of whether the state should tolerate the shocking conduct of it official at the material time the magazine had been opposed to the government in power it conduct should in fact be regarded a diligent restrained and moderate in the impugned article the claimant had been referred to merely a prosecutor anna the court dealing with the case had entirely failed to take into consideration the fact that a person with her position and visibility should be beyond reproach the applicant company wa further of the view that the statement referred to by the government were for the most part not statement of fact but rather value judgment her highly inappropriate presence at the scene of the drug trafficking offence had been confirmed by the testimony given by the witness her presence had been intended to serve a a security measure for the illegal transaction this assessment of the situation by the author of the article should also have been seen a a value judgment in any event the statement had a sufficient basis in the material available to the court the claimant had been present at the scene and had subsequently confirmed this in the proceeding saying that she could not rule out that she might have been in the car at that time even assuming that she had been unaware of the nature of the transaction her lack of vigilance should be seen a disqualifying her from serving a a prosecutor the applicant company further submitted that the national court had found it well established that the information about the claimant contained in the text made her identity obvious to the public this assumption had been borne out by the testimony given to the court by her friend pk an officer of the special police force however he had also said that only people who knew her would have been able to make out her identity on the basis of that information the applicant company submitted that the allegation had had a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis when preparing the article m ohb had met sw one of the drug dealer and interviewed him she had also sent a letter to the spokesman for the prosecutor office asking whether any disciplinary proceeding had been instituted against any prosecutor in łódź there had been no reply to that letter the applicant company argued that the crucial issue for the case wa that the claimant a highprofile prosecutor had been present at the scene of the drugtrafficking offence no appropriate explanation had ever been provided she should have been dismissed from her position instead she had won a case against the proopposition magazine which had been critical of the moral condition of the prosecuting authority the claimant had not suffered any negative consequence the witness before the court said that they were aware of a funny article and that there were some mean comment the claimant did not specify what negative consequence she had suffered no disciplinary proceeding against her had been instituted and she had been neither dismissed nor transferred to another prosecutor office the applicant company reiterated that the freedom of the press wa strongly protected under article of the convention the press could have recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation it cited prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no it wa allowed to use sarcastic satirical or inelegant language referring to nikowitz and verlagsgruppe news gmb h v austria no february it wa the right of the press to be shocking offensive and disturbing and the test of proportionality should focus on whether a proper balance had been struck between the legal interest involved that had not been the case in the proceeding concerned in the present case the press could be expected to be unbiased and neutral in the form of expression it cited for example standard verlagsgesellschaft mb h v austria no no february the magazine published by the applicant company wa of a generally satirical character and consequently the article concerned had also been couched in satirical term satirical statement concerning matter of public interest were by their very nature exaggerated and distorting and a such they enjoyed a wider margin of tolerance it cited for example alves da silva v portugal no october a to the penalty imposed on the applicant company it had not been proportionate in the circumstance of the present case the applicant company concluded that the interference complained of wa in the circumstance of the present case in breach of the proportionality requirement imposed on the state under article of the convention the court assessment the court reiterates that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment see lingens v austria july series a no in this context the safeguard to be afforded to the press are of particular importance see janowski v poland gc no echr i not only doe the press have the task of imparting information and idea the public also ha a right to receive them were it otherwise the press would be unable to play it vital role of public watchdog in imparting information of serious public concern see among other authority observer and guardian v the united kingdom november series a no gawęda v poland no echr ii and kaperzyński v poland no april although the press must not overstep certain bound in particular in respect of the reputation and right of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information it duty is nevertheless to impart information and idea on all matter of public interest see jersild v denmark september series a no series a no p and de haes and gijsels v belgium february report of judgment and decision i nonetheless article of the convention doe not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matter of serious public concern under the term of paragraph of this article freedom of expression carry with it duty and responsibility hence the safeguard afforded by article to journalist in relation to reporting on issue of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethic of journalism see for example goodwin v the united kingdom march report of judgment and decision ii fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i pedersen and baadsgaard v denmark gc no echr xi lindon otchakovsky laurens and july v france gc no and echr iv and kania and kittel v poland no june in it practice the court ha distinguished between statement of fact and value judgment while the existence of fact can be demonstrated the truth of value judgment is not susceptible of proof where a statement amount to a value judgment the proportionality of the interference may depend on whether or not there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement since even a value judgment may be excessive if it ha no factual basis to support it see de haes and gijsels cited above and feldek v slovakia no echr viii the more serious such an allegation the more solid the factual basis ha to be see pedersen and baadsgaard cited above mc vicar v the united kingdom no echr iii and bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc no the court observes that in the present case the domestic court decision complained of by the applicant company amounted to interference with the exercise of it right to freedom of expression the court also find that the interference complained of wa prescribed by law namely article and of the civil code and wa intended to pursue one of the legitimate aim referred to in article of the convention namely to protect the reputation or right of others hence the only point at issue is whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society to achieve that aim the test of necessity in a democratic society requires the court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a pressing social need whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason given by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient see among many other authority the sunday time v the united kingdom no april series a no and skałka v poland no may in assessing whether such a need exists and what measure should be adopted to deal with it the national authority are left a certain margin of appreciation this power of appreciation is not however unlimited but go hand in hand with european supervision by the court whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article in sum the court task in exercising it supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authority but rather to review under article in the light of the case a a whole the decision they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation see among many other authority fressoz and roire cited above axel springer ag v germany gc no february von hannover v germany no gc no and echr the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are also factor which should be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article skałka cited above and kwiecień v poland no january the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith the court must look at the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression in the light of the case a a whole including the statement concerned and the context in which they were made and also the particular circumstance of those involved see feldek cited above the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact see among many other authority hertel v switzerland august report of judgment and decision vi pedersen and baadsgaard cited above steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii and mamère v france no echr xiii in the instant case the impugned article published in contained allegation that the claimant who wa a prosecutor at the local public prosecutor office at the material time had been involved in drug trafficking the article alleged that she had been present at a meeting held on an unspecified date in a street in łódź while her former husband wa purchasing amphetamine from certain person against whom criminal proceeding were pending at the time of the publication it further alleged that the prosecuting authority knew about her involvement in the alleged drug trafficking but chose not to prosecute her it also insinuated that she wa a drug addict herself and that it wa likely that she wa sharing drug with her colleague see paragraph above the court ha stated on many occasion that issue concerning the functioning of the justice system constitute question of public interest see kudeshkina v russia no february mutatis mutandis public prosecutor are civil servant whose task it is to contribute to the proper administration of justice in this respect they form part of the judicial machinery in the broader sense of this term see lešník cited above the court take note of the applicant argument that the character of the claimant public function wa such a to justify close public scrutiny see paragraph above the court accepts that personal integrity of public prosecutor is a subject which may be of legitimate interest to the general public however it may be necessary to protect public servant from offensive abusive and defamatory attack which are likely to affect them in the performance of their duty and to damage public confidence in them and the office they hold see janowski gc cited above and lešník cited above the extent to which such protection might be deemed necessary depends on the particular circumstance of the case whilst in the present case the applicant company considered that it wa it duty to alert the public to an important issue of general interest the fact that the article concerned a prosecutor did not exempt it from the obligation to provide a sufficient factual basis for the allegation a regard the categorisation of the statement contained in the article the court observes that the polish court considered in their analysis that the statement concerning the transaction itself were not devoid of any factual basis however the court found that the same could not be said of the statement by sw to the effect that the claimant had been aware of and had participated in the transaction still le that she had acted a illicit protection for her former husband in this connection the court found that sw had never met the claimant that he had relied only on what her former husband had told him and crucially that he had not recognised the claimant before the civil court taken a a whole the court found that the statement contained in the article referring to the claimant conduct both in connection with the drugtrafficking transaction and the insinuation concerning her alleged involvement in drug trafficking were not supported by the evidence the court note that the domestic court took into consideration the fact that the applicant company had invoked article of the convention during the proceeding the firstinstance court referred to the caselaw of the supreme court regarding the obligation of journalist to exercise diligence see paragraph above it also applied the test of adequate diligence in assessing whether the journalist had discharged their obligation the firstinstance court found that the journalist had not exercised sufficient diligence when making their allegation about the claimant involvement which were in the court view not sufficiently supported by the fact in particular the firstinstance court regarded the effort of the researcher and the journalist to get in touch with the claimant a completely inadequate and observed that no evidence had been submitted showing that msz had indeed tried to call her before publication of the impugned article likewise in their successive decision the court criticised the fact that neither the journalist nor the editor had got in touch with pt who had been present at the scene during the transaction and could have confirmed the claimant identity and involvement or dispelled any doubt in that regard in it detailed analysis the supreme court subsequently referred to the caselaw of the court and to the principle formulated in connection with the exercise of the freedom of expression in particular the supreme court noted the distinction which had to be made between fact and value judgment it carried out a careful balancing exercise between the interest involved see semik orzech v poland no november compare and contrast keller v hungary dec no april and kwiecień cited above the court is therefore satisfied that the approach taken by the court is compatible with the freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention contrast sokołowski v poland no march zakharov v russia no and october and karman v russia no and december furthermore a regard the reason cited by the court to justify the interference with the applicant company right to freedom of expression the court observed that the thrust of the allegation against the claimant concerned her alleged involvement in the drug trafficking transaction consequently the court focused their examination on this essential aspect of the case a to whether these ground were sufficient the court note that with a view to establishing the impact which the article had had on the claimant professional life and reputation the firstinstance court heard evidence from seven witness namely the author of the article the researcher working for the applicant company both individual who had participated in the transaction and three further witness it also had regard to documentary evidence gathered for the purpose of establishing the measure taken by the journalist in an effort to contact the claimant prior to publication in the light of the above the court concludes that the domestic authority when justifying the interference concerned in the present case relied on ground which were both relevant and sufficient the applicant company did not argue that the court refused to gather evidence which it considered to be relevant for the outcome of the case the court is therefore satisfied that the polish court gave the applicant company ample opportunity to demonstrate that it allegation had a sufficient factual basis contrast sabou and pircalab v romania no september see also wołek kasprów and łęski v poland dec no october the court further observes that the applicant company wa found only to be civilly liable no criminal proceeding were instituted against them by the prosecution authority the court further note that the applicant company wa ordered to publish an apology in their newspaper for having published inaccurate information of a defamatory character the correction wa neutrally worded no bad faith or lack of diligence on the applicant part being implied furthermore the court reiterates that in specific circumstance an exceptional and particularly high amount of damage for libel see tolstoy miloslavsky v the united kingdom july series a no b and independent news and medium and independent newspaper ireland limited v ireland no echr v extract may raise an issue under article of the convention however in the present case the court when deciding on the amount to be paid by the applicant company a compensation had regard to it financial situation and held that the amount of pln wa not excessive it ha not been argued let alone shown that that amount wa such a to threaten the economic foundation of the applicant company in any way having regard to the circumstance of the case a a whole the court is of the view that the interference complained of may be viewed a necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of paragraph of article of the convention there ha therefore been no violation of that article for these reason the court unanimously declares the application admissible hold that there ha

issuing tax rescript that were advantageous to these multinational company in the same context it also stated that under the caselaw of the european court of human right the lawfulness or illegality of the disclosed act or conduct is not a criterion in decided whether to grant whistleblower status since the disclosed information might even concern a particular shortcoming or questionable practice a to the merit the court of appeal decided for various reason related to the domestic criminal law not to examine certain charge brought against ad or the applicant namely breaching commercial secrecy or accordingly laundering and possession or laundering and possession of the proceeds of computerrelated fraud it ruled that in the light of the domestic criminal law alone the firstinstance court had been correct in finding that ad and the applicant had committed the offence of theft from one employer fraudulent or retained access to a data processing or automatic transmission system breach of professional confidence and laundering and possession of the proceeds of theft from one employer it held that contrary to the finding of the firstinstance court ep ought to have been regarded a complicit in the breach of professional confidence committed by the applicant and in the laundering and possession of the proceeds of theft from one employer also committed by him the court of appeal then examined whether or not these offence which had been established and were in principle to be considered a proven could be held to be justified under article of the convention it explained that under luxembourg law the acceptance of whistleblowing a a defence derived from article of the convention had the effect of neutralising the illegal nature of the breach of the law it specified that it wa the statutory element of the offence which wa necessarily committed through the disclosure in good faith and in a proportionate and appropriate manner of information in the general interest which wa thus neutralised and led to the defendant acquittal with regard to ep it held that he wa to be recognised a enjoying the defence of having acted a a responsible journalist derived by the court from article of the convention in consequence it confirmed on this ground eps full acquittal with regard to ad and the applicant it applied the court caselaw on the protection of whistleblower referring in particular to guja v moldova gc no echr it reiterated that this caselaw made protection of whistleblower subject to compliance with six condition which it then analysed it reasoning may be summarised

the way for a public debate in europe and luxembourg about the taxation of multinational company fiscal transparency the practice of tax rescript and tax fairness in general it added that following the luxleaks disclosure the european commission had presented a range of measure against tax evasion and an action plan for fair and effective corporate taxation in the european union the court of appeal also held that the information disclosed had been authentic the second criterion with regard to the third criterion namely that disclosing the information to the public could only be considered a a last resort where it wa clearly impracticable to do otherwise the court of appeal considered that having regard to the circumstance of the case informing the public through the medium had been the only realistic alternative in order to raise the alert it accepted that the fourth criterion that of good faith had been met in the applicant case in the case of ad it held that this criterion had been complied with in the summer of when he handed over the document which he had taken in october to ep in contrast it held that ad had not complied with this criterion when taking possession of the document given that he had not yet intended at that point to make them public analysis of the fifth guja criterion the court of appeal then analysed the criterion which required the public interest in obtaining the information to be balanced against the harm suffered by the employer a a result of the information revealed the fifth criterion in so far a the applicant argued that pw c had not suffered any harm pointing out that the company had even announced an increase in it turnover and number of employee the court of appeal after reviewing the court various judgment in this area noted a follows the european court doe not analyse the harm sustained in specific term but considers that the harm caused to the employer may result from damage to it image loss of confidence and in general from the impact that the report may have had on the public the higher the public profile of the case and thus of the information that the employer wished to keep secret the more the public confidence is shaken it also stated there is accordingly no need to ascertain whether a a result of ad and the applicant disclosure pw c turnover ha decreased or whether client have complained brought civilliability proceeding or closed their account with pw cthe court of appeal note that the fact of disclosing document subject to business and professional secrecy ha certainly caused harm to pw c specifically nonpecuniary harm a a victim of criminal offence resulting from the damage to it reputation and the loss of client confidence with regard to the security procedure in place in the company furthermore and more specifically in the context of the information provided concerning the applicant it pointed out that in the present case pw c ha been associated with a practice of tax evasion if not with a taxoptimisation procedure described a unacceptable it ha been the victim of criminal offence and ha necessarily suffered harm it went on to weigh up the public interest on the one hand against pw c interest on the other and found with regard to ad that the public interest clearly outweighed any harm that may have been sustained by pw c and it client it therefore held that this criterion had been complied with in respect of ad in contrast in the applicant case the court of appeal held that the disclosure of the document had caused pw c harm that wa greater than the general interest with the result that the fifth criterion had not been fulfilled it found that the defence argument that the applicant should be granted whistleblower status could not be accepted for the following reason the document handed over by the applicant to the journalist did not contribute to the public debate on the luxembourg practice of tax rescript trigger a debate on tax evasion or provide essential new and previously unknown information in reaching this conclusion it relied on the following argument in contrast to the document disclosed by ad the document selected by the applicant were not administrative ruling and did not illustrate the application of the tax rescript system they were simple tax declaration that is unilateral statement by taxpayer concerning their financial situation which did not permit the tax authority attitude towards them to be ascertained thus these document did not reveal any information about the tax optimisation technique and were of limited relevance nor had they been selected by the applicant in order to provide additional information about the tax rescript already in the possession of ep for example in order to illustrate how these tax rescript were reflected in the corresponding tax declaration they had been selected solely on the basis of how wellknown the relevant taxpayer wa when the applicant appropriated the document and transmitted them to the journalist the practice of tax rescript had already been disclosed through the document which were transmitted by ad and publicised on the occasion of the first cash investigation programme the applicant had been aware of this circumstance thus there had been no compelling reason for the applicant to commit a fresh violation of the law by appropriating and disclosing confidential document the document had been used by ep to prepare a part of the second cash investigation programme a section on tax evasion and the billion we are missing rather than on the practice of tax rescript the document were used to illustrate tax evasion by two group of multinational company a and am explored in the report according to ep in the case of company a the tax declaration had allowed him to illustrate that the group had declared a significant turnover in luxembourg without however engaging in the corresponding commercial activity in that country the journalist criticised the following procedure with regard to company am he reported that this group had transferred eur million to a subsidiary governed by luxembourg law in order to repay the interest on a loan that it had granted to this subsidiary the subsidiary wa able to deduct the amount in question which wa then transferred to another company in the same group located in dubai where it enjoyed full tax exemption the court of appeal considered that the information in relation to the two group of company could admittedly be regarded a alarming and scandalous but that it did not constitute essential or fundamentally new information thus it concluded that the tax return handed over by the applicant merely confirmed the result of the journalistic investigation carried out by eps team and that a such they were certainly useful to the journalist but did not however provide any previously unknown cardinal information capable of relaunching or contributing to the debate on tax evasion analysis of the sixth guja criterion with regard to the sixth criterion concerning the proportionality of the penalty the court of appeal made a distinction between the two defendant it held that ad who wa entitled to rely on the defence of whistleblowing with regard to the offence of handing over the document to the journalist ep in the summer of wa to be absolved of any criticism with regard to those event and thus acquitted of the offence of a breach of professional secrecy with regard to those of his action that were not covered by this defence namely those concerning the appropriation of document in october the court of appeal reduced the prison sentence to six month suspended in it entirety and upheld the fine of eur with regard to the applicant the court of appeal held that there had been a plurality of offence so that under the domestic criminal law the most severe penalty could be doubled namely a prison term of between three month and five year and a fine of eur to noting also that the applicant could not benefit from the defence of having acted a a whistleblower it decided nonetheless to have regard a an extenuating circumstance to the motive honourable in his view which had driven him to act and to the disinterested nature of his act in consequence it decided not to impose a prison term and to maintain the fine of eur the court of appeal upheld the civillaw judgment ordering ad and the applicant to pay the symbolic sum of one euro a compensation for the nonpecuniary damage sustained by pw c the court of cassations judgment in respect of ad and the applicant ad and the applicant appealed on point of law against the court of appeal judgment the court of cassations judgment in respect of the applicant in a judgment no criminal division of january the court of cassation dismissed the applicant appeal on point of law the applicant had submitted a legal argument alleging a violation by the court of appeal of article of the convention stating inter alia the court of appeal ha misrepresented the fact and the caselaw of the european court of human right and interpreted in a tendentious manner the limited relevance of the document handed over to ep leading it to find that the harm suffered by the employer wa greater than the general interest and to reject the defence of whistleblowing given it conclusion that the criterion of the proportionality of the harm caused in relation to the general interest wa not fulfilled in the discussion of the argument the applicant had emphasised by way of example that the appendix to the tax return filed by group a see paragraph above referred to annual general meeting which had an average duration of one minute which sufficed to demonstrate a total lack of genuine substance in luxembourg he stressed that the tax return that he had communicated made it possible to verify the economic reality of the entity set up in luxembourg and thus to analyse the practice of using tax rescript in response to this argument the court of cassation held inter alia assessment of the fact which must underlie a decision a to whether a defendant can benefit from the defence of whistleblower status fall within the sovereign domain of the judge invested with jurisdiction over the merit and is not subject to review by the court of cassation provided that this assessment is not deduced from reason that are insufficient or contradictory in the present case the appellate court based their assessment on the nature of the document removed by the applicant the use of those document in the context of a television programme on tax evasion the statement made by the applicant and by ep concerning the relevance of the document in question and concluded that the tax return removed by the applicant while they had undoubtedly been useful to the journalist ep did not however provide any cardinal information hitherto unknown that wa capable of relaunching or contributing to the debate on tax evasion contrary to the applicant argument the factual finding reached by the appellate court are not contradictory the appellate court assessment wa thus based on reason that were adequate and free from contradiction the court of cassations judgment in respect of ad in contrast the appeal on point of law lodged by ad wa granted by the court of cassation in it judgment no criminal division of january it quashed the court of appeal judgment on the ground that whistleblower status ought in principle to be granted concerning all offence for which a person who had availed himself or herself of the right guaranteed by article of the convention wa prosecuted failing which the protection that ought to arise from whistleblower status would be rendered ineffective the court of cassation thus held that the court of appeal had infringed article of the convention by refusing to allow ad to rely on the defence of whistleblowing regarding the appropriation of the document handed over in october given that it had accepted this defence with regard to the handing over of these document to the journalist ep in the summer of d the court of appeal remittal judgment with regard to ad in a judgment of may the court of appeal held that following the court of cassations judgment ad ought to be acquitted on the basis of article of the convention of all the offence committed with regard to the document handed over to ep in the summer of including the offence related to the appropriation of these document in october the court of appeal decided however that the first appellate judgment had become final and thus remained valid in respect of ad concerning these same offence in so far a they related to the internal training document that he had also appropriated in october when appropriating the tax document that were subsequently transmitted to ep in this connection it limited itself to suspending the pronouncement of the sentence this judgment wa accepted by the party and consequently became final relevant legal framework and practicerelevant domestic law the various offence with which the applicant wa charged are provided for in the

of trade secret should not extend to case in which disclosure of a trade secret serf the public interest insofar a directly relevant misconduct wrongdoing or illegal activity is revealed this should not be seen a preventing the competent judicial authority from allowing an exception to the application of measure procedure and remedy in a case where the respondent had every reason to believe in

of europe in the judgment in the case of heinisch v germany no echr extract and bucur and toma v romania no january the court summarised resolution on the protection of whistleblower adopted by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on april another instrument wa adopted in this area by the committee of minister of the council of europe on april certain relevant passage from that recommendation cmrec were set out in the case of medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others v bosnia and herzegovina gc no june this recommendation considers that a whistleblower is any person who report or discloses information on a threat or harm to the public interest in the context of their workbased relationship whether it be in the public or private sector on june the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe adopted resolution and recommendation on improving the protection of whistleblower in the first of these text the parliamentary assembly referred to the disclosure concerning mass surveillance and intrusion of privacy carried out by the united state national security agency nsa and other intelligence agency and called for the adoption of a binding legal instrument convention on whistleblower protection on the basis of committee of minister recommendation cmrec in the second text the parliamentary assembly invited the committee of minister to promote further improvement for the protection of whistleblower by launching the process of negotiating a binding legal instrument in the form of a framework convention that would be open to nonmember state and cover disclosure of wrongdoing by person employed in the field of national security and intelligence on october the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe adopted resolution and recommendation on improving the protection of whistleblower all over europe in the first of these document the parliament assembly strongly welcomed directive eu see paragraph above and invited the member state of the council of europe which are also member of the european union to adopt it provision adding that there wa nothing to prevent them from protecting those reporting on breach or abuse of their national law according to the same principle a to the council of europe member state which are not member of the eu the parliamentary assembly invited them to revise their relevant legislation in this area or pas new law that draw on the proposal for a european directive in question in the second text the parliamentary assembly reiterated it invitation to the committee of minister to begin preparation for negotiating a binding legal instrument in the form of a council of europe convention which should draw on the abovementioned european directive taking due account of the clarification and addition proposed in resolution in it reply adopted on april the committee of minster reiterated with regard to the assembly recommendation that a legally binding instrument be drawn up the position set out in it reply to assembly recommendation it considered that given the complexity of the subject and the range of solution adopted by the member state to protect whistleblower the negotiation of a binding instrument such a a convention would be time consuming and there would be no certainty a to it outcome and that it wa at this stage more appropriate to encourage state fully to implement the recommendation which have been adopted by the committee of minister or other body the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant alleged that his conviction following his disclosure to a journalist of sixteen document emanating from his employer pw c had amounted to disproportionate interference with his right to freedom of expression he relied on article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility the government raised an objection of inadmissibility arguing that the application wa manifestly illfounded they rejected the applicant claim that among other point the court of appeal had ruled that it wa possible to circumvent the court caselaw regarding violation of article of the convention and had merely pretended to weigh up the interest referring to certain passage in the impugned judgment the government explained that the court of appeal had reiterated that it wa obliged to give full effect to convention and had then applied the court caselaw they considered the applicant assertion to be manifestly erroneous and invited the court to declare the application inadmissible in application of article a of the convention the applicant submitted in reply that through this argument the government analysed in detail the weighing up of interest conducted by the domestic court a matter which went to the merit of the case he added that the government while recognising the existence of interference with the right protected by article of the convention see paragraph below could not then contradict themselves by raising an objection arguing that the complaint which moreover they recognised a being wellfounded in part wa manifestly illfounded he therefore asked that the objection raised by the government be joined to the merit of the case and then be rejected the court considers that the argument in question raise question which require examination on the merit of the complaint under article of the convention rather than an examination of the admissibility of the complaint see mutatis mutandis gürbüz and bayar v turkey no july the court note that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground the court therefore declares it admissible merit the party submissionsa the applicant the applicant who had indicated in his application that he wa at the origin of the luxleaks case took note of the government acknowledgment that there had been an interference with his right to freedom of expression he considered that the legal question centred on the proportionality of the interference he submitted firstly that the government were attempting to carry out an innocent and objective transformation of the fact when asserting that the tax return handed over by the applicant were mere statement by the taxpayer the applicant submitted that these were on the contrary legal document drawn up and drafted by pw c on behalf of it client and invoiced to them which demonstrated the concrete existence of the tax arrangement contained in the tax rescript the creation of luxembourg and offshore company movement of capital inside group payment of dividend etc he also made various allegation and criticism with regard to the court of appeal judgment in his submission the court of appeal had held that neither the convention nor luxembourg law provided for an exemption from criminal prosecution for whistleblower with the result that article allowed only for a finding that prosecution wa not necessary in a democratic society without allowing the accused to be acquitted relaxer in luxembourg law by holding that the public interest in learning the information handed over by him wa weaker than the damage caused to pw c the court of appeal and this finding had been endorsed by the court of cassation had denied him the protection of whistleblower status since the court of appeal had judged that the compensation to be paid to the employer wa a symbolic euro the balancing exercise thus presupposed that the public interest in knowing the information in question wa in this case le than one symbolic euro that is equal to zero however a the court of appeal had not claimed that the value of the information provided by the applicant wa nonexistent it had only pretended to balance the interest the domestic court had noted that there wa indeed a defence ground in the present case which could have led to the applicant acquittal but having regard to the circumstance they decided that the applicant could rely only on a lesser protection that of an acknowledgement of extenuating circumstance there had been no objective reason to distinguish ad treatment from his in that they had both been employee and had been equally linked to the document leak which resulted in the luxleaks scandal the information revealed by him had strengthened ad position submitting that his criminal conviction could have been motivated by only one concern it deterrent function he considered that the existence of this penalty wa in itself sufficient to justify the finding of a violation of article of the convention lastly he reiterated and endorsed the thirdpartys observation which could be summarised a follows accepting the three new criterion of essential new and previously unknown information a the court of appeal had done see paragraph above would have serious repercussion on the effectiveness of the protection afforded to whistleblower firstly the addition of such criterion would result in legal uncertainty thus the criterion of the essential nature of the information disclosed would introduce legal vagueness since this concept wa insufficiently precise furthermore it would be difficult for the court to apply this criterion which wa unprecedented and absent from any of the law or caselaw in the state which protected whistleblower it would give rise to a range of interpretation the criterion of new information would result in a reduction in the number of alert particularly where an alert concerned information relating to fact that were already known but had not been addressed in the past the french case of céline boussié who had raised the alert in about abuse of child with disability which wa already known and had been denounced by her former colleague since the late s wa one example lastly with regard to the criterion of previously unknown information it might be necessary in a democratic society for the disclosure of additional evidence unknown but helping to draw attention to fact that were previously known and had been denounced to constitute an ethical warning that deserved protection under article of the convention secondly it would be impossible in practice for whistleblower to fulfil these new criterion the six criterion adopted by the court none of which referred to assessment of the new essential or previously unknown nature of the relevant information had enabled a satisfactory balance to be struck between the interest of employer and the public right to information this approach by the court wa compatible with the existing international standard and in particular with the european directive adopted in this area which a a general rule required only a reasonable belief in the accuracy of what wa being complained about excluding any prior assessment of whether the information wa new previously unknown or essential moreover this approach wa appropriate in term of the profile of whistleblower who in a world of digital network had extremely easy access to a very large amount of information in this context the model of the guja caselaw wa a safeguard against illegal leak in that it made it possible to guarantee that the information disclosed wa genuinely in the public interest however if whistleblower were persuaded that they could no longer be protected they would be encouraged to leak information anonymously furthermore the new criterion used by the court of appeal would a an indirect effect weaken the state obligation to investigate violation of human right the public authority would thus be relieved of their responsibility to conduct investigation into the fact disclosed by whistleblower and to decide on whether or not it wa appropriate to prosecute the presumed offender where an alert wa raised long before the harm emerged and whistleblower were therefore unable to ground their allegation on a sufficient factual basis only an investigation by the public authority would allow for the entire problem to which the whistleblower had only partial access to be brought to light example from the court caselaw showed that protection had been granted to whistleblower who had disclosed without necessarily being able to adduce conclusive proof information drawing attention to the existence of environmental damage breach of the physical integrity of individual or violation of the right which contributed to the pluralism typifying society lastly over and above these problem the new criterion used by the court of appeal would also lead to an interference with the right of journalist and watchdog of democracy whistleblower were already hesitant to alert the public on account of the possible severe consequence for their personal situation the adoption of the abovementioned criterion would have an additional dissuasive effect on journalist potential whistleblowing source the publicwatchdog role of the medium could thus be undermined in many case the right of journalist to protect their source wa closely linked to the need to protect the disclosure of information by whistleblower in conclusion requiring that the information handed over by whistleblower to the press be essential new and previously unknown and denying protection in that connection would necessarily undermine the protection of source and could deter whistleblower from working with journalistsb the government the government disputed the applicant allegation that he had been at the origin of the luxleaks case according to the government it wa ad who had been the source of the disclosure both in chronological perspective term and with regard to the number and nature of the document disclosed ad revelation had illustrated how the tax authority had dealt with the company concerned while in contrast those of the applicant had merely been straightforward unilateral tax return which had not shed light on the practice of tax rescript it wa the qualitative difference between the document handed over by ad and those transmitted by the applicant which explained why the former had been acquitted while the latter had merely been granted the benefit of extenuating circumstance however the government acknowledged that given that the applicant had been punished by the criminal and civil court for having handed over document to a journalist who subsequently published them there had been an interference with his right to freedom of expression they noted that the applicant referred only to the issue of the proportionality of the interference and thus did not question the fact that it had been prescribed by law and that it pursued a legitimate aim with regard to issue of proportionality the government considered that the court of appeal had scrupulously analysed the six criterion laid down in the court caselaw in this aera a they applied to the applicant they stated that the court assessment could concern only criterion and the only one in respect of which the applicant challenged the merit of the court of appeal analysis the government began by rejecting the applicant assertion that they had transformed the fact pointing out that they had confined themselves to summarising faithfully what they considered to be the relevant finding by the domestic court they also considered it their duty to address the criticism made by the applicant of the court of appeal judgment see paragraph above thus the applicant had reached his conclusion regarding the failure to acquit him from a citation taken out of context of a passage in the court of appeal judgment without having regard to the subsequent reasoning the government pointed out that according to the court of appeal even in the absence of a special express and formal legal provision an acquittal could be based on a defence ground sui generis and where a criminal conviction wa in breach of the protection granted by the court under article of the convention the whistleblower could benefit from this ground which had the effect of neutralising the unlawfulness of the breach of the law and would result in a defendant acquittal the applicant had not been denied any protection under article of the convention in that the court of appeal had had regard in imposing the sentence to the applicant motif and to the disinterested nature of his action which had been recognised a extenuating circumstance nor had the judge merely pretended to ass his case a the applicant claimed the court of appeal in awarding one symbolic euro in respect of the nonpecuniary damage sustained by the civil party had not held that the damage sustained by it wa limited to one euro in the civil proceeding pw c had for it own reason chosen not to claim compensation for pecuniary damage or to attempt to ass the real value of the nonpecuniary damage since under domestic law the court of appeal could not award a sum greater than that claimed it had thus confined itself to assessing whether the civil party had sustained nonpecuniary damage at least equivalent to the amount claimed on the other hand it had given a detailed ruling on the damage suffered by pw c when in full compliance with the court caselaw it had assessed the criterion of how the interest at stake were weighed up in so far a the applicant alleged that he had been afforded only lesser protection see paragraph above the government replied that contrary to the applicant assertion the court of appeal had not found that the circumstance were such a to enable him to rely on the protection of article of the convention but on the contrary had found that the applicant wa not entitled to benefit from the defence of whistleblowing see paragraph above with regard to the fifth criterion the court of appeal had found giving relevant reason that real and definite harm had been sustained and had then weighed this against the public interest in being informed of the content of the document disclosed by the applicant the court of appeal had carried out a detailed analysis of the evidence holding that the applicant disclosure of the document had served neither to supplement ad prior revelation about luxembourg administrative practice of tax rescript nor to demonstrate it the government also submitted that the relevance of the document disclosed by the applicant had been limited to enabling the journalist ep to illustrate a report describing the fact which wa neither new nor original that in order to limit their tax burden group of multinational company were taking advantage of the lack of international harmonisation in the area of tax legislation thus contrary to the disclosure made by ad the document handed over by the applicant had served only to illustrate the fact wellknown and in itself unexceptional that company in order to reduce their tax burden structured their asset by creating subsidiary but were not relevant to establish or illustrate that the use of these structure had been approved in advance by the authority or to understand the scale scope and systematic nature of the tax optimisation technique approved in advance by the authority in the context of the tax rescript revealed by luxleaks a to the sixth criterion the proportionality of the penalty and it dissuasive effect had to be assessed in relation to an individual who did not meet all the criterion for whistleblower status a the court of appeal had found that the fifth criterion wa not met in the applicant case his situation wa different from that of individual who met all the criterion for being regarded a whistleblower the court of appeal had found that the applicant wa entitled to protection under article of the convention although he could not rely on the defence of whistleblowing thus in application of the court caselaw the court of appeal had applied a lower level of protection by enabling the applicant to benefit from extenuating circumstance in imposing a sentence that wa limited to a relatively low fine the court of appeal had taken into consideration his motif and the disinterested nature of his action the government concluded that in the particular circumstance of the case the fine could not be considered a either disproportionate nor a having a dissuasive effect on the exercise of the applicant freedom of expression or that of other employeesc the thirdparty intervener the association maison de lanceurs dalerte in it capacity a a thirdparty intervener stressed the serious interest of the present case since it required the court to rule on the method of assessing the proportionality of interference with the freedom of expression of whistleblower through a representative sample of the legal system which have put in place legislation to protect whistleblower it set out the definition adopted in this area in the relevant text referring to the court caselaw it emphasised that the only criterion taken into consideration by the court had never required an assessment of the essential new and previously unknown nature of the information a had occurred in the present case the court assessmenta the appliable principle the fundamental principle concerning the question of whether an interference with freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society are well established in the court caselaw and have been summarised a follows see among other authority magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no november i freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society a set forth in article this freedom is subject to exception which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article iii the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact more specifically in the context of the signalling by employee of illegal conduct or wrongdoing observed by them in the workplace the court ha identified certain fundamental principle underlying the assessment of whether an interference with the right to freedom of expression wa proportionate thus the court must have regard to several factor namely the public interest in the disclosed information it authenticity the availability of alternative channel for making the disclosure the employee good faith the damage to the employer and the severity of the penalty see guja v moldova gc no echr heinisch cited above and bucur and toma cited above and b application of the abovementioned principle to the present casei whether there ha been an interference it is not disputed between the party that the applicant conviction for having transmitted confidential document to a journalist who had then published them constituted an interference in the exercise of his freedom of expression reiterating that article applies to the workplace in general including when the relation between employer and employee are governed by private law see heinisch cited above and the caselaw cited therein the court considers that the applicant conviction amounted to an interference within the meaning of article ii whether the interference wa prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim the court note that it is not in dispute that the interference wa prescribed by law and that it pursued a legitimate aim specifically the applicant wa convicted for having committed various offence provided for in the criminal code see paragraph above and the purpose of prosecuting and punishing these offence wa to prevent the disclosure of confidential information and to protect the reputation of his employer pw c it thus remains to be ascertained whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic society in particular whether there wa a proportionate relationship between the interference and the aim pursuediii whether the interference wa necessaryα characterisation of whistleblower at the outset and before analysing whether the interference wa necessary the court considers it useful to decide whether the applicant could be described a a whistleblower under the criterion established in it relevant caselaw in the various case that it ha examined in this area the court ha either explicitly framed the debate in term of the freedom of expression of whistleblower and concluded that the principle set out in the guja judgment were applicable see heinisch cited above or it ha ruled that the protection of whistleblower wa not in issue see for example rubins v latvia no january or aurelian oprea v romania no january in the present case the court of appeal explained that under luxembourg law the acceptance of whistleblowing a a defence derived from article of the convention had the effect of neutralising the illegal nature of the breach of the law it also specified that in such case it wa the statutory element of the offence which had to have been committed through the disclosure in good faith and in a proportionate and appropriate manner of information of general interest which wa thus neutralised leading to a defendant acquittal see paragraph above in the applicant case it had found that he could not rely on the defence of whistleblowing a defined in domestic law see paragraph above the court considers that it is not it task to express a view a to whether or not the statutory element of the offence of which the applicant wa accused should be neutralised a this is a matter for domestic law alone to that end it find that it is unnecessary to study the related argument submitted by the applicant and contested by the government see paragraph and above however it considers that in order to examine the complaint under article of the convention that ha been submitted to it it must ass whether this wa a whistleblowing case in which the principle established in that regard were applicable in this connection it point out firstly that there wa a hierarchical bond between the applicant and his employer pw c which entailed a duty of loyalty reserve and discretion on his part that duty wa a particular feature of the concept of whistleblowing see a contrario medžlis islamske zajednice brčko and others cited above secondly it point out that the applicant had contacted a journalist in order to disclose confidential information obtained in the context of his employment relationship taking the view that parallel can be drawn between the applicant action and those of the applicant in the abovecited case of guja and heinisch the court find that the applicant should be regarded in principle a a whistleblower for the purpose of the court caselaw in consequence it must review whether the various criterion established in the guja caselaw have been complied withβ compliance with the criterion established by the guja caselaw the court note that there is no dispute between the party with regard to the first four criterion established by the guja line of caselaw the only disagreement concern the fifth and sixth criterion a regard the fifth criterion a regard the fifth criterion the court note that the applicant right to protection of his freedom of expression is in conflict with the right of his employer pw c to protection of it reputation a the present application requires an examination of the fair balance that ha to be struck between these competing interest the court will have regard to the following factor firstly where the national authority have weighed up the interest at stake in compliance with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw strong reason are required if it is to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see von hannover v germany no gc no and echr a regard the assessment in the context of the balancing exercise between the respective interest of the harm sustained by the employer the court ha reiterated that there is an interest in protecting the commercial success and viability of company for the benefit of shareholder and employee but also for the wider economic good see heinisch cited above however with more particular regard to the reputation of a company the court ha also been careful to state that there is a difference between the reputation of an individual concerning social status which might have repercussion on his or her dignity and the commercial reputational interest of a company which are devoid of that moral dimension see uj v hungary no july in the present case the domestic court held that the fifth criterion of the guja caselaw wa not satisfied since the disclosure by the applicant of document that were subject to professional secrecy had caused harm to pw c resulting in particular from the damage to the firm reputation and the loss of client confidence in it internal security arrangement that outweighed the general interest see paragraph and above in balancing the interest at stake the court thus attributed greater weight to the harm suffered by pw c than to the interest of the disclosure made by the applicant the court must dismiss at the outset the applicant argument that the court of appeal merely pretended to weigh up the interest at stake see paragraph above in this connection it refers and subscribes to the exhaustive and convincing explanation provided by the government see paragraph above the court of appeal did indeed ass the nonpecuniary damage sustained by pw c before weighing up the respective interest however under domestic law the court of appeal could not award compensation in excess of the amount claimed by the civil party in fact it is common practice in luxembourg for individual or entity which have sustained nonpecuniary damage including substantial damage to waive the right to corresponding monetary compensation thus a civil party will frequently simply seek recognition of the damage sustained a such which entail requesting a symbolic award of one euro nonetheless the harm could not be regarded a nonexistent simply because pw c had assessed it at one euro previously the symbolic sum of one franc worth forty time le in consequence the court see no inherent contradiction in the fact that the court of appeal established on the one hand that damage had been sustained and on the other hand fixed the symbolic amount of that damage at one euro it is undeniable that pw c suffered harm owing to the very fact of the widely reported controversy arising out of the luxleaks case see mutatis mutandis heinisch cited above furthermore the press coverage confirms that the company experienced a difficult year after the situation came to light see paragraph in fine above however again according to the medium and this ha not been disputed once the initial difficult period had passed pw c saw an increase in turnover coupled with a significant increase in staff number see paragraph in fine above this is a fact that the court can not disregard in the context of the present case particularly in the light of distinction made by it in the abovecited uj judgment hence it must be ascertained whether the damage to the company reputation wa ultimately real and tangible however given the increase in it turnover at least once the first difficult year had passed pw c financial fortune do not appear to have suffered lasting harm and there is every indication that it reputation wa not definitively compromised at least not among the company that make up it client base the court concludes from this that while pw c undoubtedly suffered harm in the short term no longerterm damage to it reputation ha been established in order to continue it examination of how the respective interest were weighed up the court must now address the ground adduced by the domestic authority a regard the interest of the revelation made by the applicant in this connection the court of appeal reasoning which is central to the issue is a follows the document handed over by the applicant to the journalist did not contribute to the public debate on the luxembourg practice of tax rescript or trigger a debate on tax evasion or provide essential new and previously unknown information see paragraph above in reasoning in this way the court of appeal took account of a number of factor in particular it noted that that the applicant disclosure related solely to company tax return which did not enable any conclusion to be drawn a to the tax authority attitude towards those company it considered that there wa no compelling reason for the applicant to disclose the confidential document in question at a time when the practice of tax rescript had already been revealed by ad it specified that the document disclosed by the applicant which had been used to illustrate the premise that tax evasion wa being practiced by two group of multinational company were certainly useful to the journalist but did not provide any essential previously unknown information capable of relaunching or contributing to the debate on tax evasion see paragraph to above in taking that approach the court of appeal gave a detailed explanation for it reasoning a to the fifth criterion established by the guja caselaw accordingly the court would require strong reason to substitute it own view for that of the domestic court see von hannover no cited above however that situation did not apply in the present case for the following reason the court of appeal carefully assessed the interest of the applicant disclosure carrying out a thorough examination of their content and their repercussion for the issue of multinational company tax practice in this context it acknowledged that the disclosure were of general interest see paragraph above it even took into consideration the impact of the information accepting that it wa liable to concern and shock people see paragraph above nonetheless it held that the interest of the applicant disclosure weighed le heavily than the harm suffered by pw c after finding that those disclosure were of limited relevance in reaching that conclusion it noted that the document did not provide any information that wa essential new or previously unknown the court can not subscribe to the applicant view that in so doing the court of appeal added new criterion to those established by the court caselaw on the contrary it considers that the three qualifying criterion information that is essential new and previously unknown are absorbed in the court of appeal exhaustive reasoning on the fifth criterion concerning the balancing of the private and public interest at stake in the court opinion these term should be considered a clarification which in other circumstance might be considered too narrow but which in the present case served together with the other element taken into account by the court of appeal to found the conclusion that the applicant disclosure lacked sufficient interest to counterbalance the harm suffered by pw c the court considers that the court of appeal confined itself to examining the evidence carefully in the light of the criterion established by the court caselaw in this area before concluding that the document disclosed by the applicant were not of sufficient interest to justify acquitting him moreover the fact that in contrast ad wa acquitted in application of the same criterion in the court caselaw confirms that the national authority carried out a detailed examination in weighing up the respective interest a regard the sixth criterion in assessing the proportionality of an interference with freedom of expression the court ha held that the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are factor to be taken into account see otegi mondragon v spain no echr in the present case the court note that the domestic court took into consideration a a mitigating circumstance the disinterested nature of the applicant action and therefore imposed only a relatively modest fine see paragraph above the court concludes that such a penalty can reasonably be regarded a a relatively mild one which doe not have a genuinely chilling effect on the exercise of the applicant freedom or that of other employee but encourages those concerned to reflect on the legitimacy of the action being envisaged c conclusion regard being had to the contracting state margin of appreciation in this sphere the court concludes that the domestic court struck a fair balance in the present case between on the one hand the need to protect the right of the applicant employer and on the other the need to protect the applicant freedom of expression accordingly there ha been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the courtdeclares unanimously the complaint concerning article of the convention admissible hold by five vote to two that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in english and notified in writing on may pursuant to rule and of the rule of courtnature_p_ signature_p_ milan blaško paul lemmens registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the separate opinion of judge lemmens and pavli is annexed to this judgment plmb joint dissenting opinion of judge lemmens and pavli we regret that we can not agree with the majority finding that there ha been no violation of the applicant article right in this case our disagreement relates both to the general approach adopted by the majority in weighing the private employer right visàvis the public interest in the disclosure of the relevant material and to the reason provided by the national court in concluding that the employer interest ought to prevail under the circumstance in particular we are of the opinion that the consideration relied upon by the national court in their assessment of what is called the fifth criterion identified in guja v moldova gc no echr namely the criterion requiring a balancing of the public interest in obtaining the information and the harm caused by the disclosure to the employer see guja cited above and see also paragraph of the present judgment are at odds with basic notion of publicpolicy discourse in a democratic society regretfully therefore we are unable to agree with the majority acceptance of that reasoning see paragraph the outcome of the balancing exercise performed by the national court wa based on the supposedly limited contribution of the applicant disclosure to public debate a compared in particular with the initial set of revelation made by another employee of the company concerned the key argument in this respect wa that the document disclosed by the applicant did not bring to light any essential new and previously unknown information see paragraph of the present judgment based on that assessment the national court held that the harm suffered by the applicant employer outweighed the general interest in receiving the disclosed information ibid the nature of the applicant disclosure we recall that the applicant disclosure consisted of sixteen document including fourteen tax return by multinational corporation and two cover letter some of which were used to prepare an episode of the investigative television programme cash investigation broadcast on june see paragraph of the present judgment according to the investigative journalist in charge of that programme the applicant revelation served a the principal basis for that episode the journalist also noted that certain disclosure made during that episode would have been impossible without access to the information revealed by the applicant the document handed over by the applicant together with document obtained a part of the initial disclosure by a different whistleblower were subsequently published on and november by the international consortium of investigative journalist ibid it is clear from the case file that the applicant put forward compelling argument before the national court some of them mentioned in paragraph of the judgment a to why the tax return disclosed and in particular the annex thereto were important for verifying substantiating and building upon the document disclosed in the initial set of revelation these argument were also endorsed by the investigative journalist concerned who wa well placed to ass the importance of the applicant disclosure for the ongoing public debate on the matter the two set of disclosure appear therefore to have been closely connected it is not in dispute that the applicant disclosure wa in the public interest see paragraph of the present judgment the national court recognised that the disclosed material facilitated a public debate in luxembourg and indeed at the european level regarding the taxation of multinational company tax transparency the practice of socalled tax ruling and fair taxation in general see paragraph for the national court the decisive question wa how much wa it in the public interest a will be explained below we do not think that this is the correct way to pose the question under article see in particular paragraph below the weight to be attached to the interest of a private employer in whistleblower dispute it is settled caselaw that there is little scope under article of the convention for restriction on debate on question of public interest see sürek v turkey no gc no echr iv and guja cited above exception to the general principle established in article must be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly see hertel v switzerland august report vi steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii and guja cited above in determining the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression of an employee making a disclosure on publicinterest ground the court must under the socalled fifth guja criterion weigh the damage if any suffered by his or her employer a a result of the disclosure and ass whether such damage outweighed the interest of the public in having the information revealed see guja cited above in contrast to the present case the balancing exercise carried out in guja which involved disclosure made by a senior prosecutor wa between two public interest on the one hand the interest in informing the public about undue pressure and wrongdoing within a public prosecutor office and on the other the interest in maintaining public confidence in that body in heinisch v germany no echr extract which involved a publiclyowned healthcare provider the court recognised that the balancing exercise can also involve the private interest in protecting the commercial success and viability of company for the benefit of their shareholder and employee but also for the wider economic good conversely the court highlighted the public interest in running public company that meet proper service standard a an argument in favour of the disclosure the fifth guja criterion must be interpreted and applied in line with the overarching principle referred to in paragraph above a the court ha noted specifically in connection with the application of that criterion open discussion of topic of public concern is essential to democracy and regard must be had to the great importance of not discouraging member of the public from voicing their opinion on such matter see guja cited above in our view it follows from these consideration that once it is established a it ha been in the present case that the information disclosed by the employee wa a matter of public interest the disclosure in question must be presumed to be protected under article of the convention for this presumption to be rebutted under the fifth guja criterion the employer and in criminal proceeding the prosecution should be required to present compelling reason based on concrete and significant harm to the private interest concerned for establishing that these interest clearly outweighed the value of disclosure a le protective approach would result in considerable legal uncertainty and be likely to deter any future employee from making such disclosure which would be at odds with the fundamental principle guiding the application of the guja criterion furthermore the weighing of the competing interest under the fifth guja criterion should not be made in isolation but in the light of the global article analysis encompassing all the relevant criterion in other word the guja criterion are not to be viewed a mere box to be checked but a principle guiding a comprehensive review by the national court conversely this doe not mean that unmeritorious disclosure made with little concern for the public interest andor causing considerable harm to legitimate private interest should prevail the proposed approach is also supported by recent international development regarding the protection of whistleblower which have recognised the need for strengthened protection in both the public and private sphere see paragraph of the judgment notably eu directive on the protection of person who report breach of union law see paragraph of the judgment doe not make the protection of whistleblower conditional on any consideration related to the harm caused to the employer a long a the general condition for protection under article of the directive are met in the light of the above factor we consider that the court should have looked more closely at the manner in which the national court weighed up the competing interest at issue in the present case in particular the consideration stemming from the guja and heinisch line of caselaw have been applied in the present case the first whistleblower case to our knowledge to involve a purely private employer without due regard for the fundamental principle of article in particular the national decision were based on the isolated finding of a failure to meet the fifth criterion without assessing the role of that factor in the global analysis and without identifying any compelling private interest against a disclosure deemed to be generally in the public interest the requirement of essential new and previously unknown information finally and most importantly we take issue with the national court reliance within their assessment of the fifth guja criterion on the purported lack of essential new and previously unknown information in the applicant disclosure see paragraph above in our view such an approach doe not find support in this court caselaw see paragraph below rest on a misguided notion of how public debate work see paragraph below is likely to produce significant chilling effect see paragraph below and is questionable on the fact of the case see paragraph below the national court treatment of the applicant followup disclosure doe not sit well with the court general and one might add commonsensical view that the fact that a public debate on a certain matter is ongoing speaks in favour of further disclosure of information which develop that debate see for example dammann v switzerland no april and colaço mestre and sic sociedade independente de comunicação sa v portugal no and april furthermore the distinction made by the national court between the first and second set of revelation seems to rest on the notion that once a public debate is opened by certain information being disclosed the public interest in receiving information that confirms complement or reinforces the initial information is significantly reduced even if we were to accept the view that the fact disclosed by the current applicant were qualitatively le novel general tax avoidance by corporation rather than government malfeasance a such we find it hard to come to term with a view of public debate that is instantaneous or frozen in time the public attitude towards issue of public interest can change constantly in some case decade of argument and counterargument may be needed before any meaningful change in public or private conduct is achieved in addition with regard to the subjectmatter of the revelation made by the applicant in the present case the intricacy of corporate tax policy are hardly the most accessible topic for the general public the national court appear to have underestimated the great illustrative strength that lie in disclosure of the kind made by the applicant yes the general contour of a perceived problem may be widely known but there is still great value in sketching out it precise dimension and manifestation one may be well aware for example of the problem of police violence but the impact of a specific episode of excessive force captured on video can nevertheless be transformational the approach taken by the national court and endorsed by the majority is capable of creating significant chilling effect for future whistleblower disclosure in the private sector this is because an individual who is considering disclosing information that he or she belief to be in the public interest may face great uncertainty in assessing whether that information will be deemed to meet the much higher standard of essential new and previously unknown data in this respect it is generally recognised that the scope of protected disclosure should be easily understandable by potential whistleblower and that the protection of whistleblower should not be subject to subjective and unpredictable condition without any clear and precise indication of what is expected of the potential whistleblower the approach taken by the national court is at odds with these requirement finally the harm caused to the employer interest in the present case wa negligible in the long term a expressly recognised by the majority see paragraph of the judgment a such the applicant disclosure must have been considered of such low article value that they had to give way even to le than significant harm on the other side of the scale while we appreciate the need for some deterrence against potentially unjustified and repeated disclosure about the luxembourg financial market we find that the factual assessment made by the national court in this case is far from convincing see paragraph above in conclusion the balance struck by the majority between the public interest in whistleblower disclosure and the privatesector interest in secrecy is in tension with the guja line of this court caselaw a well a with emerging european standard in this area in our humble view it creates obstacle to effective protection for whistleblowing in the private sector see httpslequotidienlupolitiquesocieteprocesluxleaksperrinlesvoleursnontpasetecondamnes ibid report

october when she wa in the office of her partner an mep and first deputy to the mayor of nîmes she explained that their relationship wa public knowledge and that the racist comment on the applicant publicly accessible facebook page included one associating her north africansounding forename with that of her partner and his policy she stated that after she had discovered the post she had

but he had confirmed he wa talking about her when he said thanks f and kiss to l she added that she had then been accompanied to the town hall by the prefect wife who wa just passing by and who had seen how annoyed she wa on the way there she had logged onto facebook again to find that sb comment had already been removed the investigation into the applicant facebook account revealed on the same day that the comment by lr were still there while those posted by sb had indeed disappeared for his part lr wa identified a being an employee of nîmes town council when interviewed by the gendarme on january he explained that he worked a an assistant in the applicant election campaign and denied that his comment had been racist or an incitement to racial hatred explaining that he had never intended to direct his comment against lt he explained that in the meantime he had deleted the comment in which fp could have recognised himself or have been recognised by others during his interview of january sb told the gendarme that he had been unaware that the applicant facebook page wa publicly accessible and had deleted his comment immediately after lt had come to see him at his hairdressing salon he added that he had informed the applicant later that day of his altercation with lt on january the applicant wa also interviewed by the investigator recalling that he had been a candidate in nîmes standing against fp lts partner he explained that he had been unable to monitor the large number of comment posted each week on the wall of his facebook account he indicated in particular that he had not written the impugned comment himself he had not had the time to delete the comment by sb who had already done so he had only become aware of lr comment when he wa summoned to the gendarmerie and he wa prepared to delete them if the court so requested he consulted his facebook wall every day but did not often read the comment which were too numerous given that he had more than friend who could post comment hour a day and that he preferred to post content to inform his reader lt whom he knew only by her partner surname had not been mentioned by name and he had not been aware of her forename until she filed a complaint lt had once personally taken him to task at a polling station she should have telephoned him to ask him to delete these comment which would have obviated the need for a criminal complaint but her aim had clearly been to destabilise his candidature a he wa standing against her partner instead lt had gone to the hairdressing salon of sb whom she knew to insult and threaten him in front of witness lastly he knew lr and sb activist in his party who did not hold any office in it referring to his foreign origin he added that he had never displayed any racism or discrimination against anyone and that he did not perceive any call to murder or violence in the disputed remark which he considered to be within the limit of any citizen freedom of expression he emphasised that he had removed public access to his facebook wall a few day before this interview in order to limit access only to those who chose to be his friend and to avoid any further incident that were not of his making after the interview the investigator were able to confirm that the applicant facebook page wa indeed no longer accessible to the public the applicant together with sb and lr were summoned to appear before nîmes criminal court in connection with the publication of the comment in question on the wall of his facebook account to answer charge of incitement to hatred or violence against a group and in particular lt on account of their origin or the fact of belonging or not belonging to a specific ethnicity nation race or religion the summons referred to section first paragraph section eighth paragraph and section of the law of july and section of law no of july in a judgment of february the nîmes criminal court found the applicant sb and lr guilty a charged and ordered each of them to pay a fine of euro eur the applicant wa convicted under section first paragraph and section eighth paragraph of the law of july and section of law no of july sb and the applicant were also ordered jointly to pay eur to lt a civil party in compensation for nonpecuniary damage however the court did not see fit to order the sanction of electoral disqualification that had been called for by the public prosecutor in it judgment the court began by finding that the various offending comment had specifically defined the group concerned namely muslim to equate that group with drug dealer and prostitute who reign supreme riff raff who sell drug all day long or those responsible for throwing stone at car belonging to white people wa clearly likely on account of both the meaning and scope of the comment to arouse a strong feeling of rejection or hostility towards people who belonged or were assumed to belong to the muslim community it further took the view that lt could be regarded a having been provoked by the impugned comment in view of the reference to her partner and the wording thanks f and kiss to l which had had the effect of portraying them both a being responsible for the alleged transformation of nîmes into algiers and to arouse hatred or violence against them a regard the applicant the court observed that it could be inferred from section of the law of july a interpreted by the constitutional council in it decision of september that the criminal liability of the producer of a website intended for communication to the general public including access to message posted by it user would only be engaged in respect of such message if it could be established that the producer had been aware of their content before they were posted or if not if he or she failed to act promptly to delete the message at issue upon becoming aware of them it dismissed the applicant argument according to which he had not had time to read the comment and that he had not been aware of the comment by sb and lr on the ground that first comment could only be posted on his wall after he had given access to his friend of which there were at october and that he wa responsible for checking the content of the post second he must have been aware that his page wa likely to attract comment with a political and thus essential polemical content and that he should have been all the more careful to monitor them the court concluded that having set up an electronic public communication service on his own initiative for the purpose of exchanging opinion and having left the offending comment which had remained visible a of december according to the investigator the applicant had failed to act promptly to put an end to their dissemination and wa therefore guilty in his capacity a principal the applicant and sb appealed sb subsequently withdrew his appeal in a judgment of october the nîmes court of appeal upheld the applicant conviction reducing the fine to eur it further ordered him to pay lt eur in cost for the appeal proceeding in it reasoning the court of appeal held that the criminal court had been correct in finding that the comment clearly defined the group of people concerned namely muslim and that to associate the muslim community with crime and insecurity in the city of nîmes wa likely to arouse a strong feeling of rejection or hostility towards that group noting that the legislation cited in the proceeding concerned discrimination against a person or group of person it found a follows the expression kiss to leila referring to lt and her connection with fp deputy mayor of nîmes who is described in the post a having contributed to the abandonment of the town of nîmes to the muslim and thus to insecurity is such a to associate her with the transformation of the town and thus to arouse hatred or violence against her on the basis of these element the two post in question constitute incitement to hatred or violence against a person namely fps partner lt on account of a presumption because of her forename that she belonged to a muslim community referring further to the provision of section of the law of july and to the fact of the case the court of appeal noted that there wa no evidence that the applicant had been informed of the content of the comment before they were posted but that in his capacity a an elected member of the front national and a public figure he had knowingly made his facebook wall public and had therefore authorised his friend to post comment on it the court continued it reasoning a follows by thus acting voluntarily he became responsible for the content of the comment posted his status a a political figure required him to be all the more vigilant he can not claim not to have been aware of the comment posted on his website on october especially a he stated during the investigation that he consulted it every day he did not however remove the comment which were subsequently deleted by s b himself alerted by the latter to the reaction of the civil party he did not delete lr comment either and the latter wa still present on his website when consulted by the investigator on december he can not be regarded a the court below rightly found a having promptly put an end to the dissemination of the offending comment he legitimised his position by explaining that such comment appeared to him to be compatible with freedom of expression the fact they were left on his wall wa thus deliberate on his part in the light of these element the court below wa right to find the defendant guilty a charged and the judgment is upheld in respect of his conviction the applicant appealed to the court of cassation relying in particular on article of the convention in a single ground of appeal he argued that for the offence to be made out the comment had to contain encouragement or incitement to discrimination hatred or violence and not merely give rise to a strong feeling of rejection or hostility towards a group or person that the mere fear of a risk of racism could not deprive citizen of the freedom to express their view on the consequence of immigration in certain town or neighbourhood the comment having specifically deplored the transformation of the town of nîmes by immigrant of north african origin and of the muslim faith that the summons to appear before the court had been unlawful and lastly that the impugned remark had in no way been directed at lt personally and had been distorted by the court of appeal in a judgment of march the court of cassation dismissed his appeal in particular with regard to article of the convention stating a follows first the offence of incitement is established where a in the present case the court find that by both their meaning and their scope the impugned text may arouse a feeling of rejection or hostility hatred or violence towards a group or an individual on account of a particular religion second since the abovementioned text fall within the restriction provided for in paragraph of article of the european convention on human right the principle of freedom of expression enshrined in paragraph of that article can not be relied upon relevant legal frameworkdomestic law law of july the relevant provision in force at the material time read a follows section anyone who by uttering speech cry or threat in a public place or assembly or by mean of a written or printed text drawing engraving painting emblem image or any other written spoken or pictorial item sold or distributed offered for sale or exhibited in a public place or assembly or by mean of a placard or notice exhibited in a place where it can be seen by the public or by any electronic mean of communication to the public ha directly incited the perpetrator or perpetrator to commit a serious crime or major offence crime or délit and if the incitement ha been acted upon

dc of june declaring numerous provision to be unconstitutional created an online hate observatory it mission is to monitor and analyse development in this area by involving operator in particular of social network such a facebook association authority and researcher concerned with the combat against and prevention of such act working group have been tasked with reflecting on the concept of hateful content improving knowledge of this phenomenon analysing the mechanism of dissemination and the mean of combating it and lastly ensuring prevention education and support for internet user the said law also led to the creation of a national unit for combating online hate within the paris tribunal judiciaire which started operating in january it exercise jurisdiction based on the complexity of the procedure or the extent of the breach of public order which may stem in particular from the high medium profile or particular sensitivity of a given case circular of november on the combat against online hate crim e international instrument internet communication the relevant text adopted by the council of europe committee of minister and the united nation can be found in paragraph to of the judgment in delfi a v estonia gc no echr hate speech united nationsa human right council in his report submitted in accordance with human right council resolution a september the special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression mr frank la rue made the following observation while some of the above concept may overlap the special rapporteur considers the following element to be essential when determining whether an expression constitutes incitement to hatred real and imminent danger of violence resulting from the expression intent of the speaker to incite discrimination hostility or violence and careful consideration by the judiciary of the context in which hatred wa expressed given that international law prohibits some form of speech for their consequence and not for their content a such because what is deeply offensive in one community may not be so in another accordingly any contextual assessment must include consideration of various factor including the existence of pattern of tension between religious or racial community discrimination against the targeted group the tone and content of the speech the person inciting hatred and the mean of disseminating the expression of hate for example a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of facebook user doe not carry the same weight a a statement published on a mainstream website similarly artistic expression should be considered with reference to it artistic value and context given that art may be used to provoke strong feeling without the intention of inciting violence discrimination or hostility moreover while state are required to prohibit by law any advocacy of national racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence under article of the covenant there is no requirement to criminalize such expression the special rapporteur underscore that only serious and extreme instance of incitement to hatred which would cross the sevenpart threshold should be criminalized in other case the special rapporteur is of the view that state should adopt civil law with the application of diverse remedy including procedural remedy for example access to justice and ensuring effectiveness of domestic institution and substantive remedy for example reparation that are adequate prompt and proportionate to the gravity of the expression which may include restoring reputation preventing recurrence and providing financial compensation in addition while some type of expression may raise concern in term of tolerance civility and respect for others there are instance in which neither criminal nor civil sanction are justified the special rapporteur wish to reiterate that the right to freedom of expression includes form of expression that are offensive disturbing and shocking indeed since not all type of inflammatory hateful or offensive speech amount to incitement the two should not be conflatedb committee on the elimination of racial discrimination general recommendation no of september on combating racist hate speech provides guideline on the requirement of the international convention on the elimination of all form of racial discrimination the aim being to help the state party to fulfil their obligation it is indicated in particular a follows racist hate speech addressed in committee practice ha included all the specific speech form referred to in article directed against group recognized in article of the convention which forbids discrimination on ground of race colour descent or national or ethnic origin such a indigenous people descentbased group and immigrant or noncitizen including migrant domestic worker refugee and asylum seeker a well a speech directed against woman member of these and other vulnerable group in the light of the principle of intersectionality and bearing in mind that criticism of religious leader or commentary on religious doctrine or tenet of faith should not be prohibited or punished the committee attention ha also been engaged by hate speech targeting person belonging to certain ethnic group who profess or practice a religion different from the majority including expression of islamophobia anti semitism and other similar manifestation of hatred against ethnoreligious group a well a extreme manifestation of hatred such a incitement to genocide and to terrorism stereotyping and stigmatization of member of protected group ha also been the subject of expression of concern and recommendation adopted by the committee racist hate speech can take many form and is not confined to explicitly racial remark a is the case with discrimination under article speech attacking particular racial or ethnic group may employ indirect language in order to disguise it target and objective in line with their obligation under the convention state party should give due attention to all manifestation of racist hate speech and take effective measure to combat them the principle articulated in the present recommendation apply to racist hate speech whether emanating from individual or group in whatever form it manifest itself orally or in print or disseminated through electronic medium including the internet and social networking site a well a nonverbal form of expression such a the display of racist symbol image and behaviour at public gathering including sporting event on the qualification of dissemination and incitement a offence punishable by law the committee considers that the following contextual factor should be taken into account the content and form of speech whether the speech is provocative and direct in what form it is constructed and disseminated and the style in which it is delivered the economic social and political climate prevalent at the time the speech wa made and disseminated including the existence of pattern of discrimination against ethnic and other group including indigenous people discourse which in one context are innocuous or neutral may take on a dangerous significance in another in it indicator on genocide the committee emphasized the relevance of locality in appraising the meaning and potential effect of racist hate speech the position or status of the speaker in society and the audience to which the speech is directed the committee consistently draw attention to the role of politician and other public opinionformers in contributing to the creation of a negative climate towards group protected by the convention and ha encouraged such person and body to adopt positive approach directed to the promotion of intercultural understanding and harmony the committee is aware of the special importance of freedom of speech in political matter and also that it exercise carry with it special duty and responsibility the reach of the speech including the nature of the audience and the mean of transmission whether the speech wa disseminated through mainstream medium or the internet and the frequency and extent of the communication in particular when repetition suggests the existence of a deliberate strategy to engender hostility towards ethnic and racial group the objective of the speech speech protecting or defending the human right of individual and group should not be subject to criminal or other sanction informed ethical and objective medium including social medium and the internet have an essential role in promoting responsibility in the dissemination of idea and opinion in addition to putting in place appropriate legislation for the medium in line with international standard state party should encourage the public and private medium to adopt code of professional ethic and press code that incorporate respect for the principle of the convention and other fundamental human right standard the council of europea the committee of minister the annex to recommendation no r of the council of europe committee of minister on hate speech adopted on october provides in particular a follows scope the principle set out hereafter apply to hate speech in particular hate speech disseminated through the medium for the purpose of the application of these principle the term hate speech shall be understood a covering all form of expression which spread incite promote or justify racial hatred xenophobia anti semitism or other form of hatred based on intolerance including intolerance expressed by aggressive nationalism and ethnocentrism discrimination and hostility against minority migrant and people of immigrant origin principle the government of the member state public authority and public institution at the national regional and local level a well a official have a special responsibility to refrain from statement in particular to the medium which may reasonably be understood a hate speech or a speech likely to produce the effect of legitimising spreading or promoting racial hatred xenophobia anti semitism or other form of discrimination or hatred based on intolerance such statement should be prohibited and publicly disavowed whenever they occur principle national law and practice should allow the court to bear in mind that specific instance of hate speech may be so insulting to individual or group a not to enjoy the level of protection afforded by article of the european convention on human right to other form of expression this is the case where hate speech is aimed at the destruction of the right and freedom laid down in the convention or at their limitation to a greater extent than provided therein principle national law and practice should allow the competent prosecution authority to give special attention a far a their discretion permit to case involving hate speech in this regard these authority should in particular give careful consideration to the suspect right to freedom of expression given that the imposition of criminal sanction generally constitutes a serious interference with that freedom the competent court should when imposing criminal sanction on person convicted of hate speech offence ensure strict respect for the principle of proportionality principle national law and practice in the area of hate speech should take due account of the role of the medium in communicating information and idea which expose analyse and explain specific instance of hate speech and the underlying phenomenon in general a well a the right of the public to receive such information and idea to this end national law and practice should distinguish clearly between the responsibility of the author of expression of hate speech on the one hand and any responsibility of the medium and medium professional contributing to their dissemination a part of their mission to communicate information and idea on matter of public interest on the other handb european commission against racism and intolerance ecri the relevant passage of ecris general policy recommendation no on combating hate speech adopted on december read a follows the european commission against racism and intolerance ecritaking note of the differing way in which hate speech ha been defined and is understood at the national and international level a well a of the different form that it can take considering that hate speech is to be understood for the purpose of the present general policy recommendation a the advocacy promotion or incitement in any form of the denigration hatred or vilification of a person or group of person a well a any harassment insult negative stereotyping stigmatization or threat in respect of such a person or group of person and the justification of all the preceding type of expression on the ground of race colour descent national or ethnic origin age disability language religion or belief sex gender gender identity sexual orientation and other personal characteristic or status recognising also that form of expression that offend shock or disturb will not on that account alone amount to hate speech and that action against the use of hate speech should serve to protect individual and group of person rather than particular belief ideology or religion recognising that the use of hate speech can reflect or promote the unjustified assumption that the user is in some way superior to a person or a group of person that is or are targeted by it recognising that the use of hate speech may be intended to incite or reasonably expected to have the effect of inciting others to commit act of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those who are targeted by it and that this is an especially serious form of such speech recognising that the use of hate speech appears to be increasing especially through electronic form of communication which magnify it impact but that it exact extent remains unclear because of the lack of systematic reporting and collection of data on it occurrence and that this need to be remedied particularly through the provision of appropriate support for those targeted or affected by it aware that ignorance and insufficient medium literacy a well a alienation discrimination indoctrination and marginalisation can be exploited to encourage the use of hate speech without the real character and consequence of such speech being fully appreciated stressing the importance of education in undermining the misconception and misinformation that form the basis of hate speech and of the need for such education to be directed in particular to the young recognising that an important mean of tackling hate speech is through confronting and condemning it directly by counterspeech that clearly show it destructive and unacceptable character recognising that politician religious and community leader and others in public life have a particularly important responsibility in this regard because of their capacity to exercise influence over a wide audience conscious of the particular contribution that all form of medium whether online or offline can play both in disseminating and combating hate speech recommends that the government of member state take appropriate and effective action against the use in a public context of hate speech which is intended or can reasonably be expected to incite act of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those targeted by it through the use of the criminal law provided that no other le restrictive measure would be effective and the right to freedom of expression and opinion is respected and accordinglya ensure that the offence are clearly defined and take due account of the need for a criminal sanction to be appliedb ensure that the scope of these offence is defined in a manner that permit their application to keep pace with technological developmentsc ensure that prosecution for these offence are brought on a nondiscriminatory basis and are not used in order to suppress criticism of official policy political opposition or religious beliefsd ensure the effective participation of those targeted by hate speech in the relevant proceedingse provide penalty for these offence that take account both of the serious consequence of hate speech and the need for a proportionate responsef monitor the effectiveness of the investigation of complaint and the prosecution of offender with a view to enhancing both of these in it explanatory memorandum ecri provides the following clarification the recommendation further recognises that in some instance a particular feature of the use of hate speech is that it may be intended to incite or can reasonably be expected to have the effect of inciting others to commit act of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those targeted by it a the definition above make clear the element of incitement entail there being either a clear intention to bring about the commission of act of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination or an imminent risk of such act occurring a a consequence of the particular hate speech used intent to incite might be established where there is an unambiguous call by the person using hate speech for others to commit the relevant act or it might be inferred from the strength of the language used and other relevant circumstance such a the previous conduct of the speaker however the existence of intent may not always be easy to demonstrate particularly where remark are ostensibly concerned with supposed fact or coded language is being used european union law and

point hate speech in the latest version of community standard the lawalleged violation of article of the convention the applicant argued that his criminal conviction on account of comment posted by third party on the wall of his facebook account had breached article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary admissibility noting that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded and is not inadmissible on any other ground within the meaning of article of the convention the court declares it admissible merit the party submissionsa the applicant the applicant submitted by way of preliminary argument that the domestic court had extrapolated from the expression kiss to l that it wa directed against the partner of the deputy mayor of nîmes and they had relied upon it in convicting him for incitement to racial hatred and discrimination whereas lt had not been the subject of or identifiable in sb comment he also stressed that he had not been aware at the time of their publication of the comment that had been posted on the wall of his facebook account he pointed out that sb had deleted his comment after his discussion with lt on the same day and argued that he could not therefore be criticised for failing to react promptly to a publication that had materially existed for le than twentyfour hour and in respect of which lt had not sent him any notice to delete even though his contact detail in his capacity a a local councillor were in the public domain the applicant stated that he wa not a close friend of the couple the deputy mayor of nîmes and his partner that he knew neither the surname nor the forename of the partner and that she wa not a public figure lastly he noted that after the comment containing the expression kiss to l had immediately been removed by their author sb only the comment posted by lr remained and the latter had made no reference to lt the applicant concluded that his conviction had been decided in breach of the requirement of foreseeability of the law since he had not been able to anticipate it application to the circumstance of the case the applicant further submitted that the court caselaw attached the utmost importance to the protection of freedom of expression in the context of political controversy especially during an election period lr had therefore been legitimately entitled to post his unseemly comment about the deterioration of the town of nîmes during the term of office of the outgoing mayor he also submitted that in their caselaw prior to the event the domestic court had required much harsher language which had to contain an incitement or an encouragement to commit an act the applicant also saw in this a failure to ensure foreseeability and legal certainty by analogy with the caselaw concerning the lack of liability of journalist who merely disseminated statement made by third party referring to magyar tartalomszolgáltatók egyesülete and indexhu zrt v hungary no february the applicant submitted that his conviction in his capacity merely a publisher or producer did not appear to be a necessary and proportionate restriction of his freedom to impart information given that the author of the impugned statement had been identified and punished he also criticised the court for not taking into account the fact that at no time had the person who considered herself the target of the comment asked him to delete them in his view this would entail a strict liability potentially requiring him to close the commenting space altogether and thus entailing a chilling effect on freedom of expression lastly the applicant contended that by requiring him to ensure particular vigilance on account of the fact that his facebook profile wa likely to attract comment of a political nature that were in essence polemical the court had placed a special burden of liability upon himb the government the government began by stating that the criminal offence provided for in the freedom of the press act of july where they were committed not by the written press but by an audiovisual or online mean of communication were subject in view of the specific nature of such medium to a special system of criminal liability governed by section and of law no of july they added that facebook page fell within the category of online communication to the public which wa itself included in the broader category of electronic mean of public communication they emphasised that according to the court of cassation and the constitutional council the producer wa the person who took the initiative of creating an online public communication service for the exchange of opinion on predefined theme the government acknowledged that there had been no other caselaw concerning the criminal liability of an individual who owned a facebook wall on account of comment posted there by third party they noted however that the court of cassation had previously held that the use of the internet wa covered by the phrase any electronic mean of communication to the public while developing caselaw on the concept of publicity which wa established when the addressee were not linked to each other by a community of interest and the offending remark were disseminated via a website accessible to the public see paragraph above they further referred to two case in which the court of cassation had handed down judgment relating to the criminal liability of private individual producer of an online public communication site enabling message from internet user to be accessed by the public under section of law no of july on audiovisual communication one concerned the agent of a chain of shop creator of a discussion forum on the internet aimed at allowing nonsalaried manager of the chain shop to express their view who had been sued for defamation on account of comment posted on the forum court of cassation criminal division january appeal no the second concerned the chair of an association for the defence of local resident of a municipality on account of comment posted by internet user on the personal contribution page of the association website court of cassation criminal division october appeal no the government did not deny that the applicant conviction constituted an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of expression and in particular with his right to impart information however they took the view that this interference wa prescribed by law pursued a legitimate aim and wa necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention they first pointed out that the court had previously held that a conviction under section of the act of july wa prescribed by law within the meaning of article of the convention soulas and others v france no july a to whether the offence could be imputed to the applicant they noted that the concept of producer of an online communication site the definition of which had not changed since the court of cassations judgment of december had been perfectly foreseeable and accessible to the applicant a fact which the latter had not disputed they took the view that the applicant wa merely challenging the domestic court in concreto assessment of the constituent element of the offence the government added that the applicant analysis of the ground for his conviction wa incorrect in actual fact the domestic court had noted his status a a politician in order to characterise him a a producer establishing that he had deliberately chosen to set up an online communication site and they had convicted him on the ground that he had not promptly deleted the hateful comment his status a a politician had been noted among other evidence and fact including his own statement about his daily consultation of the site the fact that he could not have been unaware of the comment or the fact that he had been informed of the civil party anger a to the legitimate aim the government stressed that section of the act of july punished conduct which induced a feeling of hostility rejection or hatred towards member of a community the interference had sought to ensure the protection of the reputation or right of others this being one of the legitimate aim enumerated in the second paragraph of article a to the necessity of the interference the government noted that the issue wa a novel one while acknowledging that similar subject had been analysed in the court caselaw they submitted that in view of the context of the case and the nature of the remark made the state had enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation while this margin wa narrower in the case of remark made by a politician in a political or generalinterest debate this wa not the case where they actually constituted hate speech they noted that the applicant had not been convicted for posting on his facebook wall comment expressing a mere political opinion on change in the town of nîmes but comment that had incited hatred towards the muslim community in general and lt in particular in their view the aim and effect of the impugned remark had been to arouse a strong feeling of rejection and hatred towards those target whilst the applicant had maintained that they remained within the limit of freedom of expression since they contained no call to murder or violence in the government submission the test for hate speech wa not whether or not it called for murder but whether it aroused significant feeling of rejection and hatred the impugned statement therefore fell within the scope of hate speech in respect of which state had a broader margin of appreciation in view of the serious consequence that such speech could have the government further argued that a a politician the applicant had special duty and responsibility in relation to hate speech thus affecting the margin of appreciation to be afforded to the state a to the existence of sufficient and relevant ground the government first noted the electoral context and consequently the fact that the facebook wall wa likely to receive numerous hit lr comment had been left there even though the applicant had issued a statement urging commentator to be careful thus showing that he had read the post on the wall of his facebook account therefore the retention of lr comment together with the warning given could have led the reader to believe that the applicant had not regarded it a problematic and that he wa associating himself with it his conviction had therefore been in keeping with the need to combat hate speech effectively during election campaign with regard to the status of the person targeted by the impugned comment they pointed out that lt wa well known but without being a public figure she could therefore legitimately expect not to be associated like the muslim community with the alleged insecurity in the town of nîmes the government further submitted that the national court in wellreasoned decision had found that the remark in question amounted to incitement to hatred they had convicted the applicant because he had deliberately left a hateful comment on the wall of his facebook account despite being aware of it existence the applicant had chosen to allow comment to be posted on his wall and to make it publicly accessible the government pointed out that contrary to the applicant submission the caselaw prior to the relevant event had not required much harsher language containing an incitement or encouragement to commit an act on the contrary according to the court of cassation trial court had to find that the impugned remark may incite the public to discrimination hatred or violence against a specific person or group incitement already being defined a any remark capable of inciting the public to discrimination hatred or violence against a specific person or group the government submitted lastly that the severity of the penalty wa proportionate to the offence committed the court assessment the court note that it is not in dispute between the party that the applicant criminal conviction constituted an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of expression a guaranteed by article of the convention such interference will infringe article unless it wa prescribed by law pursued one or more of the legitimate aim referred to in paragraph and wa necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve the aim or aim in questiona prescribed by law the applicant began by complaining about the lack of foreseeability of his criminal conviction alleging a breach of the principle of legal certainty the court however agrees with the government observation that the applicant merely called into question the in concreto assessment by the domestic court of the element of the offence see paragraph above it thus note that the applicant who did not raise any argument to dispute the point that the interference wa prescribed by law within the meaning of article of the convention in the context of his appeal on point of law see paragraph above wa in fact complaining about the assessment by the domestic court in the circumstance of the case see paragraph et seq above this being relevant to an examination of the necessity of the interference and not to whether the interference wa prescribed by law moreover the court note that the applicant criminal conviction wa handed down mainly on the basis of section first paragraph section eighth paragraph of the law of july and section of law no of july see paragraph and above it observes that it ha previously found that a criminal conviction under section and of the law of july meet the requirement of foreseeability of the law within the meaning of article of the convention see among other authority garaudy v france dec no june soulas and others v france no july and le pen v france dec no april it doe not see any reason to depart from that finding in the present case the court also note that the applicant wa prosecuted a principal in his capacity a producer within the meaning of section of law no of july in line both with the constitutional council decision of september and the court of cassations caselaw prior to the applicant conviction concerning the concept of producer see paragraph above admittedly it find that the responsibility of a facebook account holder on account of remark posted on the wall had not previously given rise to any specific caselaw the court would point out however that the novel character particularly in the light of caselaw of the legal question thus raised doe not constitute in itself a breach of the requirement of accessibility and foreseeability of the law in so far a the solution adopted wa one of the possible and reasonably foreseeable interpretation see mutatis mutandis soros v france no october huhtamäki v finland no march and x and y v france no september in addition and above all the applicant ha not called into question this legal basis in term of the requirement of article not having raised such an objection in the context of his appeal on point of law either see paragraph above the court doe not therefore find it necessary to address this aspect of the foreseeability of the law in those circumstance the court doe not see any reason to find that the interference wa not prescribed by law within the meaning of the second paragraph of article of the conventionb legitimate aim the court find that the measure pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or right of others see soulas cited above le pen cited above and delfi a v estonia gc no echr c whether the interference wa necessary in a democratic societyi general principle the court would refer to the general principle for assessing the necessity of an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression those principle having been frequently reaffirmed by the court since the handyside v the united kingdom judgment december series a no and restated more recently in morice v france gc no echr delfi a cited above and perinçek v switzerland gc no echr extract with the caselaw reference therein the court thus reiterates that freedom of expression is one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to article it applies not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society the adjective necessary in article implies the existence of a pressing social need in general the need for an interference with the exercise of the freedom of expression must be convincingly established admittedly it is primarily for the national authority to ass whether there is such a need capable of justifying that interference and to that end they enjoy a certain margin of appreciation however the margin of appreciation go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the law and the decision that apply it in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction the court must examine the interference in the light of the case a a whole including the content of the impugned statement and the context in which they were made in particular it must determine whether the interference in issue wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it were relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that these authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and that moreover they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant factsii application to the present case the court observes that the domestic court found the applicant guilty of the offence of inciting hatred or violence against a group in general and the individual lt in particular on account of their origin or the fact of belonging or not belonging to a given ethnicity nation race or religion the nîmes criminal court relying on the provision of section of the law of july a interpreted by the constitutional council in it decision of september found that the applicant by taking the initiative of creating an electronic public communication service for the exchange opinion and by allowing lr comment to remain visible almost six week after they had been posted the applicant had not promptly put an end to this dissemination and wa therefore guilty in his capacity a principal see paragraph above subsequently the nîmes court of appeal while upholding the firstinstance judgment noted for it part that there wa no evidence that the applicant had been informed of the content of the comment before they were posted but that in his capacity a an elected representative and public figure which required him to be particularly vigilant he had knowingly made the wall of his facebook account public and had thus authorised his friend to post comment on it thereby becoming liable for the content of any such post it also found that the applicant had not promptly stopped the dissemination of the impugned comment while noting that he had further justified his position by claiming that such comment were compatible with freedom of expression and that he had deliberately left them on his facebook wall see paragraph above in the light of the reasoning of the domestic court the court must in accordance with it settled caselaw examine whether their finding of liability on the part of the applicant wa based on relevant and sufficient ground in the particular circumstance of the case see in relation to a major internet news portal delfi a cited above in doing so and in assessing the proportionality of the impugned penalty it will consider the context of the comment the step taken by the applicant to remove the comment once posted the possibility of holding the author liable instead of the applicant and lastly the consequence of the domestic proceeding for the applicant see inter alia delfi a cited above and jezior v poland committee no june α context of impugned comment nature of impugned comment the court note at the outset that the comment posted on the wall of the applicant facebook account were clearly unlawful in nature see mutatis mutandis delfi a cited above both the criminal court in it judgment of february see paragraph above and the nîmes court of appeal in it judgment of october see paragraph above established in reasoned decision that first the impugned remark clearly defined the group concerned namely muslim and that to equate the muslim community with delinquency and insecurity in the city of nîmes by associating this group with drug dealer and prostitute who reign supreme riffraff who sell drug all day long or those who throw stone at car belonging to white people sought in meaning and scope to arouse a strong feeling of rejection and hostility towards the group of people who were known or presumed to be muslim on the other hand the expression kiss to l referring to lt who wa associated with fp a deputy mayor of the town of nîmes portrayed in the comment a having contributed to the abandonment of the town to muslim and thus to insecurity wa such a to associate her because she wa presumed on account of her forename to belong the muslim community with the alleged transformation of the town and thus to arouse hatred and violence against her personally the applicant indeed claimed that lt had not been the subject of sb comment and had not been identifiable see paragraph above and that lr remark made in an electoral context had not exceeded the limit of the right to freedom of expression see paragraph and above on this point the court reiterates that it role is limited to ascertaining whether the interference at issue in the present case can be regarded a necessary in a democratic society and that contracting state enjoy under article a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the need for and extent of an interference in the freedom of expression protected by that article see mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no echr extract this margin is defined by the type of expression in question in this connection there is little scope under article of the convention for restriction on political expression or on debate on question of public interest see perinçek cited above a regard the electoral context relied upon by the applicant the court would emphasise that the promotion of free political debate is a very important feature of a democratic society it attache the highest importance to freedom of expression in the context of political debate and considers that very strong reason are required to justify restriction on political speech allowing broad restriction on political speech in individual case would undoubtedly affect respect for the freedom of expression in general in the state concerned see feldek v slovakia no echr viii and féret v belgium no july however the freedom of political debate is undoubtedly not absolute in nature a contracting state may make it subject to certain restriction or penalty but it is for the court to give a final ruling on the compatibility of such measure with the freedom of expression enshrined in article see castells v spain april series a no and féret cited above the court thus reiterates that tolerance and respect for the equal dignity of all human being are the cornerstone of a democratic and pluralistic society it follows that in principle it may be considered necessary in democratic society to penalise or even prevent all form of expression that propagate encourage promote or justify hatred based on intolerance including religious intolerance provided that any formality condition restriction or penalty imposed are proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued see féret cited above the court also attache particular importance to the medium used and the context in which the offending remark were disseminated and therefore to their potential impact on public order and social cohesion ibid the present case concerned the wall of a facebook account which wa freely accessible to the public and used in the context of an election campaign representing a form of expression which wa aimed at the electorate in the broad sense and thus the entire population a the court ha previously held in the light of it accessibility and it capacity to store and communicate vast amount of information the internet which includes blog and social medium see magyar helsinki bizottság v hungary gc no november play an important role in enhancing the public access to news and facilitating the dissemination of information in general see delfi a cited above however while usergenerated expressive activity on the internet provides an unprecedented platform for the exercise of freedom of expression alongside these benefit certain danger may also arise defamatory and other type of clearly unlawful speech including hate speech and speech inciting violence can be disseminated like never before ibid savva terentyev v russia no august and savcı çengel v turkey dec no may in an electoral context while political party should enjoy broad freedom of expression in order to try to convince their electorate in the case of racist or xenophobic discourse such a context may contribute to stirring up hatred and intolerance a the position of election candidate tend to become more rigid and slogan or catchphrase are given more prominence than reasonable argument the impact of racist and xenophobic discourse is then likely to become greater and more harmful see féret cited above the court reiterates that the particular responsibility of politician in combating hate speech ha also been emphasised by the committee on the elimination of racial discrimination in it general recommendation no of september see paragraph above and by ecri in it general policy recommendation no see paragraph above the court ha examined the offending remark posted by sb and lr who were not themselves politician or active member of a political party speaking on it behalf it considers that the domestic court finding regarding these post were fully justified the language used clearly incited hatred and violence against a person on account of his or her religious association and this fact can not be disguised or minimised by the electoral context see mutatis mutandis féret cited above or the intended reference to local problem the court reiterates a a matter of principle that inciting hatred doe not necessarily involve an explicit call for an act of violence or other criminal act attack on person committed by insulting holding up to ridicule or slandering certain part of the population or specific group thereof or to incite hatred and violence against a person on account of his or her religious association a wa the case in the present instance will be sufficient for the authority to seek to combat such xenophobic or otherwise discriminatory speech in response to freedom of expression which ha been exercised in an irresponsible manner and is harmful to the dignity or even the safety of those party or group ibid and atamanchuk v russia no february the court would also refer to the explanatory memorandum in respect of ecris general policy recommendation no of december see paragraph above according to which in some instance a particular feature of the use of hate speech is that it may be intended to incite or can reasonably be expected to have the effect of inciting others to commit act of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those targeted by it the element of incitement entail there being either a clear intention to bring about the commission of act of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination or an imminent risk of such act occurring a a consequence of the particular hate speech used intent to incite might be established where there is an unambiguous call by the person using hate speech for others to commit the relevant act or it might be inferred from the strength of the language used and other relevant circumstance such a the previous conduct of the speaker however the existence of intent may not always be easy to demonstrate particularly where remark are ostensibly concerned with supposed fact or coded language is being used see also kilin v russia no may the applicant liability in respect of comment by third party the court would point out that the comment in question were expressed in the context of the local political debate more specifically an election campaign for the forthcoming parliamentary election and that they were posted on the wall of the facebook account of the applicant an elected politician and candidate in those election while the court attache the utmost importance to freedom of expression in the context of political debate and considers that political discourse can not be restricted without compelling reason see paragraph above and it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinion and information of all kind are permitted to circulate freely see orlovskaya iskra v russia no february and magyar kétfarkú kutya párt cited above it would nevertheless refer back to it finding a to the clearly unlawful nature of the impugned comment see paragraph above therefore in addition to the fact that comment made in the context of political debate must not exceed certain limit particularly a regard respect for the reputation and right of others see le pen v france dec no february in view of the vital importance of combating racial discrimination in all it form and manifestation see jersild v denmark september series a no the applicant status a an elected official can not be regarded a a circumstance mitigating his liability see féret cited above in this connection the court reiterates that it is crucial for politician when expressing themselves in public to avoid comment that might foster intolerance see erbakan v turkey no july and since they too are subject to duty and responsibility under article of the convention they should also be particularly careful to defend democracy and it principle especially in an electoral context characterised a in the present case by local tension their ultimate aim being to govern see féret cited above the court note moreover that the applicant wa not reproached for using his right to freedom of expression particularly in the political debate but for his lack of vigilance and reaction to certain comment posted on the wall of his facebook account the court observes in this connection that fp wa precisely one of the applicant political opponent see paragraph above and that the event took place in a particular local political context with clear tension within the population which were evident in particular from the comment at issue but also between the protagonist the court ha previously emphasised that national authority are better placed than the court to understand and appreciate the specific societal problem faced in particular community and context see maguire v the united kingdom dec no march from this perspective the court considers that the nîmes court of appeal close knowledge of the local context of the event at issue enabled it to have a better grasp of the context of the impugned comment the court concludes from the foregoing that both the criminal court and the court of appeal based their reasoning a to the applicant liability on relevant and sufficient ground under article of the conventionβ step taken by the applicant the court note that the nîmes court of appeal held that there wa no evidence that the applicant had been informed of the content of the comment before they were posted like the firstinstance court it thus examined the applicant conduct only in relation to the period after those comment appeared the domestic court relied on a number of factor in finding the applicant liable both the criminal court and the nîmes court of appeal noted first of all that the applicant had knowingly made the wall of his facebook account public and had thus authorised his friend namely individual a at october according to the firstinstance court to post comment on it they concluded that the applicant wa therefore under an obligation to monitor the content of the comment posted moreover the criminal court emphasised that the applicant could not have been unaware of the fact that his account wa likely to attract comment with an inherently polemical political content and that he had a heightened duty to monitor them specifically see paragraph above the court of appeal considered in the same vein that his status a a political figure required him to be all the more vigilant see paragraph above the criminal court accordingly rejected the applicant argument that he had not had time to read the comment and wa not aware of what sb and lr had posted while the court of appeal pointed out that he had told the investigator that he consulted the wall of his facebook account every day the court further note that it is not in dispute that sb himself deleted the comment of which he wa the author within minute after lts arrival at his workplace the morning after it wa posted lt formally acknowledged this to the investigator stating that she had been able to see that the comment had disappeared shortly after her discussion with sb see paragraph above the impugned comment which wa in fact the only one directed at lt and wa widely relied upon by the domestic court in their reasoning wa thus promptly withdrawn by it author le than twentyfour hour after being posted accordingly assuming that the applicant had indeed had the time and opportunity to see this comment before it deletion the court considers that to require him to have acted even more promptly bearing in mind that the domestic authority were unable to show the existence of such an obligation in the light of the particular circumstance of the case would amount to requiring excessive and impracticable responsiveness see mutatis mutandis jezior cited above however the criminal court expressly found that lr comment for their part were still visible on december see paragraph above that is to say almost six week after they were posted compare delfi a cited above and pihl v sweden dec no february case where the unlawful content remained online for six week and nine day respectively contrast jezior cited above the court observes that although the applicant informed the investigator that public access to the wall of his facebook account had been removed the deletion did not take place until a few day before his interview that is to say approximately three month after the event see paragraph above even though sb had told the gendarme that he had informed the applicant of his altercation with lt on the very same day october see paragraph above admittedly on october the applicant also posted a message on his wall inviting contributor to be careful of the content of their comment but without deleting the impugned comment see paragraph above and in view of his statement that he had been unaware of lr remark before being summoned by the gendarme without having taken the trouble to check or have checked the comment that were then publicly accessible in addition in the court view there is without any doubt a shared liability between the holder of a social medium account and the operator of the network see in the same vein albeit concerning a fan page and not an individual account on facebook the cjeu judgment in unabhängiges landeszentrum für datenschutz schleswig holstein v wirtschaftsakademie schleswig holstein gmb h paragraph above moreover facebooks term of use already included the prohibition of hate speech indicating that consent to this rule wa given by all user upon accessing the network see paragraph above in these circumstance the court is of the view that the ground given by the criminal court and the court of appeal were one again in respect of the step taken by the applicant relevant and sufficient within the meaning of article of the convention it considers moreover that this finding is strengthened by the applicant claim a taken into account by the nîmes court of appeal that such comment remained within the limit of freedom of expression see paragraph and aboveγ possibility of author of comment being held liable instead the court note that the author of the impugned remark were identified whether directly by lt who immediately recognised sb see paragraph above or by the investigator in the case of lr see paragraph above it point out that the applicant wa nevertheless held liable on the basis of section of the law of july in his capacity a the producer of an online public communication site allowing internet user to post publicly accessible message and incurring liability in particular by failing to remove unlawful message a soon a he became aware of them it thus note that although the applicant wa considered by law to be the perpetrator of the offence and wa sentenced accordingly by the domestic court he had in fact been accused of conduct which wa separate from that of those who actually posted the comment on the wall of his facebook account in other word the domestic court established the fact for which the applicant wa liable and he wa not prosecuted instead of sb and lr who were dealt with separately but on account of a particular form of conduct directly linked to his status a holder of the wall of his facebook account in the court view it is legitimate for such status to entail specific obligation in particular where like the applicant the holder of a facebook wall decides not to avail himself of the possibility of restricting access to it choosing instead to make it accessible to the general public like the domestic court the court considers that this is particularly true in a context which is conducive to the expression of clearly unlawful comment a in the present case admittedly a advocated in the annex to recommendation no r of the committee of minister of the council of europe on hate speech see paragraph above domestic law and practice should draw a clear distinction between on the one hand the liability of the author of expression of hate speech and on the other the potential liability of the medium and medium professional who contribute to it dissemination a part of their task of imparting information and idea on matter of public interest in the present case however the comment were clearly unlawful see paragraph above and moreover contrary to facebooks term of use see paragraph above the domestic court therefore relied on relevant and sufficient ground in this connectionδ consequence of domestic proceeding for applicant the court observes that the applicant wa ordered to pay a fine the amount of which wa reduced by the nîmes court of appeal to an amount of euro it reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are also factor to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference see among many other authority leroy v france no october and féret cited above it take the view that having regard to the sentence and the fact that there were no other established consequence for the applicant the interference with his right to freedom of expression wa not disproportionate on this basisε conclusion in conclusion having regard to the specific circumstance of the present case the court find that the decision of the domestic court to convict the applicant for not having promptly deleted the unlawful comment posted by third party on the wall of his facebook account used in the context of his election campaign wa based on relevant and sufficient reason having regard to the margin of appreciation afforded to the respondent state the interference may thus be regarded a necessary in a democratic society accordingly there ha been no violation of article of the convention for these reason the courtdeclares unanimously the application admissible hold by six vote to one that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in french and notified in writing on september pursuant to rule and of the rule of court signatu_ victor soloveytchik síofra oleary registrar president in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rule of court the separate opinion of judge mourou vikström is annexed to this judgment solvsdissenting opinion of judge mourouvikströmi am unable to agree with the majority in finding that there ha been no violation of article of the convention this case ha presented u with a novel question the criminal liability of the holder of a facebook account in respect of message posted by third party on his or her wall could the applicant a a mere holder of a facebook account be found criminally liable on account of comment written by third party to what extent wa it possible to convict and sentence him for comment of which he wa not the author but which were indeed recognised by the court a being criminal in nature the question is all the more sensitive a the person concerned is a politician and the event took place during an election campaign on october the applicant while mayor of beaucaire chair of the front national group in the occitanie regional council and candidate in the parliamentary election wrote on his facebook account a message concerning a political opponent fp who wa an mep and deputy to the mayor of nîmes the message which unquestionably had a critical and ironical connotation read a follows while the fn ha launched it new national website on schedule spare a thought for the nîmes ump mep fp whose site which wa supposed to be launched today is displaying an ominous triple zero on it home page the jibe about the supposed incompetence of fp can unambiguously be seen in this text but it doe not a such fall foul of the criminal law it is not in dispute that the facebook account wa not administered by anyone except it holder namely the applicant or that the account wa accessible to the general public and wa not reserved merely for the holder friend thus the public nature of the account and it open access is established even though it appears that only the accepted friend were able to write comment on the same day october two message were posted on the applicant facebook page by sb and lrlt who wa fps partner filed a criminal complaint against sb lr and the applicant taking the view that the message were racist and with specific regard to the message posted by sb associated her forename a it sounded north african with her partner and with his municipal policy which according to her wa presented in such a way a to arouse a feeling of rejection visàvis muslim the author of these message together with the applicant in his capacity a holder of the facebook account were convicted with final effect by the domestic criminal court following a public prosecution and fined the applicant wa ordered to pay eur reduced to eur on appeal in addition lt a civil party in the criminal case wa awarded the sum of eur euro to be paid by the applicant and sbthe legal text on the basis of which the applicant wa convicted are section first paragraph section eighth paragraph and section of the law of july together with section of law no of july providing for the offence of incitement to hatred or violence against a person or group on account of their origin or the fact of belonging or not belonging to a specific ethnicity nation race or religion the nîmes criminal court and the nîmes court of appeal both took the view with reference to section of the law of july that the applicant even though he wa not the actual author of the offending message had to be found liable since he had chosen to make his wall public and had thereby made it available for his friend to post message that were visible to all following a confrontation with lt sb deleted the impugned message on october the day after it publication on the applicant wall the message by lr wa for it part still visible on december about six week after it publication however the applicant claimed without there being any proof or even any allegation to the contrary that he had not become aware of the impugned message by lr until a few day before he wa summoned by the investigator who interviewed him on january public access wa removed three day before he wa due to attend the police interview which would seem to corroborate the idea that his knowledge of the impugned remark did indeed coincide with the police summons his reaction in removing public access wa thus prompt at that point in this opinion i will not be analysing the merit of the conviction of the two main author of the message sb and lr but will argue that the conviction of the facebook account holder who wa found to incur specific liability is incompatible with the requirement of article of the convention in my view it is important to dissociate the fact of the present case from the position of principle a to the applicant liability for even though a case is to be adjudicated in concreto it scope is not limited to a casespecific solution a it ha much broader significance the application of this projected or derived liability of the facebook account holder is to my mind capable of breaching the right to free expression of commentator and account holder especially in the case of public figure or politician who have a large number of friend it should be noted that in the case of delfi a v estonia gc no echr the court did make a clear distinction between the delfi website which it defined a a large professionally managed internet news portal run on a commercial basis which published news article of it own and invited it reader to comment on them and other type of online forum where thirdparty comment can be disseminated for example an internet discussion forum or a bulletin board where user can freely set out their idea on any topic without the discussion being channelled by any input from the forum administrator or a social medium platform where the platform provider doe not offer content and where the content provider may be a private person running the website or blog a a hobby ibid with reference therefore to the delfi caselaw it is clear that the present applicant facebook account would fall within the second category at the very least the reason why the chamber judgment departs from the framework set out in delfi should have been explained by the majority here the same liability can not be attributed to the holder of a facebook account a to a news portal which invite it reader to make comment that are accessible to the general public and incidentally have commercial repercussion for the website delfi wa an active host whose polemical vocation wa well known thus it awareness of the message posted on it site were to be presumed such a setup can not reasonably be transposed to the user of a facebook account otherwise a the dissenting judge in delfi emphasised it would be an invitation to selfcensorship at it worst moreover the decision of the domestic court supported by the finding of no violation reached by the majority in the present judgment are not in line with the statutory prescription a interpreted by the constitutional council setting an important and clear reservation a to the criminal liability of the holder of a website that is open for comment it should be pointed out that the liability of the producer of an electronic public communication service may only be established if he or she wa aware of the message before they were posted or otherwise if he or she ha failed to act promptly to remove them upon becoming aware of them in the present case only the comment by lr should raise an issue since that of sb wa spontaneously deleted by him within twentyfour hour can the holder of a facebook account be expected to react within a few hour after the posting of a message by a third party the applicant could not reasonably have been required to have deleted sb message within a twentyfour hour period otherwise the obligation to react would be excessive and impracticable moreover a to the message posted by lr is it possible to prove that the applicant wa aware of it to establish criminal liability any knowledge he may have had of lr message can not be a matter of speculation or even presumption it requires evidence the domestic court however failed to demonstrate the existence of such knowledge preferring to base their reasoning on a general obligation to monitor comment particularly relying on the applicant status a a politician while it is true that on october two day after lr comment the applicant invited his friend in a message on his facebook wall to be careful with the content of their comment there is nothing to suggest that he wa aware of the impugned comment by lr he might well have been referring implicitly when making this appeal for vigilance to the other message that sb had posted and promptly deleted bearing in mind that knowledge is one of the basic element for the purpose of establishing the criminal liability of the account holder it must be demonstrated in compliance with the rule of criminal law which it go without saying have to be interpreted strictly therefore only an unequivocal message by an individual feeling offended by the comment or simply condemning them for falling within the scope of the law on incitement to hatred would have been such a to prove that the applicant had been aware of the impugned comment but no such message exists it is not in dispute that lt did not seek to warn the applicant about the content of lr message or even that of sb message the domestic court based their decision to convict the applicant on the following finding the fact that the applicant a a politician could not have been unaware that his account would generate and encourage message that would be in essence political and therefore polemical in this connection it is noteworthy that the message that the applicant himself had initially published wa admittedly critical of and mocked his political opponent but it had not been directed against any part of the population and still le incited hatred against anyone the liability of the applicant who had taken the initiative of setting up an electronic public communication platform and had failed to delete with sufficient rapidity the comment posted by certain friend that he had accepted on facebook it should be noted straight away that the fact that sb informed the applicant of his discussion with lt and of the subsequent withdrawal of his message is not such a to place on the applicant a duty of heightened vigilance extending to a presumption that he wa aware of the other comment posted on his wall it is important to dissociate this case from the context and even the content of the impugned remark in order to focus solely on the criminal liability of the facebook account holder where he or she is like the applicant a public figure the finding of no violation of article of the convention place a very heavy burden on the account holder in term of monitoring post since he or she would otherwise face criminal prosecution there is a risk that such a fear will cause the account holder to systematically vet and even to censor certain comment posted on his or her wall in case of doubt a to the legal consequence of a comment posted by someone else the account holder will of course be more inclined to delete or report a message by way of precaution the chilling effect is selfevident thus entailing a serious threat to freedom of expression,,,
71,the applicant wa born in and life in béziers the applicant is the former head of the basque separatist organisation iparretarrak after his detention in he wa convicted several time on march he wa sentenced to six year imprisonment for criminal association with a view to preparing a terrorist offence on november he wa sentenced to life imprisonment for murder in the framework of terrorist

it judgment that the applicant release on licence would be accompanied by the following general obligation article of the penal code complying with the instruction of the sentence enforcement judge or of the social worker from the prison rehabilitation and probation service receiving visit from the latter and providing him or her with information or document facilitating supervision of his livelihood and compliance with his obligation informing the social worker of any job change and if such change are liable to hamper compliance with his obligation obtaining prior authorisation from the sentence enforcement judge informing the social worker of any change of address and of any travel lasting for more than two week reporting back to the latter on his return and obtaining the authorisation of the sentence enforcement judge for any foreign travel and for any change of job or of address liable to impede compliance with his obligation the division added the following special obligation article and of the penal code exercising an occupation or following vocational education or training residing in béziers continuing in accordance with his mean to pay into the guarantee fund for the compensation of victim of terrorism and refraining from possessing or carrying a weapon on november the criminal chamber of the court of cassation dismissed the appeal on point of law lodged by the public prosecutor with the paris court of appeal on december the applicant took part in a peaceful demonstration outside agen prison in support of basque detainee being held there the medium reported on that demonstration consequently the paris sentence enforcement court delivered a judgment on may imposing additional special obligation on the applicant refraining from attending in the vicinity of a prison or other detention facility any demonstration in support of person detained for terrorist offence or of any association or movement which is committing or ha committed terrorist act article of the penal code refraining from distributing any document or audiovisual material produced or coproduced by himself concerning in whole or in part an offence committed by himself and refraining from discussing that offence in public article of the penal code that judgment wa upheld by judgment of the paris court of appeal on october however the latter judgment wa quashed by judgment of the criminal chamber of the court of cassation on june on the ground that the sentence enforcement court did not have jurisdiction to modify the obligation for release on licence for which matter the sentence enforcement judge held jurisdiction on february the public prosecutor office requested that the sentence enforcement judge of the regional court of paris add both the aforementioned obligation to the applicant list of obligation for release on licence a well a a prohibition on contacting any person actively engaged in promoting basque separatism or supporting

coproduced by himself concerning in whole or in part the offence committed and refraining from discussing that offence in public whereby these provision are applicable only in case of conviction for serious offence of intentional homicide sexual assault or sexual abuse he noted that in it judgment of february the paris court of appeal had described the applicant a a calm respectful person who spent most of his time writing his memoir the judge inferred that although it is unclear what the word memoir entail it is quite possible that mr bidart might be tempted to publish his memoir and make statement on the offence of which he wa convicted nor did the judgment go into further detail on that point it explained however that during the adversarial proceeding mr bidart wa reminded that the prosecution had requested the prohibition only of writing or statement connected with the offence of which he had been convicted that judgment wa upheld by judgment of the paris court of appeal on august stating that the obligation in question merely prohibited commenting on or condoning the offence committed and that the obligation wa not a disproportionate measure in the light of the need to protect public order nor doe it prevent philippe bidart from expressing his political conviction by judgment of march the criminal division of the court of cassation dismissed the appeal on point of law lodged by the applicant on the ground that in it judgment the court of appeal had properly applied article of the penal code in compliance with the legal text and convention relevant to the applicant appeal including article of the convention the lawi alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant complained that his freedom of expression had been restricted in the framework of his release on licence he relied on article of the convention which read a follows everyone ha the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinion and to receive and impart information and idea without interference by public authority and regardless of frontier this article shall not prevent state from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprise the exercise of these freedom since it carry with it duty and responsibility may be subject to such formality condition restriction or penalty a are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or moral for the protection of the reputation or right of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary the government contested that argument b merit the partiesa the applicant the applicant submitted that when the paris court of appeal had initially decided to release him on licence it had not considered it necessary to impose any obligation affecting his freedom of expression that he had always scrupulously honoured all the obligation imposed on him in the framework of his release on licence and that he had at no stage since his release condoned the offence of which he had been convicted in his view that fact demonstrated that there wa no need for such a restriction whose disproportionality also stemmed from it general nature which afforded the judicial authority a very wide margin of appreciation in fact the restriction wa tantamount to banning him from voicing any opinion on the current political situation in the basque country since the offence of which he had been convicted had been committed in that context the applicant took the view that despite the careful language used by the french judge the real purpose of the obligation in question wa to prohibit him from uttering any statement concerning the history and the political context of the northern basque country it wa therefore an attempt unjustifiably to infringe his freedom of opinion and expression particularly a it transpired from article of the code of criminal procedure that only measure aimed at the convicted person rehabilitation and prevention of recidivism could be imposed in the framework of release on licenceb the government the government agreed that the prohibition imposed on the applicant amounted to an interference in the exercise of his right to freedom of expression they considered however that that interference wa prescribed by law that is to say in article of the penal code which met the requirement of precision and clarity set out in the caselaw of the court particularly since the sentence enforcement judge and the court of appeal had pointed out that the measure imposed merely prohibited commenting on or condoning the offence committed and the applicant had not been banned from expressing his political conviction a regard the meaning of the word condoning apologie in french we might refer to the definition given in the larousse dictionary commending or justifying something presented in a document or a speech speech or document glorifying an act expressly prohibited by law eg condoning murder or racial hatred the government submitted that the interference had pursued several of the legitimate aim listed in the second paragraph of article the protection of public safety prevention of disorder or crime and the protection of the reputation or right of others namely those of the victim of the crime committed by the applicant and of their family on the latter point they emphasised that the applicant release on licence had caused much emotion not only among the victim family but also more broadly within the local population particularly because on the one hand on leaving the prison the applicant had given a speech in basque stating that his joy at being free wa not complete because the french state did not recognise the basque country and on the other hand a few month later he had taken part in a demonstration in support of basque prisoner during which he had denounced the injustice of the situation of those political prisoner and stated that they should be released according to the government therefore the aim had been to prevent any act or comment likely to offend the victim family and any further criminal activity with reference to the judgment in the case of leroy v france no october the government observed that in the court view the legitimacy of the aim pursued by the interference should be assessed in the light of the sensitivity of the endeavour to combat terrorism and the need for the authority to remain vigilant about act liable to increase the attendant violence the government further considered that the interference had been necessary in a democratic society they referred to zana v turkey november report of judgment and decision vii where the court had stated that it had with due regard to the circumstance of each case and a state margin of appreciation to ascertain whether a fair balance had been struck between the individual fundamental right to freedom of expression and a democratic society legitimate right to protect itself against the activity of terrorist organisation they pointed out that the court had already had occasion to consider the situation in the basque country in the case of leroy cited above and association ekin v france no echr viii a regard the proportionality of the measure they emphasised first of all that article of the penal code limited the scope of the impugned restriction to specific offence considered a extremely serious and that the provision only applied to person who were on probation were serving a semicustodial sentence or had been released on licence and that that restriction wa implemented strictly in the framework and context of release on licence that is to say in the context of individualised penalty aimed at the early release of a convicted person under certain condition with the fundamental aim of facilitating his rehabilitation a that aim required the person concerned to stand back from the offence which he had committed it had not been disproportionate to expect the applicant to refrain from any circulation of writing or document or any public speech amounting to commenting on or condoning offence which had offended large section of the general public furthermore regard should be had to the fact that the impugned obligation had been imposed on the applicant following his participation in a demonstration outside agen prison in support of basque prisoner which the domestic court availing themselves of their discretionary power had regarded a conduct incompatible with his rehabilitation a it had been liable to expose him to risk of recidivism and to cause public disorder according to the government the obligation had been linked to the situation and conduct of the applicant who had held a special position in the basque terrorist organisation owing to the influence of his word it had been necessary to take precaution to ensure that others did not interpret his word and behaviour a a call to further violence secondly according to the government the impugned restriction had been strictly limited in it purpose because it had only covered utterance on the offence of which the applicant had been convicted moreover although the applicant had run the risk of having his release on licence revoked in the event of noncompliance with that obligation such a sanction which wa left to the discretion of the judge would not have been automatic and could only have been a partial revocation they added that the revocation had been limited in time because it ended a required on expiry of the release licence the court the court note that in the framework of the applicant release on licence the domestic court had in particular imposed on him the obligation to refrain from circulating any document or audiovisual material produced or coproduced by himself concerning the offence of which he had been convicted and to refrain from making any public reference to those offence that is obviously a restriction on the exercise of his freedom of expression within the meaning of article of the convention which fact moreover the government do not deny such an interference infringes that provision unless it is prescribed by law pursues one or more of the legitimate aim set out in article and is necessary in a democratic society to attain those aim the court first of all note that the legal basis of the restriction is provided by article of the code of criminal procedure and article of the penal code which state in particular that the sentence enforcement judge can make the release on licence of a person convicted of serious offence of intentional homicide subject to an obligation to refrain from circulating any document or audiovisual material produced or coproduced by himself concerning the offence committed and to refrain from making any public reference to that offence the court consequently concludes that the restriction wa prescribed by law secondly it note that the government refer to several of the legitimate aim listed in article the protection of public safety prevention of disorder or crime and the protection of the reputation or right of others it observes however that the domestic court concentrated solely on the fact that the impugned measure wa necessary for the prevention of public disorder see paragraph and above that being the case the court take note of the government explanation to the effect that the release on licence of the applicant a former head of the basque separatist organisation iparretarrak who had been sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of three person in a terrorist context had caused widespread emotion among the victim family and more broadly within the local population it observes a stated by the government that the impugned measure wa taken a few month after the beginning of the applicant release on licence following his participation in a peaceful demonstration outside agen prison in support of basque prisoner who were held there which participation had attracted medium coverage the court also understands why in that context the judicial authority might have feared that the applicant would place himself in a position conducive to possible recidivism it therefore accepts having regard to the situation prevailing in the basque country see association ekin cited above that the restriction complained of pursued one of the aim listed in article namely prevention of disorder or crime the fundamental principle a regard the necessity in a democratic society of an interference with the exercise of freedom of expression are well established in the court caselaw and may be summarised a follows see among other authority hertel v switzerland august case report vi steel and morris v the united kingdom no echr ii mouvement raëlien suisse v switzerland gc no echr animal defender international v the united kingdom gc no echr morice v france gc no april and delfi a v estonia gc no echr i freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic condition for it progress and for each individual selffulfilment subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or idea that are favourably received or regarded a inoffensive or a a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb such are the demand of pluralism tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society a set forth in article this freedom is subject to exception which must however be construed strictly and the need for any restriction must be established convincingly ii the adjective necessary within the meaning of article implies the existence of a pressing social need the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists but it go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those given by an independent court the court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression a protected by article iii the court task in exercising it supervisory jurisdiction is not to take the place of the competent national authority but rather to review under article the decision they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation this doe not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent state exercised it discretion reasonably carefully and in good faith what the court ha to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case a a whole and determine whether it wa proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reason adduced by the national authority to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court ha to satisfy itself that the national authority applied standard which were in conformity with the principle embodied in article and moreover that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant fact in leroy cited above relating to the publication of a satirical drawing in a basque weekly magazine and zana cited above referred to by the government the court pointed out that those principle apply to measure taken by national authority to maintain national security and public safety a part of the fight against terrorism and that it must with due regard to the circumstance of each case and a state margin of appreciation ascertain whether a fair balance ha been struck between the individual fundamental right to freedom of expression and a democratic society legitimate right to protect itself against the activity of terrorist organisation these consideration are relevant to the present case mutatis mutandis the court ha also emphasised that although article doe not a such prohibit prior restraint on publication or ban on distribution of information or idea the danger which restriction of that kind pose for a democratic society are such that they call for the most careful scrutiny on the part of the court see in particular association ekin cited above and éditions plon v france no echr iv that is particularly true in the case of measure to prevent the distribution of comment which are only potential at the time of adoption of the former in the present case therefore the court is concerned by the fact that when deciding to impose the impugned restriction on the applicant the sentence enforcement judge did not base his decision on the latter specific comment or writing but on potential comment or writing stating that it wa quite possible that he might be tempted to publish his memoir and make statement on the offence of which he wa convicted the court further considers it regrettable that the domestic judge neither balanced the competing interest nor fully characterised the risk of public disorder that being the case the court note that decision to apply article of the code of criminal procedure are not administrative but judicial because they are taken by the sentence enforcement judge and the convicted person in question can lodge an ordinary appeal followed by an appeal on point of law it note that the applicant availed himself of that right since he appealed to the paris court of appel against the judgment imposing the impugned obligation emphasising in particular that that obligation merely prohibited him commenting on or condoning the offence committed that it wa not a disproportionate measure in the light of the need to protect public order and that it in no way prevented him from expressing his political conviction and that he subsequently appealed on point of law to the court of cassation see paragraph and above he therefore benefited from judicial review providing genuine safeguard against abuse to which procedure the court attache great importance see association ekin cited above the court further note that the measure taken pursuant to paragraph of that article are limited in three respect they are limited with regard to the person on whom they can be imposed a they apply solely to person convicted of specific crime or offence culpable injury of life sexual assault or sexual abuse they are also limited not only in time ending at the same time a the period of release on licence but also in their purpose since they can only affect the person freedom of expression on the offence which he or she had committed in the present case moreover the paris court of appeal very clearly reiterated in it judgment of august that the restriction imposed on the applicant merely prohibited commenting on or condoning the offence committed see paragraph above it would therefore seem that contrary to his allegation the applicant retained the right to express his view on the basque question provided that he did not mention the offence of which he had been convicted when the court ass an interference with the right secured under article it also attache great importance to the limited nature of the measure adopted see for example donaldson v the united kingdom dec january furthermore the present case should also been seen in the light mutatis mutandis of the case of nilsen v the united kingdom dec no march in which relying on his freedom of expression a prisoner complained of the fact that the manuscript of his autobiography had been confiscated on the ground in particular that it had gone into detail on the crime of which he had been convicted while reiterating that prisoner in general continue to enjoy all the fundamental right and freedom guaranteed under the convention save for the right to liberty and in particular the right to freedom of expression and any restriction must be specifically justified in each case the court found that the complaint under article wa manifestly illfounded owing in particular to the fact that the impugned measure had not amounted to a complete restriction on the exercise of the right set out in that provision finally the court can not overlook the context in which the applicant freedom of expression wa restricted that is to say that the decision wa taken to restrict that right in the framework of the early release of a major wellknown figure in a terrorist organisation who had been sentenced to life imprisonment for murder committed in a terrorist context which early release a already mentioned in paragraph above had caused considerable emotion among the victim family and more broadly within the local population all these factor lead the court to accept that in imposing on the applicant in the framework of his release on licence the obligation to refrain from distributing any document or audiovisual material produced or coproduced by himself concerning in whole or in part the offence of which he wa convicted and to refrain from making any public reference to those offence the domestic court did not exceed the margin of appreciation available to them therefore there wa no violation of article of the convention for these reason the court unanimously hold that there ha been no violation of article of the convention done in french and notified in writing on november pursuant to rule and of the rule of court milan blaško josep casadevall deputy registrar president,,,
72,the applicant company is a limited liability company and is the owner of the greek television channel alpha on january alpha broadcast a television show named jungle ζούγκλα in which three video that had been filmed with a hidden camera were broadcast in the first video ac then a member of the hellenic parliament and chairman of the interparty committee on electronic gambling wa shown entering a gambling arcade and playing on two machine the second video showed a meeting between ac and associate of the television host of jungle mt during which the first video wa shown to ac the third video showed a meeting between ac and mt in the latter office on january the video were shown again during a television show named yellow press κίτρινος τύπος presented by the same television host on may the national radio and television council εθνικό συμβούλιο ραδιοτηλεόρασης following an invitation to the applicant company held a hearing in which the applicant company wa represented by it attorney a can be seen from the minute of the meeting the applicant company attorney acknowledged the use of hidden camera in the abovementioned incident they argued that such use had been justified owing to ac being a public figure and that it had served the public interest a proven by the fact that the report had resulted in ac being dismissed from the parliamentary group of the political party for which he had been elected a parliamentary deputy in their view that had been the result not only of ac gambling activity but also of the fact that he had tried to negotiate with the applicant company reporter to present the incident differently the applicant company attorney further argued that the use of a hidden camera had been exceptional and had been resorted to following the receipt of information that could not have been verified otherwise a nobody would have believed the journalist allegation if they had reported on the issue without broadcasting the image it can also be seen from the minute that the member of the national radio and television council expressed their disagreement regarding the use of a hidden camera arguing that if anyone were able to use a hidden camera by claiming that there wa an overriding public interest in doing so then all citizen especially if they were public figure would be exposed to the possibility of being subject to pressure and extortion they furthermore stressed that nobody would ever forbid journalist to report on a certain issue however the mean used raised an issue a the use of hidden camera could be accepted only in respect of a national security issue or for the prevention of a serious crime or other similar situation they also noted that there were two separate issue in the instant case on the one hand the use of a hidden camera and on the other hand the entrapment of ac by it decision the national radio and television council ordered the applicant company to pay one hundred thousand euro eur for each of the two television show during which the abovementioned video were shown a well a to broadcast on three day in a row on it main news show the content of that decision the decision included a short description of the three video a citation of the relevant legislation and the conclusion that the use of hidden camera in that case had not been in accordance with the relevant law it further stated that the sanction had been imposed following an assessment of the gravity of the offence of the number of viewer of the two television show of the size of the investment that had been made by the applicant company and the fact that the television channel had been repeatedly fined in the past for the same offence on june the decision of the national radio and television council wa communicated to the minister of press and medium who after examining it legality issued decision no e confirming it content on april the applicant company lodged an application for annulment αίτηση ακύρωσης against the decision of the national radio and television council and the minister of press and medium with the supreme administrative court συμβούλιο της επικρατείας on the ground that the abovementioned decision had violated article and of the greek constitution a well a article of the convention ac lodged a thirdparty intervention requesting from the supreme administrative court to dismiss the application for annulment on january the president of the supreme administrative court referred the case to the plenary supreme administrative court owing to it high importance the hearing before the plenary supreme administrative court took place on june by it judgment no published on april and finalised on may δημοσίευση και καθαρογραφή the supreme administrative court dismissed the application for annulment in it legal assessment the majority of the supreme administrative court firstly referred to the constitutional provision providing the right to impart and receive information and then emphasised that this right is subject to limitation whose legitimate aim is the protection of the right of others and the observance of the rule of law on condition that those limitation are proportionate it additionally referred to the court caselaw in respect of article and on article with specific reference to caselaw concerning the protection of a person image see von hannover v germany no echr vi schüssel v austria dec no february and sciacca v italy no echr i it continued by noting that under article of the constitution the state ha the legal duty to exercise control over the radio and television in order to ensure respect for human value and that sanction imposed by the national radio and television council served that purpose the supreme administrative court laid down the condition under which it is legitimate to broadcast an image that ha been filmed with the method of hidden camera by making a distinction between reporting on specific news whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret mean and the broadcasting of the relevant secretly recorded image according to that reasoning recording by secret mean an image which ha a it main or only subject a specific person constitutes in principle a violation of that person right to his own image which is protected by article of the constitution and of the convention a a specific aspect of the right to respect for one private life consequently the broadcasting on television of news whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret mean can not in principle be considered a constituting the legitimate exercise of the right to impart information given that the disseminated news ha been received under circumstance which constitute a violation of an individual right to his own image nevertheless in certain case it may be considered justified to broadcast such news on account of it contribution to a debate of general interest and taking into account the secretly recorded person position or standing however even when broadcasting of the news is considered a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information this doe not automatically render legitimate the broadcasting of the relevant secretly recorded image a that constitutes a much more intense έντονος limitation of the constitutionally protected right of that person to his own image than the simple transmission of news in the domestic court view broadcasting of a secretly recorded image can only be justified if the legitimate for the reason mentioned above broadcasting of such news is completely impossible or particularly difficult without broadcasting the image that wa recorded by hidden mean and which constitutes the source of the news by applying the abovementioned principle to the circumstance of the case the supreme administrative court dismissed the applicant company argument that it had legitimately transmitted the news concerning ac in view of ac capacity a a public figure the domestic court stressed that from the text of the decision and from the minute of the meeting of the national radio and television council it derived that the sanction wa imposed to the applicant company solely and exclusively on account of the broadcast of the image that had been recorded by hidden mean and not on account of the transmission of the news whose source had been the secretly recorded image a far a the broadcasting of the image wa concerned the applicant company had not disputed that the image had been recorded by secret mean and had not claimed that broadcasting of the news wa absolutely impossible or extremely difficult without broadcasting the relevant image therefore the applicant company allegation that it had broadcast the impugned image for reason of journalistic interest and of public interest wa dismissed on the basis of the abovementioned reasoning the supreme administrative court ruled that the decision of the national radio and television council had been fully reasoned and dismissed the applicant company application for annulment a concurring more specific ειδικότερη opinion wa joined to the majority opinion the seven judge considered that the recording of a person without his knowledge and the use of it for the broadcasting of news constituted a direct violation of that person right to dignity a it reduces him to an instrument for others to achieving goal that are irrelevant to him given that pursuant to article and of the constitution the protection of human dignity is absolute the broadcasting of such news is always forbidden irrespective of whether such a broadcast includes the image in question for those reason the judge who supported this opinion considered that the application for annulment should be dismissed in addition there were two dissenting opinion according to the first one in view of the fact that the national radio and television council had considered that the broadcasting of news that had been recorded by secret mean had constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information the same consideration should be extended to the broadcasting of the relevant image the reason for this wa the special nature of television in comparison with the other medium owing to which the broadcasting of the image went handinhand with broadcasting the news itself therefore the application for annulment should have been allowed given that the national radio and television council decision had been based solely on the fact that the image of ac had been recorded by hidden mean without considering whether broadcasting news whose source wa the above image constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information lastly according to the other dissenting opinion no constitutional provision justified the absolute protection of an image a wa held by the majority a person right to his own image wa susceptible to limitation that varied according to that person position and the space in which the recording in question had taken place for individual protection against the recording of their image without their consent wa absolute irrespective of whether it took place in a public or private space unless the recording wa not directed to them or the recording of the image took place with a view to the prevention of crime in public space for public figure however protection wa le absolute in particular public figure such a politician were exposed to publicity and sometimes they even pursued it a a result there wa a legitimate expectation on the part of the medium and of the public to impart and receive information regarding their public activity for these person there wa an absolute protection of their image in their private space and in public space in which they shared private or family moment when however public figure were in public space but not under the condition described above or acted in a way that wa of interest to the public such a in case in which they engaged in behaviour contrary to what their public role entailed or contrary to the image they projected towards the public then the right to receive and impart information could justify the recording of that person without his consent and the broadcasting of the relevant image by the medium in this regard the dissenting judge argued that it would be inconceivable to equate radio with television a they did not operate on the same way therefore it would not be possible for a television show to simply announce the news without broadcasting the relevant image a would be the case on the radio in respect of legitimately recorded image when there is a balance between transparency and the right to receive information on the one hand and the protection of a person image on the other hand the presumption should be that the recorded image could be broadcast without consent in view of the above the four judge considered that the application for annulment should be allowed taking into account especially the fact that ac wa a public figure that the recording of his image had taken place in a public space that is to say in a gambling arcade and that the broadcasting of the relevant image had served the purpose of informing the public of behaviour on the part of a member of parliament that did not meet the requirement of his position therefore the television channel decision to broadcast the image a a part of the television show which otherwise could be considered unfounded or even defamatory had not breached the proportionality principle ii relevant domestic lawa the constitution the relevant article of the greek constitution provide a follows article a all person have the right to information a specified by law restriction on this right may be imposed by law only in so far a they are absolutely necessary and justified for reason of national security combating crime or

judiciary a admissibility the court note that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party argumentsa the applicant company argument the applicant company maintained that the decision of the national radio and television council to impose administrative sanction on it on account of the three video that had been filmed with a hidden camera and broadcast in two of it television show had violated it right to freedom of expression in particular the applicant company argued that the fine imposed on it specifically eur in respect of each of the two television show during which the video had been broadcast a well a the obligation to broadcast the content of the abovementioned decision had interfered with it right to freedom of expression and in particular with it right to impart information the applicant company argued that the image recorded by the use of a hidden camera concerned the behaviour of a public figure who had been at the time a member of the hellenic parliament and chairman of the interparty committee on the widespread use of electronic gambling therefore his participation in gambling game had been a matter of public interest in the light of ac public role and could have affected his duty a a member of parliament and a chairman of the parliamentary committee on electronic gambling viewer had had the right to learn the truth about an elected deputy in any event electronic gambling had been a matter of general interest in greece at the time a many citizen had been financially destroyed owing to their participation in similar game that had been the reason why the two television show had prepared the broadcast in question in view of the above the broadcasting of video that had been filmed by the use of a hidden camera had been necessary and ac right to private life had been outweighed by the applicant company right to impart information concerning a matter of public interest both the national radio and television council which had imposed the administrative sanction and the supreme administrative court which had dismissed the application for annulment had failed in the present case to strike a fair balance between the applicant company right under article and ac right under article of the convention in addition the broadcasting of the second video had been necessary a it had showed that ac had tried to negotiate with the journalist who had filmed the first incident in particular ac had appeared to request that the journalist present the incident a if he had been gambling in order to experiment within the context of his parliamentary duty in exchange he offered to appear live on the television show in the applicant company view such behaviour on the part of a public figure had had to be exposed therefore the broadcasting of that video had been necessary and had fulfilled part of the applicant company duty to inform the public pursuant to article of the convention the applicant company maintained that a far a the first video wa concerned ac had been filmed in a public space namely in a gambling arcade in addition the use of hidden camera had been necessary in order to document and prove his behaviour a he would never have given his consent to being filmed playing on gambling machine a proven by the fact that he had tried to negotiate with the journalist in order that the filmed incident might be presented differently lastly the applicant company argued that in any event the fine that had been imposed on it by the national radio and television council had not been proportionate to the offence in question and stressed that the imposition of similar sanction were jeopardising television role in disseminating news a protected by article of the conventionb the government argument the government contested the argument that there had been any interference with the applicant company right to impart information or with the public right to receive information in particular the government argued that the decision of the national radio and television council had made it clear that the sanction were being imposed because of the broadcasting of image that had been captured using a hidden camera and not because of the broadcasting of the legitimately transmitted news that ac had been spotted entering a gambling arcade and playing on gambling machine the same consideration applied to the second video the sanction had been imposed because of the broadcasting of the image and not because of the transmission of the news of the meeting that had taken place between ac and the television station reporter the government further maintained that even if it were to be accepted that there had been interference with the applicant company right under article of the convention such interference had been prescribed by the domestic legislation namely article of the constitution article c of law no article and of regulation and article of regulation of the national radio and television council and article b and f of the code on journalistic ethic issued by the journalist union additionally the government asserted that any interference with the applicant company right to impart information had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the right and reputation of others specifically ac right to private life a protected under article of the convention in respect of the necessity of the alleged interference the government stressed that all three video had been filmed by illegitimate mean namely a hidden camera without the consent and knowledge of ac and in violation of the relevant legislation in addition the image on all three video a well a the filmed conversation of ac with journalist on the second and third video had breached criminal law and in particular article a of the criminal code therefore the applicant company had been aware that it had breached all the abovementioned provision of domestic legislation by filming and broadcasting the impugned video in the government view the applicant company had not advanced any argument a to why the broadcasting of the video had been necessary and why it had not been sufficient to merely broadcast the news without showing the video that had been recorded in violation of ac right to his own image the video had not contributed to a public debate but had merely satisfied the public curiosity and had been used a a mean of securing higher rating for the programme this could not have been considered a legitimate reason for violating ac right to his own image in view of the above the national radio and television council which considered that the applicant company could have broadcast the news but not the video that had been the source of the news and had consequently imposed sanction on the applicant company had not erred but had struck a fair balance between the right protected under article and of the convention referring to the court caselaw bédat v switzerland gc no echr the government argued that the sanction imposed had constituted an exercise of the positive obligation arising from article in order to effectively protect ac right to his own image in addition it had been in accordance with the court caselaw which made clear that the wide protection afforded to the press did not mean that journalist were not obliged to respect national legislation and the code on journalistic ethic the alleged interference had addressed a pressing social need namely that in a democratic society dialogue should be conducted without the use of mean which harmed the reputation and image of individual unless such mean contributing to a public debate lastly a regard the proportionality of the interference the government stressed that the plenary supreme administrative court had found the sanction proportionate a it had been clear that the national radio and television council had taken into account the gravity of the offence a well a the applicant company previouslyincurred sanction for similar offence in the past in addition national legislation provided for far more severe sanction than the one imposed on the applicant company the court assessmenta the existence of interference the court note that it is in dispute between the party whether the imposition on the applicant company of the fine and the obligation to broadcast the content of the relevant decision imposed constituted interference with it freedom of expression in particular the government maintained that the sanction imposed on the applicant company had not interfered with it freedom of expression a they had not concerned the broadcasting of the news the source of which wa the video that had been filmed with a hidden camera but the projection of the video themselves which had been filmed by illicit mean the court note that it ha consistently held that freedom of expression includes the publication of photograph von hannover v germany no gc no and echr similarly freedom of expression ha been considered to include the broadcasting of video see haldimann and others v switzerland no echr it additionally note that it is not for the court any more than it is for the national court to substitute it own view for those of the press a to what technique of reporting should be adopted in a particular case see jersild v denmark september series a no and stoll v switzerland gc no echr v consequently the court considers that the sanction imposed on the applicant company on account of it broadcasting the impugned video constituted interference with it freedom of expression such interference will infringe the convention unless it satisfies the requirement of paragraph of article the court must therefore determine whether it wa prescribed by law pursued one or more of the legitimate aim set out in that paragraph and wa necessary in a democratic society to achieve those aimsb prescribed by law it ha not been disputed that the legal basis for the imposition of the sanction on the applicant company wa article of the constitution article c of law no article and of regulation and article of regulation of the national radio and television council and article b and f of the code on journalistic ethic the court thus concludes that the impugned interference wa prescribed by law within the meaning of the second paragraph of article of the conventionc legitimate aim the government submitted that the imposition of sanction on the applicant company had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation and right of others specifically of ac the applicant company did not contest that argument the court observes that ac image and voice were recorded without his knowledge and then broadcast against his will in a television programme with high viewing figure it therefore considers that the measure in issue pursued the aim of protecting the right and reputation of others specifically ac right to respect for his image word and reputationd necessary in a democratic societyi general principle the general principle governing an assessment of whether an interference with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression is necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention are wellsettled in the court caselaw they were recently restated in pentikäinen v finland gc no echr bédat cited above and couderc and hachette filipacchi associés v france gc no echr extract the court note that account must be taken of the need to strike the right balance between the various interest involved because of their direct continuous contact with the reality of the country a state court are in a better position than an international court to determine how at a given time the right balance can be struck for this reason in matter under article of the convention the contracting state have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity and scope of any interference in the freedom of expression protected by that article in particular when a balance ha to be struck between conflicting private interest see among other authority palomo sánchez and others v spain gc no and echr however this margin go hand in hand with european supervision embracing both the legislation and the decision applying it even those delivered by an independent court in exercising it supervisory function the court task is not to take the place of the national court but rather to review in the light of the case a a whole whether the decision they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation are compatible with the provision of the convention relied on if the balance struck by the national judicial authority is unsatisfactory in particular because the importance or the scope of one of the fundamental right at stake wa not duly considered the margin of appreciation accorded to the decision of the national court will be a narrow one see aksu v turkey gc no and echr where however the exercise of striking a balance between two conflicting right wa undertaken by the national authority in conformity with the criterion laid down in the court caselaw the court would require strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see von hannover no cited above and couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above the court reiterates that the outcome of the application should not in theory vary according to whether it ha been lodged with the court under article of the convention by the person who wa the subject of the news report or under article by the publisher indeed a a matter of principle these right deserve equal respect see von hannover no cited above accordingly the margin of appreciation should in theory be the same in both case the court ha identified in so far a relevant to the present case the following criterion within the context of balancing competing right the contribution to a debate of public interest the degree to which the person affected is wellknown the subject of the news report the method of obtaining the information and it veracity the prior conduct of the person concerned the content form and consequence of the publication and the severity of the sanction imposed see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above axel springer ag v germany gc no february and von hannover no cited above in addition the court reiterates that it is commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual medium often have a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print medium see jersild cited above and peck v the united kingdom no echr i accordingly although freedom of expression also extends to the publication of photograph the court recall that this is an area in which the protection of the right of others take on particular importance especially where the image contain very personal and intimate information about an individual or where they are taken on private premise and clandestinely through the use of secret recording device see von hannover cited above hachette filipacchi associés ici paris v france no july and mgn limited v the united kingdom no january factor relevant to an assessment of where the balance between competing interest lie include the additional contribution made by the publication of the photograph to a debate of general interest a well a the content of the photograph see krone verlag gmb h co kg v austria no february ii application of the above principle in the present caseα contribution of the report to a debate of public interest an initial essential criterion is the contribution made by article in the press to a debate of public interest the court ha previously recognised the existence of such an interest where the publication concerned political issue or crime see axel springer ag cited above with further reference the applicant company maintained that the video had been disseminated within the context of two television broadcast devoted to the social issue of gambling and had contributed to the public debate concerning that issue which had been a widespread problem in greece at the time it additionally claimed that the video had included information concerning the conduct of ac a member of the greek parliament at the time who had also been chairman of the interparty committee on electronic gambling and that they therefore concerned in general a matter of public interest that is to say the conduct of an elected representative the government contested the argument that the video might have made an additional contribution to the debate of public interest arguing that they had merely served the purpose of securing higher programme rating the court note that both the national radio and television council and the supreme administrative court by applying the relevant legislation and principle and acknowledging that the news had been lawfully broadcast implicitly acknowledged that the subject of the report concerned a matter of public interest in addition they had considered that the applicant company had been entitled to report on the issue they had only contested the applicant company entitlement to broadcast the impugned video in addition to the news itself see paragraph above the court assessing the report a a whole a well a the substance of the information that is disclosed in it and having regard to the observation of the domestic authority see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above agrees with the domestic authority assessment of whether the report wa in the public interest it note in particular that the widespread use of gambling constituted a debate of considerable public interest turning to whether the report in question wa capable of contributing to the public debate at issue see stoll cited above echr v the court observes that the report in question wa not without political import in particular it could arouse the interest of the public with regard to the conduct of an elected representative visàvis electronic gambling who additionally wa chairman of an interparty committee on electronic gamblingβ degree of notoriety of the person affected and the subject of the report the court reiterates that the role or function of the person concerned and the nature of the activity that are the subject of the news report andor photograph constitute another important criterion to be taken into consideration see von hannover no cited above and axel springer cited above the extent to which an individual ha a public profile or is wellknown influence the protection that may be afforded to his or her private life thus the court ha acknowledged on numerous occasion that the public wa entitled to be informed about certain aspect of the private life of public figure see inter alia karhuvaara and iltalehti v finland no echr x nevertheless in certain circumstance even where a person is known to the general public he or she may rely on a legitimate expectation of protection of and respect for his or her private life see inter alia von hannover no cited above thus the fact that an individual belongs to the category of public figure can not in any way even in the case of person exercising official function authorise the medium to violate the professional and ethical principle which must govern their action or legitimise intrusion into private life see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above in the present case the court note that ac a a member of parliament and the chairman of the interparty committee on electronic gambling wa undeniably a prominent political figure the domestic authority ought therefore to have considered the extent to which this prominence and those public function were capable of influencing the protection which could be afforded to his private life ibid the court note that the domestic authority did not explicitly address this point in fact the national radio and television council in it decision made no reference to ac public function but merely referred to the relevant legislative provision which provide the general protection of the right to private life and one right to one own image the supreme administrative court however stated that an exception could be made to the principle of the protection of private life whenever the fact disclosed could give rise to a debate on account of their impact in the light of the status or position of the person concerned see paragraph above although it drew no conclusion from that consideration in so far a broadcasting the impugned video wa concerned nevertheless the court considers that it can be derived from the domestic authority conclusion notably that the news whose source wa the video that had been recorded with a hidden camera could legitimately be broadcast those authority took into account ac public function see von hannover v germany no no september the court therefore concludes that this element wa sufficiently taken into account by the domestic authority when striking a balance between the competing interest a regard the subject of the report the court note that from the party argument a well a from the minute of the hearing that took place before the national radio and television council where the applicant company attorney admitted that the reporter had made use of a hidden camera following their receipt of specific information it follows that the report focused on the behaviour of ac and not on a general discussion of electronic gambling contrast haldimann and others cited above this is corroborated by the fact that all three video were focused on ac and his reaction to the first video which showed him entering a gambling arcade and gambling on electronic machine both the national radio and television council and the supreme administrative court accepted that the report concerning ac behaviour could be legitimately broadcast nevertheless they made a distinction between the news whose source had been the video recorded by hidden camera and the broadcasting of the video themselves the court share the domestic authority position a regard the distinction made between the report on the one hand and the broadcasting of the video on the other hand the court note that it own caselaw acknowledges that the protection of the right and reputation of others take on particular importance in the context of the publication of photograph which may contain very personal or even intimate information see von hannover no cited above and eerikäinen and others cited above the same consideration apply even more so to the broadcasting of video since the audiovisual medium have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print medium see jersild cited above therefore even taking into account the special feature of television there can be no objection to distinguishing between reporting on specific news and the broadcasting of a video see mutatis mutandis mgn limited v the united kingdom cited above verlagsgruppe news gmb h and bobi v austria no december and société de conception de presse et dédition v france no february even though undoubtedly the broadcasting of the video added credibility to the account of event given in the report see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above γ prior conduct of the person concerned the court note that neither the domestic court nor the party commented on ac prior conduct in the circumstance of the case the court considers that the material in the case file is not in itself sufficient to enable it to take cognisance of or examine ac previous conduct with regard to the medium moreover the mere fact that a person ha cooperated with the press on previous occasion can not serve a an argument for depriving that person discussed in an article of all protection see egeland and hanseid v norway no april an individual alleged or real previous tolerance or accommodation with regard to publication touching on his or her private life doe not necessarily deprive that individual of the right to privacy see couderc and hachette filipacchi associés cited above δ circumstance under which the video wa taken method of obtaining the information and it veracity the manner in which the information wa obtained and it veracity are also important factor in this connection the court reiterates that the protection afforded by article of the convention to journalist is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenet of responsible journalism see mutatis mutandis bladet tromsø and stensaas v norway gc cited above fressoz and roire v france gc no echr i kasabova v bulgaria no and april and time newspaper ltd v the united kingdom no and no and echr however the concept of responsible journalism a a professional activity which enjoys the protection of article of the convention is not confined to the content of information which is collected andor disseminated by journalistic mean that concept also embrace inter alia the lawfulness of the conduct of a journalist including his or her public interaction with the authority when exercising journalistic function the fact that a journalist ha breached the law in that connection is a most relevant albeit not decisive consideration when determining whether he or she ha acted responsibly see pentikäinen cited above the court reiterates in this context that journalist who exercise their freedom of expression undertake duty and responsibility see stoll cited above and handyside v the united kingdom december in fine series a no it will be recalled in this connection that paragraph of article doe not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to medium coverage of matter of serious public concern in particular and notwithstanding the vital role played by the medium in a democratic society journalist can not in principle be released from their duty to obey the ordinary criminal law on the basis that a journalist article affords them a castiron defence see among other authority mutatis mutandis stoll cited above bladet tromsø and stensaas cited above and monnat v switzerland no echr x in other word a journalist can not claim exclusive immunity from criminal liability for the sole reason that unlike other individual exercising the right to freedom of expression the offence in question wa committed during the performance of his or her journalistic function see pentikäinen cited above turning to the circumstance of the present case the court observes that both party agreed in substance that the use of a hidden camera wa not absolutely prohibited in domestic law but that it could be accepted subject to strict condition it wa not disputed among the party that pursuant to article of the code on journalistic ethic the use of this technique wa permitted only where there wa an overriding public interest in the dissemination of the relevant information provided that the collection of the information did not violate a person dignity the court ha already established that the report concerned a matter of public interest it considers that what is important at this stage is an assessment of the conduct of the applicant company employee in this connection the court note that in the first video ac wa filmed entering a gambling arcade and playing on electronic gambling machine therefore the applicant company employee recorded the first video in a public space that is to say a place accessible to anyone by contrast the second video wa recorded in unknown premise and showed journalist of the television show projecting the first video to ac a regard the third video the court doe not have in it possession sufficiently detailed knowledge other than that it wa filmed in the host office the court note that the domestic authority assessed the journalist conduct a a whole imposing one sanction on the applicant company for all three video in the court view however there are significant difference between the circumstance under which the first video wa filmed on the one hand and those under which the second and third video were filmed on the other hand without a doubt the use of a hidden camera in this case raise serious issue under the relevant greek legislation in respect of all three video nevertheless the fact that the first video wa filmed in a public space in which anyone could have taken a photograph or a in the instant case filmed a video of the member of the parliament is a factor that should have been taken into consideration by the domestic authority when assessing the journalist conduct the court ha previously considered in case falling under the scope of article albeit in a different context that on occasion when people knowingly or intentionally involve themselves in activity which are or may be recorded or reported in a public manner a person reasonable expectation a to privacy may be a significant although not necessarily conclusive factor see pg and jh v the united kingdom no echr ix on the contrary a regard the second and third video the court considers that in light of the clear position under greek criminal law ac wa entitled to have an expectation of privacy a he entered private space with a view to discussing the recorded incident and for his conversation not to be recorded without his explicit consent in this connection the court considers that the journalist of the applicant company did not act in good faith in their meeting with ac who would have been entitled to feel deceived the court also note that the national radio and television council emphasised that the second and third video were recorded by the journalist with a view to exercising pressure on ac and the applicant company did not adduce any argument to rebut this other than claiming that recording ac with a hidden camera had been necessary a he would never have consented to being filmed in addition a the government pointed out the journalist working in the applicant company breached criminal law and in particular article a of the criminal code which protects the confidentiality of conversation in the court view the journalist of the television show a professional must have been aware of the relevant legislative provision and should have been aware that at that time they were in breach not only of professional ethic but also of criminal law therefore such a breach can only be regarded a deliberate irrespective of the veracity of the relevant information which wa not disputed the court also note that the national radio and television council based it decision on the abovementioned consideration and accordingly sanctioned the applicant company for it use of a hidden camera which resulted in an interference with ac right to his own image from the minute of the meeting it can also be seen that the council attached significant weight to the entrapment of ac see above the same consideration apply to the supreme administrative court which without questioning the legitimacy of broadcasting news whose source had consisted of the impugned video ruled that the applicant company had acted in breach of the code on journalistic ethic which provided for the use of direct and legitimate mean when one exercised the right to impart information compare tierbefreier e v v germany no january the supreme administrative court emphasised the fact that the applicant company had not put forward any argument a to why it had been necessary to broadcast the video that had been filmed without the knowledge and consent of ac in the court view the domestic authority conclusion that the applicant company overstepped the limit of responsible journalism is not unreasonable at least in so far a the second and third video are concerned in this connection the court attache some weight to the fact that the applicant company had already been sanctioned for the same offence in the past however a regard the first video the court considers that the domestic authority failed to take into consideration in their assessment the fact that it wa filmed in a public place an element which in the court view weakens the legitimacy of any expectation of privacy ac might have had when he entered the gambling arcade therefore the present case is distinguishable from haldimann and others v switzerland no echr in which the court ruled that the applicant should have been given the benefit of the doubt a to whether they had intended to act in breach of the ethical rule governing their profession in that case the court took into account the fact that the applicant had taken every measure to protect the broker image by pixellating his image and altering his voice in the present case however it is clear that the applicant company made no effort to compensate for the intrusion into ac private life on the contrary his conduct had been the central subject matter of the video while the conduct of the journalist in the present case suggests that the breach of the code on journalistic ethic and of the criminal code wa deliberate the case is further distinguishable from the case of radio twist a v slovakia no echr xv in which the court ruled that there had been a violation of article after taking into account the fact that it had not been the applicant company or it employee that had been responsible for the recording in question which had been undertaken by illegal mean ibid in the present case however it ha not been disputed by the party that the applicant company employee deployed illegal mean with a view to capturing ac gambling and his reaction to the content of the first videoε content form and consequence of the broadcast a regard the content and form of the broadcast the court note that the first video showed ac entering a gambling arcade and gambling on two machine the second video showed a meeting between ac and associate of the television host of jungle mt during which the first video wa shown to ac the third video concerned a meeting between ac and mt in the latter office the content of the second and third video ha not been described in detail to the court by the party however from the applicant company submission which have not been refuted by the government it appears that in the meeting recorded on those video ac wa shown trying to convince the journalist to present the first video a an experiment connected with his parliamentary duty in exchange he offered to appear live on television in respect of the consequence of the broadcast the court can not help but notice that according to the applicant company the impugned video resulted in ac removal from the parliamentary group of the political party for which he had been elected a deputy in the court view such a consequence can only be regarded a serious and a having directly affected acστ the severity of the sanction lastly the court recall that the nature and severity of any sanction imposed are also factor to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference see among other authority ceylan v turkey gc no echr iv and annen ii v germany dec no and march in this regard the court observes that the national radio and television council took into account the gravity of the offence the number of viewer that had watched the two television show the size of the investment that the applicant company had made and the fact that the applicant company had been repeatedly sanctioned for committing the same offence in the past on the basis of the abovementioned consideration it imposed on the applicant company the relevant sanction namely eur euro in respect of each of the two television show during which the impugned video were broadcast and the obligation to disseminate the content of the decision the supreme administrative court upheld the relevant sanction considering that they were proportionate and that the lack of specific detail regarding the number of viewer or the size of the investment the applicant company had made did not have any impact on the proportionality of the sanction it further took into account the fact that article of law no provided for far stricter penalty including fine a high a eur and the temporary suspension or even the indefinite interruption of the broadcasting of a television show than those imposed on the applicant company the court moreover note that the sanction were imposed on the applicant company and not on the journalist who had made use of the hidden camera or who hosted the television show in view of the above the court accepts that the sanction imposed on the applicant company were relatively lenient though not insignificant and that a number of factor were taken into account when imposing them such a the applicant company past behaviour in relation to similar incident the court also considers that the sanction imposed can not be said to have had a deterrent effect on the press reporting on matter of public interestζ conclusion the court observes that the domestic authority fully recognised that the present case involved a conflict between the right to impart idea and the right of others to protection of their private life and tried to carefully balance the competing right in that respect they attached fundamental importance to the way the information wa obtained and to the journalistic duty and obligation of the applicant company on the basis of the above they imposed the relevant sanction on the applicant company in the court opinion these conclusion can not be considered to be unreasonable or based on a misrepresentation of the relevant fact in so far a the second and third video were concerned despite the somewhat laconic manner in which some of them were expressed the reason put forward by the domestic court in support of their conclusion were in keeping with the principle set forth in the court caselaw in particular the domestic authority acknowledged that the news whose source wa the impugned video had been legitimately disseminated but considered that the video had constituted a substantially more farreaching interference with ac right to his image this conclusion wa in line with the court caselaw according to which even though freedom of expression extends to the publication of photograph this is an area in which the protection of the right of others take on particular importance especially where the image contain very personal and intimate information about an individual or where they are taken on private premise and clandestinely through the use of secret recording device see von hannover cited above hachette filipacchi associés ici paris cited above and mgn limited cited above in view of the above the court concludes that in the circumstance of the present case the reason given by the greek authority were relevant and sufficient to justify the interference in respect of the second and third video the court reiterates that although opinion may differ on the outcome of the judgment where a balancing exercise wa undertaken by the national authority the court would require strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic court see lillo stenberg and sæther v norway no january with reference to axel springer ag and von hannover no both cited above in these circumstance and having regard to the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the domestic court when balancing competing interest the court concludes that there are no strong reason to substitute it view for that of the domestic authority and that there ha accordingly been no violation of article of the convention in respect of the second and third video on the contrary in so far a the first video is concerned the court considers that the domestic authority failed to take into account the circumstance under which it wa obtained despite the fact that it too wa filmed by a hidden camera the court attache great importance to the fact that it wa not recorded in private premise and that the interference with ac right under article wa therefore significantly le serious the court is thus of the opinion that the domestic authority should have included in their assessment the fact that ac by entering a gambling arcade could legitimately have expected his conduct to have been closely monitored and even recorded on camera especially in view of the fact that he wa a public figure having regard to these consideration and despite the margin of appreciation afforded to the domestic authority the court find that in assessing the circumstance submitted for their appreciation they did not strike a reasonable balance of proportionality between the measure restricting the applicant company right to freedom of expression imposed by them and the legitimate aim pursued the court therefore concludes that there ha been a violation of article of the convention in respect of the first video ii alleged violation of article of the convention the applicant company complained that the length of the proceeding before the supreme administrative court had been excessive it relied on article which in it relevant part read a follows in the determination of his civil right and obligation everyone is entitled to a hearing within a reasonable time by a tribunal a admissibility the court note at the outset that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of article a of the convention it further note that it is not inadmissible on any other ground it must therefore be declared admissible b merit the party argument the applicant company maintained that the length of the proceeding before the supreme administrative court had been incompatible with the reasonable time requirement laid down in article of the convention in particular it claimed that the procedure had lasted seven year from the date on which it had lodged the application for annulment and that the fault for the delay had lain with the authority the government contended that the length of the proceeding could not be considered unreasonable in view of the complexity of the case the seriousness of the matter examined and the number of thirdparty interveners it additionally stressed that the case had initially been scheduled to be examined by the fourth section of the supreme administrative court but that owing to it importance and complexity it had been referred to the plenary supreme administrative court the court assessmenta period to take into consideration the period to take into consideration began on april the date on which the applicant company lodged the application for annulment before the supreme administrative court and ended on may when judgment no wa finalised therefore the impugned proceeding have lasted seven year and two monthsb reasonableness of the length of proceeding the court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceeding must be assessed in accordance with wellestablished caselaw in the light of the circumstance of the case and with reference to the following criterion the complexity of the case the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authority and what wa at stake for the applicant in the dispute see among many other authority frydlender v france gc no echr vii lupeni greek catholic parish and others v romania gc no echr extract and vassilios athanasiou and others v greece no december the court ha examined on many occasion case raising question akin to the one in issue here namely the duration of administrative proceeding and concluded that there had been a breach of article vassilios athanasiou and others cited above and the case cited therein even accepting the government argument that the case presented a certain complexity and that it importance led to the fourth section of the supreme administrative court relinquishing the case to the plenary supreme administrative court the court note that the proceeding lasted more than seven year for one instance having regard to it caselaw on the subject the court considers that the government have advanced no fact or argument justifying a different conclusion in the present case therefore in the instant case the length of the proceeding wa excessive accordingly there ha been a breach of article of the convention iii application of article of the convention article of the convention provides if the court find that there ha been a violation of the convention or the protocol thereto and if the internal law of the high contracting party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party a damage the applicant company claimed euro eur in respect of pecuniary damage which wa the level of the fine imposed on it by the national radio and television council in this regard it submitted a certificate drafted by it managing director according to which on march the applicant company paid to the domestic authority the sum of eur however the relevant proof of payment had been destroyed at some point during the year that had elapsed in the meantime it additionally claimed eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage arguing that the excessive length of the domestic proceeding in addition to the sanction imposed on it had been made publicly known and had been covered widely in the press thus damaging it reputation the government considered that in the event that a violation wa found such a finding should constitute sufficient compensation for the applicant company in addition the government contested the causal link between the fine imposed on the applicant company pursuant to the domestic legislation and the alleged violation of article of the convention they further argued that the applicant company could have lodged an application with the domestic court for the reimbursement of the amount they had paid a a fine under article of the introductory law to the civil code governing compensation in case of an illegal act or an omission on the part of the state in any event the government submitted certificate from the relevant fiscal authority attesting to the fact that the applicant company had paid eur and not eur a they had erroneously maintained on the basis of the document in it possession the court accepts that the applicant company paid only eur of the fine imposed in relation to all three video the court further observes that in the present case it ha found a violation of the applicant right guaranteed by article of the convention only in respect of the first video in view of the above the court find that there is a causal link between the violation found and part of the pecuniary damage incurred taking into account the document
