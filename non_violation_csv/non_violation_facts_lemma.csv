lawyer practising in kragujevac the government were represented by their agent m z jadrijević mladar the fact of the case a submitted by the party may be summarised a follows the published article on

age and of romani origin her resistance scream and cry ultimately thwarted the assailant the underaged girl wa warned not to tell anyone what had happened and had to give her telephone number the next day when the head of the municipal branch office called her and arranged to meet her he wa met by the police and arrested he wa also detained for a period of fortyeight hour and then brought before an investigating judge the assailant wa charged with false impersonation unlawful deprivation of liberty and attempted rape the proceeding have commenced and they shall of course have their conclusion the local police otherwise very prompt when it come to informing the public even of much lesser offence simply kept silent about the incident the press also received no information from the investigating judge or the public prosecution service which ha otherwise also been cooperative with respect to providing information concerning it activity this magazine indirectly found out about the horrific ordeal suffered by our underaged fellow citizen the police only provided u with information following receipt of our written request asking them to confirm or deny the detail which we had learnt from others nongovernmental organisation focused on romani right issue also stayed quiet the case of an underaged street vendor wa probably not a priority for their rich donor the city administration likewise did nothing with respect to their own official why did they all remain silent uncomfortable question will soon have to be answered by those in power did the police keep quiet about the attempted rape just because it concerned a romani girl did anyone and if so who from the city administration intervene in order to cover up the shameful incident wa the idea to thereby buy time so a to make it possible for the head of the municipal branch office to strike a deal with the gypsy until they are paid off to withdraw their complaint of attempted rape lastly but most importantly whose interest is it in to protect the bully who is getting his salary paid from the municipal budget while in his free time attempting to rape his underaged fellow citizen for a long a

1,the applicant wa born in and life in weinheim he is a campaigner against abortion and operates an antiabortion website on november and december the applicant distributed leaflet in the immediate vicinity of the medical practice of dr s the leaflet contained inter alia the following text on the front page did you know that dr s full name and address performs abortion that are unlawful according to the caselaw of the federal constitutional court wussten sie schon das dr s abtreibungen durchführt die nach der rechtsprechung de bundesverfassungsgerichts rechtswidrig sind underneath the following wa in smaller type according to international criminal law aggravated murder is the intentional bringingtodeath of an innocent human being sinngemӓβ au den internationalen strafgesetzen mord ist da vorsӓtzliche zu tode bringen eines unschuldigen menschen the back side of the folded leaflet contained the following text the aggravated murder of human being in auschwitz wa unlawful but the morally degraded n state allowed the aggravated murder of innocent people and did not make it subject to criminal liability die ermordung der menschen in auschwitz war rechtswidrig aber der moralisch verkommene nsstaat hatte den mord an den unschuldigen menschen erlaubt und nicht unter strafe gestellt the applicant further quoted part of the federal constitutional court leading judgment of may bverf ge see paragraph below with regard to abortion and a statement by christoph wilhelm hufeland the personal physician of goethe and schiller he also cited section of the conflict in pregnancy act see paragraph below and asked reader to make use of their influence on those performing and assisting in abortion by a letter of december dr s requested that the applicant sign a declaration to cease and desist the applicant refused and published the following statement on his website if dr s full name by carrying out abortion publicly show that he agrees with abortion then he should stand by his opinion instead dr s considers the leaflet campaign to be slander threatens an interim injunction and ha already given his lawyer a mandate to lodge a criminal complaint for defamationslander we ask ourselves is dr s unprincipled and characterless wenn dr s mit der durchführung von abtreibungen öffentlich bekundet das er für abtreibungen ist dann sollte er auch dazu stehen stattdessen sieht dr s in der flugblatt verteilaktion eine rufmordkampagne droht mit einer einstweiligen verfügung und hat bereits seinem rechtsanwalt die vollmacht gegeben eine strafanzeige wegen beleidigung verleumdung zu erwirken wir fragen un ist dr s stand und charakterlos subsequently dr s applied to the karlsruhe regional court for a civil injunction ordering the applicant not to claim on the internet that the plaintiff performed unlawful abortion and not to disseminate leaflet containing his name and the assertion that unlawful abortion were performed in his medical practice he also lodged a claim for nonpecuniary damage in the amount of euro eur and for pretrial legal fee on september the date of the oral hearing before the karlsruhe regional court the applicant distributed a second leaflet directly in front of dr s practice among other place the applicant deposited this second leaflet in which dr s wa not mentioned by name into letterboxes in the immediate vicinity of the latter practice the following sentence wa on the front side of the leaflet near you unlawful abortion and you are silent about the aggravated murder of our child in ihrer nähe rechtswidrige abtreibungen und sie schweigen zum mord an unseren kindern emphasis in original the back of the folded leaflet contained the following text these prenatal infanticide have meanwhile taken on proportion that bring to mind a new holocaust diese vorgeburtlichen kindstötungen haben mittlerweile ausmaße angenommen welche an einen neuen holocaust erinnern emphasis in original farther down the leaflet read im simply unable to understand that medical personnel and doctor who are supposed to help and save life stoop to take part in aggravated murder noch weniger kann ich verstehen das mediziner und ärzte welche helfen und leben retten sollen sich fürs morden hergeben on november the karlsruhe regional court granted the requested injunction and ordered the applicant to desist from asserting publicly both in writing and orally on the internet a well a on leaflet that the plaintiff performed unlawful abortion in his medical practice in addition the regional court awarded compensation for the pecuniary damage requested by the plaintiff eur and dismissed the claim in respect of nonpecuniary damage the court held that the applicant statement were protected by freedom of expression and contributed to a public debate moreover they had to be classified a statement of fact and a such the information that abortion were unlawful wa in line with the judgment of the constitutional court and not incorrect however when read in conjunction with the whole leaflet the statement had a pillory effect and amounted to a serious interference with dr s personality right which wa not justified by the applicant freedom of expression the court came to this conclusion based on the fact that the applicant had singled out dr s by mentioning him by name and distributing the leaflet in the vicinity of his practice that he had quoted the federal constitutional court judgment only in part and had omitted the part that stated that doctor had not been subject to criminal liability that he had implied by defining aggravated murder that dr s had committed this criminal offence and that he had associated dr s with the holocaust nonetheless in regard to nonpecuniary damage the court concluded that even though the attack on dr s reputation had been grave enough to justify the injunction they had not been sufficiently serious to justify nonpecuniary damage the applicant and dr s appealed against the regional court decision additionally dr s expanded his action to include the second leaflet see paragraph above which subsequently became the subject matter of the judgment of the karlsruhe court of appeal on february the karlsruhe court of appeal confirmed the reasoning of the regional court and in essence dismissed both appeal however it partly modified the regional court judgment concerning the precise wording of the requested injunction it ordered the applicant to desist from asserting in public that dr s performed unlawful abortion in his medical practice and asserting in direct connection to this that aggravated murder is the intentional bringingtodeath of an innocent human being the court of appeal further ordered the applicant to desist from asserting that dr s performed unlawful abortion causing infanticide at the outset it emphasised that the applicant view that abortion should be subject to criminal liability and were not compatible with higherranking law fell within the applicant freedom of expression however the court also noted that the very wording of the applicant statement showed that he labelled abortion a performed by the plaintiff aggravated murder which could not be tolerated neither if the statement were considered statement of fact nor if considered value judgment in the court view the applicant had created an unacceptable pillory effect by singling out the plaintiff who had not given the applicant any reason to do so in that regard the court noted that dr s had not been involved in the public debate about abortion in any way in regard to the second leaflet the court of appeal held that even though dr s had not been mentioned by name it had referred to him a it had been distributed in front of his medical practice and deposited in letterboxes in the vicinity similarly to the first leaflet a not negligible part of the reader would have understood from the leaflet that dr s professional activity had constituted aggravated murder however even if understood in a nonlegal sense the leaflet had made it understood that the applicant had conducted illegal and punishable abortion since the applicant had not clarified that he had only been criticising abortion which were according to the caselaw of the federal constitutional court see paragraph below unlawful but not subject to criminal liability he had exceeded the limit of justifiable criticism a to the claim for damage the court of appeal upheld the firstinstance judgment it also did not grant leave to appeal on point of law on may the federal court of justice refused a request by the applicant for legal aid for his complaint against the denial of leave to appeal on point of law on the ground that the applicant intended appeal on point of law lacked sufficient prospect of success on july the federal constitutional court refused to admit a complaint lodged by the applicant for adjudication for being

company on april l brought a civil suit with the harju county court against the applicant company at the hearing of may the representative of the applicant company submitted inter alia that in case like the bronze night public disorder related to the relocation of the bronze soldier monument in april delfi had removed comment per day also on it own initiative by a judgment of june l claim wa dismissed the county court found that the applicant company responsibility wa excluded under the information society service act infoühiskonna teenuse seadus which wa based on the directive on electronic commerce directive ec of the european parliament and of the council of june on certain legal aspect of information society service in particular electronic commerce in the internal market the court considered that the comment environment in the applicant company news portal wa to be distinguished from the portal journalistic area the administration of the former by the applicant company wa essentially of a mechanical and passive nature the applicant company could not be considered the publisher of the comment nor did it have any obligation to monitor them on october the tallinn court of appeal allowed l appeal it considered that the county court had erred in finding that the applicant company responsibility wa excluded under the information society service act the county court judgment wa quashed and the case referred back to the firstinstance court for new consideration on january the supreme court declined to hear the applicant company appeal on june the harju county court having reexamined the case found for l in accordance with the court of appeal instruction it relied on the obligation act võlaõigusseadus and deemed the information society service act inapplicable it observed that the applicant company had placed a note on it internet site that comment were not edited that it wa prohibited to post comment that were contrary to good practice and that the applicant company reserved to itself the right to remove such comment a system wa put in place whereby user could notify the applicant company of any inappropriate comment however the county court considered that this wa insufficient and did not allow adequate protection for the personality right of others the court found that the applicant company itself wa to be considered the publisher of the comment and it could not avoid responsibility by publishing a disclaimer that it wa not liable for the content of the comment the county court found that the news article itself published in the delfi news portal wa a balanced one a number of comment however were vulgar in form they were humiliating and defamatory and impaired l honour dignity and reputation the comment went beyond justified criticism and amounted to simple insult the court concluded that freedom of expression did not extend to protection of the comment concerned and that l personality right had been violated l wa awarded eek eur in nonpecuniary damage on december the tallinn court of appeal upheld the county court judgment it emphasised that the applicant company had not been required to exercise preliminary control over comment posted on it news portal however having chosen not to do so it should have created some other effective system which would have ensured rapid removal of unlawful comment from the portal the court of appeal considered that the measure taken by the applicant company were insufficient and that it wa contrary to the principle of good faith to place the burden of monitoring the comment on their potential victim the court of appeal rejected the applicant company argument that it responsibility wa excluded on the basis of the information society service act it noted that the applicant company wa not a technical intermediary in respect of the comment and that it activity wa not of a merely technical automatic and passive nature instead it invited user to add comment thus the applicant company wa a provider of content service rather than of technical service on june the supreme court dismissed the applicant company appeal it upheld the court of appeal judgment in substance but partly modified it reasoning the supreme court approved the lower court interpretation of the information society service act and reiterated that an information society service provider falling under that act and the directive on electronic commerce had neither knowledge of nor control over information which wa transmitted or stored by contrast a provider of content service governed the content of information that wa being stored in the present case the applicant company had integrated the comment environment into it news portal and invited user to post comment the number of comment had an effect on the number of visit to the portal and on the applicant company revenue from advertisement published on the portal thus the applicant company had an economic interest in the comment the fact that the applicant company did not write the comment itself did not imply that it had no control over the comment environment it enacted the rule of comment and removed comment if the rule were breached the user on the contrary could not change or delete the comment they had posted they could merely report obscene comment thus the applicant company could determine which comment were published and which not the fact that it made no use of this possibility did not mean that it had no control over the publishing of the comment furthermore the supreme court considered that in the present case both the applicant company and the author of the comment were to be considered publisher of the comment in this context it also referred to the economic interest of an internet portal administrator which made it a publisher a entrepreneur similarly to a publisher of printed medium the supreme court found that the plaintiff wa free to choose against whom to bring the suit and l had chosen to bring the suit against the applicant company the supreme court found that on the basis of it legal obligation to avoid causing damage to other person the applicant company should have prevented clearly unlawful comment from being published furthermore after the comment had been published it had failed to remove them on it own initiative although it must have been aware of their unlawfulness the court had rightly found that the applicant company failure to act had been unlawful d subsequent development according to information posted on october by delfi on it internet portal delfi did not allow person who had posted offensive comment to post a new comment until the commenter had read and accepted the rule of commenting furthermore it wa announced that delfi had set up a team of moderator who carried out followup moderation of comment posted on the portal first of all the moderator reviewed all user notice of inappropriate comment the compliance of comment with the rule of commenting wa monitored a well according to the information published the number of comment posted by delfis reader in august had been delfis moderator had

rm and his alleged relationship with a prominent azerbaijani poet bakhtiyar vahabzade bv and the exhead of the executive authority in sheki ashraf mammadov am wa published in khural the title of the article wa ramiz mehdiyevs plan to finish bakhtiyar vahabzade why did the head of the presidential administration have to punish the sheki community and the head of it executive authority relevant extract from the article appear in paragraph below mr elchin ugurtaj wa mentioned a the author of the article from the material submitted to the court it is not clear whether the name in question wa that of a real person or a pen name in june rm lodged a civil action against the first applicant with the narimanov district court arguing that the abovementioned article contained false statement damaging his honour dignity and professional reputation rm asked the court to order the first applicant to issue an apology and refutation and to pay azerbaijani manat azn for nonpecuniary damage to be transferred to an orphanage rm argued in particular that the title of the impugned article and certain extract from it were defamatory the extract concerned read a followsi in fact the incident described in an article called mafia and the press published in gundam khabar happened not in one of the district of baku but in sheki the one who wa gravely insulted wa not some ordinary man but bakhtiyar vahabzade a famous azerbaijani poet yes the exhead of executive authority in sheki ashraf mammadov wa given an order by ramiz mehdiyev not to allow bakhtiyar vahabzade being elected and that wa a part of a very serious plan in that manner mehdiyev wanted to gain revenge on bakhtiyar vahabzade who hated him for many yearsii ashraf mammadovs black day began after he had refused to obey ramiz mehdiyevs order no one would forget the wellknown event that had happened in sheki during the parliamentary election yes indeed all of that wa a scheme and both the sheki community and ashraf mammadov had to be punished because ramiz mehdiyev failed to implement his big plan the plan to crush bakhtiyar vahabzade in sheki that is why revenge had to be takeniii it is rumoured that the late president heydar aliyev did not allow the central election commission to annul bakhtiyar vahabzades deputy mandate and thus proved to mehdiyev who had the last word a it is also rumoured that mehdiyev had taken on such initiativeiv bakhtiyar vahabzade became an enemy of ramiz mehdiyev and the latter played the key role in the machine importing harmful idea to azerbaijan and it is now clear that the only reason why bakhtiyar vahabzade wa targeted wa that he wa a turkic nationalist mehdiyev not only insulted bakhtiyar vahabzade but also plotted conspiracy theory against him but none of that

had prevented memorialising bv after the latter death furthermore the court noted that those allegation were statement affecting rms reputation and lacking any factual basis that the first applicant had failed to submit any evidence proving those allegation against rm and that the article in question constituted an abuse of the right to freedom of expression the firstinstance court ordered the first applicant to issue an apology and refutation the first applicant wa also ordered to pay azn which at the material time wa equivalent to approximately euro eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage to be transferred to an orphanage a requested by the plaintiff the first applicant appealed arguing that by publishing the article in question it had performed it role of public watchdog reporting on topic of high public interest that rm who wa a wellknown highranking government official should have displayed a greater degree of tolerance of criticism against him that the statement made in the article constituted value judgment and therefore were not susceptible of proof and that the article merely reproduced and commented on information which had been published earlier in gundam khabar

informer who supplied the information on the basis of which the whole matter wa disseminated and today a far a we know they are being paid for that i do not yet know how much some or of the amount obtained following this statement a journalist from the daily super express jh commented i am the author of this article jh from super express my question concern the people who inspired me maybe you could tell u something else about these familialfinancial relationship the applicant replied i will reply to you the first complaint will be lodged against you with the court tomorrow after that three more complaint will be lodged on october the rzeczpospolita daily published an article entitled jan bestry i did not commit rape i will sue super express according to this article the super express daily had written that in the s the applicant employment contract had been terminated without notice because he had sexually abused young girl the article went on to say that a few day after publication of this story the tv station tvn reported that the applicant had been convicted in of having assaulted a woman passenger on a train when working a a train conductor the article also

wrote it after interviewing the applicant on the phone according to gp the applicant approved publication of the content of the article and the statement cited in the article were the statement made by the applicant however the applicant denied having spoken to gp or having approved any information for publication in the press article when questioned by the court he said that he had not attempted to have a correction of this article published because he had only found out about it in the course of the judicial proceeding see paragraph below b civil proceeding against the applicant on december the former editorinchief of the super express daily tl and the publisher of the newspaper the company medium express sp z oo lodged a civil claim against the applicant for the protection of their personal right they claimed that the applicant had harmed their good name and credibility by statement he had made at the press conference on october and in the article published by rzeczpospolita on october on may the warsaw regional court granted the claim in part and ordered the applicant to publish an apology for the statement he had made and which were cited in the article published by

press article which appeared over the following day concerning the subject matter discussed at the conference the court dismissed the remainder of the claim finding that the statement made by the applicant at the press conference on october could not unambiguously be interpreted a concerning journalist from a specific newspaper because the applicant had not expressly mentioned any journalist or newspaper by name both party appealed against the firstinstance judgment on february the warsaw court of appeal amended the challenged judgment insofar a it additionally ordered the applicant to publish an apology for the statement made during the press conference on october the court examined what wa said in the course of the conference and found that the applicant had initially referred to

practice of dr st who performed abortion there the leaflet stated inter alia that the abortion performed by dr st in his practice for which he gave the address were unlawful according to the caselaw of the federal constitutional court in addition the leaflet contained the following statement according to international criminal law aggravated murder is the intentional bringingtodeath of an innocent human being sinngemӓβ au den internationalen strafgesetzen mord ist da vorsӓtzliche zu tode bringen eines unschuldigen menschen the murder of human being in auschwitz wa unlawful but the morally degraded n state allowed the murder of innocent people and did not make it subject to criminal liability die ermordung der menschen in auschwitz war rechtswidrig aber der moralisch verkommene

in conversation about abortion dr st lodged an application for a civil injunction against the applicant and on october the mannheim regional court granted the requested injunction the court ordered the applicant to desist from speaking to passersby in the immediate vicinity of the medical practice and labelling the abortion performed by the plaintiff unlawful with the objective of irritating female patient and preventing them from visiting dr sts practice on february the karlsruhe court of appeal upheld the decision and slightly modified the wording specifying the geographical area concerned by the injunction it also refused to grant leave to appeal on point of law the regional court a well a the court of appeal both referred to a previous decision of the federal court of justice in which it had confirmed a civil injunction against similar conduct by the applicant see paragraph below the court held that in the case at issue there were no factual or legal difference justifying deviating from the caselaw of the federal court of justice in so far that the doctor in the present case wa slightly more wellknown than the doctor in the original case the court of appeal held that this wa of minor relevance the fact that dr st had appeared a an expert before the german parliament many year previously did not have any substantial effect on dr sts public profile at that time moreover the involvement of dr st in different legal dispute wa irrelevant a trying to enforce his right in the appropriate legal procedure could not redound to dr sts disadvantage in sum the applicant had vilified the noncriminal professional activity of dr st by implying that he committed criminal act and interfered with the relationship of trust between doctor and patient which deserved special protection against the intervention of others the applicant had therefore severely interfered with dr sts personality right this interference wa not justified by the applicant freedom of

emphasised the important role which the legislature had attributed to gynaecologist both in the protection of unborn life and in the protection of the health of the woman concerned it wa essential that the relationship of trust between the doctor and his patient wa not disturbed by the intrusion of external party the applicant action had adversely affected the plaintiff activity in an

7,in and life in zagreb he wa represented by mr v drenški lasan a lawyer practising in zagreb the government were represented by their agent mr š stažnik the fact of the case a submitted by the party may be summarised a follows on june the applicant a retired politician who had previously held high political function in the country lodged a request with the croatian state archive hrvatski državni arhiv hereinafter the state archive to be granted access to fiftysix document that formed part of the archival collection of the office of the president of the republic of croatia for the period between and the applicant stated that he needed those record in order to write a documentary history of the founding of the croatian state given that the document in question were classified a state secret strictly confidential for a period of thirty year the state archive requested the office of the president of the republic of croatia a the owner of those document to decide on whether or not they should be declassified prior to taking a decision the office of the president requested the opinion of the office of the national security council ured vijeća za nacionalnu sigurnost hereinafter the national security council the national security council examined the applicant request and the content of the requested record and concluded that owing to the nature of the content of certain record the need to safeguard the value for which those document had been declared secret in the first place namely the independence integrity and national security of the republic of croatia and it foreign relation still prevailed the disclosure of the said document would in the opinion of the office of the national security council cause harm to the value protected under section of the data secrecy act see paragraph below subsequently on august the office of the president declassified thirtyone of the requested document but declined to declassify the remaining twentyfive document the document that remained secret were transcript from certain session held in and by the defence and national security council of which the applicant had been a member an advisory body to the president of the republic which at the material time had examined strategic issue of state policy and national security and had coordinated the activity of the highest state body and institution certain record of meeting between the then president of croatia and senior foreign official and croatian official were also left classified by the office of the president in the reasoning for it decision not to declassify the latter document the office of the president held a follows having taken into account the request submitted by the applicant a well a the content of specific record the office of the national security council wa of the opinion that owing to the content of certain record transcript the need to protect the value in defence of which those record had originally been classified independence the integrity and security of the republic of croatia and the foreign relation of the republic of croatia still prevailed therefore those individual record transcript should not be declassified accordingly the office of the national security council deemed that the document listed in this decision contained information the disclosure of which might potentially jeopardise the value listed in section of the data secrecy act in view of the above and given that under section of the data secrecy act the opinion of the office of the national security council is not binding but the owner of the information ha the exclusive authority to ultimately decide whether the classification of certain data is to remain or be changed or if that data is to be declassified it ha been established that declassifying some of the requested document might cause irreparable harm to the value listed in section of the data secrecy act and that the protection of those value prevails over the interest of the public which is why the degree of classification of the document listed in this decision is maintained following the decision of the office of the president on september the state archive refused the applicant request for the declassification of the abovementioned twentyfive record which remained top secret and granted his request to be allowed early access to archival material from that collection with respect to the thirtyone record that had been declassified by the president decision on september the applicant lodged an appeal with the information commissioner alleging inter alia that the contested ruling had been arbitrary unfair and devoid of any clear criterion because he had been granted access to transcript of certain meeting but not to other conversation between the same person on july the information commissioner dismissed the applicant appeal for the purpose of the appeal proceeding she directly inspected the document in question and ultimately accepted the conclusion that their declassification may harm national security and foreign relation noting in addition that the applicant had failed to provide argument in his appeal a to why those document should have been declassified or why his interest in accessing the information outweighed the public interest in protecting the aim at stake the information commissioner also stated that under the relevant domestic law and practice only the owner of the document in issue in this case the office of the president of the republic had the power to alter the classification level of confidential information and that the procedure followed by that body had been lawful on september the applicant brought an action for judicial review in the high administrative court of the republic of croatia visoki upravni sud republike hrvatske seeking to have quashed the information commissioner ruling which in his view did not contain any reasoning in respect of why certain record had been declassified while others had not in her reply the information commissioner stressed that only the owner of the document in question had the power to declassify them on october the high administrative court dismissed the applicant action it found that the applicant had not contested the fact but only the application of the law that the information commissioner had acted lawfully when she had dismissed his appeal and that she had provided clear and valid reasoning for her decision it held that in the case at hand the owner of the information and the body with the power to classify but also to declassify it is the president of the republic when there is a public interest in the disclosure of such information it owner is under an obligation to ass the proportionality between the right of access to information and the protection of the value listed in section and of the data secrecy act and to decide whether to maintain the degree of classification amend it or declassify the information at issue however before reaching it decision the owner of the information must request the opinion of the office of the national security council in line with section of the data secrecy act it can be seen from the case file that following the applicant request the prescribed procedure wa followed given that the firstinstance public authority requested the declassification of the document in question by the owner of the information which after obtaining the opinion of the office of the national security council decided not to declassify them that being so the state archive wa not authorised to provide the requested information on appeal the information commissioner inspected the opinion of the office of the national security council which stated that owing to the content of certain document transcript the need to protect the value in defence of which those record had originally been classified the independence integrity and security of the republic of croatia and it foreign relation still prevailed and gave the opinion that declassifying certain document could cause damage to the value listed in section of the data secrecy act given that under section of the data secrecy act the owner of classified information ha the exclusive power to decide whether to maintain alter the level of the classification or declassify the information in question in the opinion of this court the state archive respected the prescribed procedure and in accordance with the opinion of the office of the national security council and the decision of the owner of the information lawfully rejected the request of the applicant for access to the information in question and the information commissioner on appeal correctly established that in the present case the protection of the value listed in section of the data secrecy act prevailed over the public interest in the publishing of the protected information and that the decision of the owner of the information had been rendered following a lawful procedure therefore in view of the cited legal provision on which the information commissioner decision is based a well a the fact established in the proceeding this court find that the information commissioner correctly dismissed the applicant appeal against the state archive decision and that it provided clear and valid reason for that decision which is entirely upheld by this court the objection of the applicant that the refusal of his request wa not sufficiently reasoned is therefore illfounded and his objection relating to voluntarism voluntarizam in disclosing the requested information is not proven and in light of the lawful procedure in the present case and the discretionary power of the owner of the information a regard declassification of classified information ha no bearing on a different outcome of the present case on december the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court ustavni sud republike hrvatske complaining inter alia of a breach of his right to a fair trial and of his right of access to information on march the constitutional court sitting a a bench of twelve judge dismissed the applicant constitutional complaint having concluded that there had been an interference with the applicant right of access to information because his academic work had been a matter of public interest and that the interference had been lawful the constitutional court held a follows a regard the legitimate aim the constitutional court point out that the impugned judgment in addition to relying on section of the data secrecy act and section of the access to information act stated that the opinion of the office of the national security council had been obtained the constitutional court considers that a more detailed specification of the legitimate reason for the denial of access to the information sought in the specific circumstance of the present case namely upholding the interest of the state in the area of independence integrity national security and the international relation of the republic of croatia would constitute a problem amounting to the disclosure of that protected information to the extent that the legitimate reason for denying access to the information sought have been specified in the present case see subsection of section above the constitutional court considers that the said interference wa necessary in a free and democratic society and proportionate to the nature of the need the constitutional court ha already explained it previously stated opinion mutatis mutandis in it decision no uiii three judge of the constitutional court dissented in the dissenting opinion of two of them judge lk and g stated a follows firstly the applicant right to effective legal protection ha been limited in the course of the administrative proceeding by the president of the republic of croatia a the firstinstance administrative authority a well a by the information commissioner and the administrative court in the case at hand the violation of the constitutional right to effective legal protection is twofold on the one hand the violation occurred because the refusal to grant access to the document in question by the president wa not sufficiently reasoned on the other hand the applicant right wa violated because the information commissioner and the administrative court failed to fulfil their supervisory function and refused to examine the substantive content justification for the assessment of the need to deny access a precisely defined goal the manner in which the protected aim wa jeopardised the scope of any possible damage the risk of such damage occurring but instead limited their assessment to a mere review of the formal reason given the citing of legal provision a review of the relevant deadline and on the inclusion of advisory body secondly we consider that there ha been a violation of the applicant constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression the applicant sought access to a certain number of presidential record with a view to conducting research and analysis for a book covering political event that occurred during the period of croatian history that the record in question concern the denial of access to those record can not be contested if there indeed is a reason on the basis of which it could be concluded that their publication would cause irreparable harm to the national security integrity and independence of the republic of croatia however the applicant and the public do not know whether their publication would indeed have such an effect because they have been prevented from knowing whether an assessment ha been conducted at all and if so whether it wa sufficiently serious and rigorous the applicant is supposed to trust the state authority without having had a chance to question their assessment or to provide counterargument this ha effectively defied the point of the constitutional right to freedom of expression a one of the constitutional form of protection from arbitrary abuse of the power afforded to the authority without being given any real opportunity to question the substance of the assessment of the existence of any risk of irreparable harm to the interest of the republic of croatia the applicant ha been denied his right to effective legal protection of his constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression therefore in the present case the violation of the constitutional guarantee of effective legal protection in administrative proceeding at the same time constitutes a breach of the constitutional freedom of expression in it procedural aspect the president of the republic certainly ha the authority to deny access to presidential record however that authority is not absolute it is subject to an assessment of the risk of irreparable harm being done to the national interest of the republic of croatia the president adopted the decision in the present case in the form of an administrative decision which therefore ha to be reasoned the sufficiency of that reasoning is to be assessed in each individual case on the basis of the specific circumstance of the case the president is not obliged to state the reason which may jeopardise the aim of classifying the document in question but merely stating that the president ha the authority to deny access in order to protect secrecy she requested the opinion of the council she received the opinion whereby the national security council express it view that it is necessary to maintain the existing secrecy classification and she agreed with that opinion with the aim of protecting the interest of the national security integrity and independence of the republic of croatia and it international reputation doe not satisfy the requirement of sufficiency first of all such reasoning doe not indicate that a proportionality test wa indeed conducted citizen are requested to simply assume that the president of the republic conducted a proportionality test a required by the data secrecy act although on the basis of such reasoning it is possible to doubt whether the decision ha been adopted a a result of somebody subjective impression that the requested document should not become public just to be on the safe side we do not question that in case such a the present one it is quite possible for the authority from which access to classified information is being requested will not have at it disposal many fact which it might otherwise be able to refer to in it reasoning a evidence that it decision to refuse a request for declassification is justified without jeopardising the purpose of the classification by the publication thereof however such reasoning can not boil down to stating general aim which the denial of access is supposed to protect such a the independence integrity or safety of the republic of croatia or of it international relation reasoning that doe not indicate more specifically the reason for arguing that the publication of the requested information might jeopardise what are in essence the highest interest of the republic of croatia doe not support the assumption that a proportionality test ha actually been conducted a proportionality test requires the public authority to examine the adequacy of the impugned measure and it necessity it is not possible to achieve either of those if the goal of the measure in question is set hypothetically and in the abstract this is particularly applicable under the circumstance of the present case indeed despite exerting one best attempt it is not easy to understand the reason that would justify the assumption that the publication of conversation that took place almost a quarter of a century ago between two statesman who died many year ago about a historical period and event concerning which in the interim much ha been discovered could jeopardise the integrity of the republic of croatia today moreover were these hypothetical and abstract reason to constitute sufficient reason to deny access to record concerning event of such a nature then they would be sufficient to justify any act of public authority that limit the fundamental right and freedom of citizen the applicant attorney received the constitutional court decision on april on february in an interview given to a daily newspaper the applicant stated that he had finished writing his book and that it would be published in a few month he also stated that should the strasbourg court find a violation of his right and

8,the applicant wa born in and life in sant angelo in campo lucca a the applicant circular letter in the applicant wa practising law in september he sent a letter to the italian national legal service commission consiglio superiore della magistratura the csm in which he complained about the conduct of a judge x at the lucca district court he subsequently transmitted the content of that letter by mean of a circular letter to a number of judge of the same court but without expressly referring to x by name the relevant part of that circular letter read a follows before you receive any incorrect or untrue information before the corporatist spirit prevails over a correct interpretation of the reason that drove me to write to the csm to the ministry of justice to the national council of notary and to the national bar council about the conduct of two judge of the lucca district court in the context of a judicial partition procedure to which my client were party and before any of my colleague come to apologise on my behalf for my initiative perhaps making out that i am insane or irresponsible my intention is to clarify and tell you the reason which led me to do so an appeal on point of law is pending against a judgment of the lucca district court in which that court ruling against the claim by a female partner and deciding on the related issue of the partition of an inheritance asked the investigating judge to proceed with the sale of a flat which wa the sole item of property to be divided between the heir and which wa occupied by the partner and her daughter an heir born to the cohabiting couple since the judgment of the lucca district court wa not final it wa not possible to proceed with the sale or to initiate the procedure relating thereto since this wa prohibited expressly by article of the code of civil procedure the other heir however applied for the sale and the investigating judge in spite of our repeated request for suspension of the sale which were all rejected brought about after two auction without a buyer the conveyance of the property to a third party at the third auction here are the specific reason for which all our request were rejected in spite of this i would like to point out at the outset that i do not feel any animosity towards the judiciary and judge in general and that i consider by contrast that the role played by judge is crucial and irreplaceable for civil society there are and have been judge who carry out and have carried out their duty with great dignity and decorum decoro and who deserve my admiration and the admiration of all those who have worked in the field of justice none of u can forget y who died one can say on the battlefield i still remember that in the courtroom he wa the one out of all his colleague who even in his state of extreme and obvious suffering took the greatest number case for adjudication and he carried on doing this until the bitter end i confess that if i had been able to spare him the effort in view of his condition i would willingly have taken over his workload but there are other equally deserving judge who work even during their holiday going to the office talking to lawyer and with whom we can have a form of collaboration and dialogue and to them i also express my esteem and admiration i am well aware that justice is done by men and precisely for that reason decision may be erroneous and incomplete i still prefer however a human justice to one that is automated but what i refuse to accept is the idea that when the right of the individual and the dignity of those whose task it is to defend him or her are at stake those right could be decided upon in a partial manner perhaps with a display of arrogance or that a ruling could be given with total indifference and lack of commitment i personally believe strongly in the autonomy of the judiciary and i feel that without respect for the autonomy of the person whose task it is to decide it would be impossible to have dispassionate and fair judgment autonomy however can not be turned into an absolute discretionary power because that would be bordering on or tantamount to arbitrariness i have pointed out how i see the meaning of justice and reiterate that i think very highly of the duty exercised by judge and that my full admiration go to those who act with dedication commitment and decorum decoro i am even envious of judge because they probably have more time to study and to dwell on issue and also to attend to other cultural and social interest than lawyer who by the nature and specificity of their work do not always manage to do thing or to do thing well i often take home thing to read and to study and i end up midevening nodding off over a book after a busy day running from one office to another in the morning and answering the phone or receiving client in the afternoon i also understand that the judiciary is burdened with work and with problem that the staffing is insufficient and the workload huge and for that reason it is true that protest esposti do not help to get the work done more easily and that more collaboration and dialogue would be better than protest there are limit however that in my view should not be passed and after thinking about this for quite some time i decided to submit this particular protest the letter to the csm i will now quote the last part of my protest in which i dwell on the meaning of the lawyer profession and ask whether it is legitimate that any decision or conduct should always be accepted this lawyer would point out a follows it is regrettable to direct this letter against individual who even if they have different duty are considered by this lawyer to be colleague a practitioner in law usually call each other he considers however that he is obliged to do so in response to a lack of commitment and total indifference towards the legitimate demand of the citizen in whose name justice is done with a belief in impunity a the position is one of power even though it should be seen a the discharge of a duty and last but not least a lack of respect for the dignity and responsibility of this lawyer profession this lawyer ha practised law in court at three level of jurisdiction ha borne very high cost on behalf of his client to the point where if one were to apply the professional rate one would exceed the amount of the claim ha sought in three statement of claim filed in the florence court of appeal a stay of execution under article of the code of civil procedure but his request were all rejected by reasoning that leaf much to be desired but that is not the subject of this protest ha accumulated a formidable pile of document of all description and ha seen the attachment of fund in respect of his own claim go up in smoke in the time it ha taken to work on these case he could probably have dealt with fifteen ordinary case of average complexity if work any type of work provided it is lawful ha it own protection and it own dignity then the judge too more than any person a a result of his function and role can not but allow himself not to respect for the work of others including that of the lawyer a a legal practitioner this lawyer ha a duty to provide some certainty to his client who is the citizen in whose name justice is done judgment are headed in the name of the italian people what certainty can the lawyer provide if each judge instead of applying the law give his preferred interpretation and doe not even explain his interpretation of the law in question it should be noted that the system of appeal and claim is no guarantee for the citizen judge are only human and can make mistake errare humanum est but they can not and must not wilfully make mistake by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence and the citizen must have his or her claim upheld provided they are well founded from the earliest stage there are a large number of case this can be explained by the fact that if many decision had been taken correctly from the outset one could have avoided the proliferation of case procedure and claim a can be seen here and not forgetting the many case where the citizen disappointed and bemused to receive abnormal decision having lost all confidence in the justice system decides not to appeal this entail a justified loss of confidence in the court and an increase in workload and expense for the state because of the extra work for other judge registry and bailiff and what justification and explanation could be given by the lawyer to this client to whom he had predicted a certain result with all due caution only to present a decision by the judge that is diametrically opposed to that which he predicted if that is the result of an error or a lack of knowledge or commitment or analysis on the part of the lawyer he should take responsibility for it but when this depends on the judge it is damaging to the lawyer because the client will necessarily have a negative opinion of the lawyer work are client and citizen capable of understanding whether it is the lawyer or the judge who ha made a mistake and to what extent if the lawyer doe not obtain appropriate result with legal argument what other mean are available what must the lawyer do to obtain something to which he is professionally entitled or should the lawyer not make life difficult for himself and carry on regardless tending to his garden il suo orticello while protecting his head from any tile that might fall off the roof because on the one hand he is not protected and on the other he is at the mercy of another person discretionary power without any regard for his own professional dignity when this letter reach you i will be undergoing a medical operation i am sorry that for the time being i can not provide any further clarification or explanation to those who may wish them i am however ready if necessary to answer for my conduct and to provide any clarification that may be requested of me after my operation when i am in a better state of health again b firstinstance proceeding finding that certain expression used in the circular letter had impugned his reputation x filed a criminal complaint for defamation against the applicant a x wa a judge in lucca the file wa transferred under article of the code of criminal procedure to the judicial authority of genoa on february the genoa public prosecutor requested that the applicant be committed to stand trial before the court of that city x joined the criminal proceeding against the applicant a a civil party according to the charge in the circular letter the applicant had expressed admissible lecite criticism in so far a he spoke about interpreting and performing the work of a judge but had then overstepped the limit to his freedom of expression by writing the following sentence in particulara autonomy can not be turned into an absolute discretionary power because that would be bordering on or tantamount to arbitrarinessb in a partial manner perhaps with a display of arrogance or a ruling given with total indifference and lack of commitmentc the judge can not allow himself not to respect the work of others including that of the lawyerd judge are only human and can make mistake but they can not and must not wilfully make mistake by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence at the hearing of march the representative of the public prosecutor office stated that the applicant also had to be charged with proffering insult given that it transpired from x statement that he had been one of the recipient of the circular letter in a judgment of february deposited in the court registry on february the genoa district court convicted the applicant of defamation and proffering insult and sentenced him to four month imprisonment and to the reimbursement of x court cost amounting to euro eur with reparation for the damage sustained by x the amount of that damage wa to be fixed in separate civil proceeding the court nevertheless awarded x an advance payment provisionale of eur the district court observed that it wa not in dispute that the applicant had written the circular letter and had asked his secretary to send copy to the judge in the civil division of the lucca district court during the proceeding the applicant had filed pleading and had made spontaneous statement his argument in defence had not however made it possible to disregard the offensive nature of the expression used in the circular letter exacerbated by the fact that he wa a lawyer in his letter the applicant had stated that he had the greatest respect for the judiciary and for judge who carried out their duty with dedication commitment and decorum but he wa clearly not talking here about x who had been accused by the applicant of being arrogant and indifferent of believing that he wa immune because he held a position of power and of having committed wilful mistake by malicious intent serious misconduct or negligence those accusation could be explained not by x inaction in the handling of a case but by the decision taken by x in a case where the applicant request had been rejected instead of reiterating his legal argument the applicant had overstepped the limit of his right to criticism alleging that x had erred wilfully thus seriously impugning the honour of the judge in question according to the district court the subject of the accusation contained in the circular letter could only have been x a shown by similar letter which expressly referred to that judge addressed by the applicant and his client to the csm the ministry of justice the national council of notary and the national bar council the applicant defence esimente of provocation article of the criminal code wa not accepted even supposing that the decision of x could be regarded a unfair act the circular letter sent about four month after those decision did not constitute an immediate reaction to them c court of appeal proceeding the applicant lodged an appeal he alleged among other thing that the offence he wa said to have committed were punishable merely by a fine that the sentence imposed on him had been disproportionate and that the advance he had to pay wa excessive moreover in his complaint x had not mentioned that he himself had been a recipient of the circular letter thus ruling out the charge of proffering insult the applicant also argued that it could not be seen from the text of the letter that the criticism wa directed at x and that this document when assessed a a whole wa merely a manifestation of his frustration about the shortcoming of the justice system in general lastly in the alternative he took the view that his defence of provocation wa valid he argued that in the proceeding for the partition of an inheritance x had on a number of occasion rejected his request for the suspension of a sale by auction of the flat in question and that x decision had subsequently been overturned by another judge at the hearing of march the applicant stated that it had not been his intention to offend x personally and he produced document a evidence of his illhealth in a judgment of the same day deposited in the court registry on april the genoa court of appeal ruled that no prosecution could be brought on a charge of proffering insult a there had been no criminal complaint on that ground and reduced the sentence for the offence of defamation to a fine of eur it stated that this sentence wa fully remitted condonata and ordered the applicant to make reparation for the damage sustained by x which it assessed at eur and to reimburse x court cost in the appeal proceeding eur the court of appeal observed that in the first part of his circular letter the applicant had recounted the tribulation of the partition proceeding in which x had taken the impugned decision he had added that he regretted having to make complaint about certain individual x and another judge whom even though they had different duty from his own he regarded a colleague in addition the judge of the lucca district court giving testimony in the firstinstance proceeding had had no difficulty in identifying x a the addressee of the criticism in the circular letter in those circumstance the applicant argument that the letter wa merely a manifestation of his discontent about the justice system in general could not be accepted in the court of appeal view the decision taken by x in the context of the inheritance partition proceeding could at most be regarded a erroneous but not a unfair the court also pointed out that one of the question at the heart of the dispute the existence of inheritance right in favour of the partner had been settled by the court of cassation differently from the applicant proposed solution the national bar council had in fact noted that the applicant letter could have been seen a a mean of pressure against the judge concerned according to the court of appeal the applicant had not expressly challenged the part of the firstinstance judgment considering that the expression contained in the circular letter had overstepped the limit of the right to criticise the applicant who had no criminal record had to be allowed the benefit of mitigating circumstance and under article of legislative decree no of see paragraph below the penalty for defamation wa now a mere fine and not a custodial sentence the court of appeal observed that the distribution of a letter such a that sent by the applicant within a small court could not but impugn the dignity of the judge against whom it wa directed and his image a an independent judge the expression used by the applicant outside any procedural act sought to call into question the professional conduct of x who wa portrayed within a restricted community a a partial and soft judge in the light of those consideration the court of appeal ruling on an equitable basis awarded the civil party eur in nonpecuniary damage d appeal on point of law the applicant appealed on point of law he reiterated his grievance and referring to a particular passage in his ground of appeal stated that the court of appeal had made a mistake in asserting that the defendant had failed to challenge the finding about the offensive nature of the expression contained in the circular letter in any event the judge had been required at all stage of the proceeding to verify of his own motion whether or not the criminal charge in question wa made out in a judgment of november deposited in the court registry on december the court of cassation finding that the court of appeal had given logical and correct reasoning in respect of all the contentious point dismissed the applicant appeal on point of law ii relevant domestic law article of the criminal code provides for the offence of defamation the relevant part of that article read a follows anyone who in

mr p accomplishment in that field mr p wa further quoted a saying that the allotted fund were insufficient to finance the work of the project organising committee and a criticising local business for their unwillingness to sponsor the project allegedly because the project had not received the governor explicit endorsement the article then went on a follows curiously enough just before that meeting i had a chance to talk to some businessmen i know they told me that the chief federal inspector office had literally pestered them with offer for them to become sponsor however they do not respond to such offer not because they fear the governor but because they do not want to give money some say that mr p is too deeply involved in political game of which they want no part others are for some

referring to mr p on september the leninskiy district court of kirov granted mr p claim against the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper in full the court found that the final paragraph of the article contained false information about the plaintiff who it had falsely alleged wa the collector of fund that might have been wasted on lover rather than spent on cultural event the court

the same day the first applicant applied to the leninskiy district court for a stay in the enforcement proceeding it submitted that the court had ordered the enforcement of the judgment against the

unlawful and violated the first applicant right to know the reason for the judgment at that time the full text of the judgment wa unavailable and to lodge an appeal against it on september judge s issued two interim decision by the first decision he refused the first applicant request for a stay of enforcement a unsubstantiated no further reason were given the second decision rectified an error

vesti newspaper on september the gubernskie vesti kirov newspaper published the retraction statement a drafted by mr p and endorsed in the judgment of september on september the first applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment of september submitting that the article had not named the collector of fund for the project or suggested that it wa mr p who had collected the fund nor had it stated that mr p had lover or that he had embezzled any fund entrusted to him it wa clear from the text that the contested sentence did not concern mr p at all the first applicant further complained about the district court unreasoned refusal to adjourn the hearing until the second applicant had returned from leave the second applicant wa the only person who knew the identity of the author of the article and who wa able to give an informed response to the statement of claim the second applicant lodged a statement in support of the appeal he disclosed that he wa the author of the article and stated that the judgment of september had been poorly reasoned although mr p had failed to prove that the contested sentence concerned him personally the district court had accepted his claim without analysing whether the impugned statement were indeed directed at him proceeding in respect of the second applicant on an unspecified date the proceeding against the author of the article were resumed and the second applicant wa summoned to appear before the leninskiy district court a the defendant in mr p defamation case instituted on august his case wa heard by a bench composed of the presiding judge s and two lay assessor the second applicant lodged an objection against judge s on the ground that he had already expressed his position in the judgment against the editorial board lay assessor examined and rejected the objection finding that the second applicant fear a to mr s impartiality were not justified at the hearing on october the second applicant wa represented by mr r a counsel the second applicant and his counsel both argued that the last sentence of the article did not concern mr p it concerned the collector of fund who had not been identified in the article the fact that other newspaper had interpreted the last sentence a directed at mr p wa irrelevant because the second applicant could not be held responsible for the action of other people they further submitted that the second applicant had simply repeated the reservation expressed by businessmen with regard to the distribution of the fund collected for the project counsel for mr p repeated the argument he had advanced at the hearing of september in particular the reason why mr p believed that the contested statement were directed at him he submitted in particular that the title and the structure of the article showed that it wa entirely about mr p and that other people had understood the last sentence of the article a concerning mr p and this had been proved by article in other newspaper on october the leninskiy district court issued a judgment against the second applicant the court found that the article read a a whole gave the impression that the contested statement concerned mr p the same interpretation had been arrived at by other newspaper which had been unanimous in considering that the last sentence had been about mr p the contested statement which accused mr p of spending public fund on lover were damaging to his honour dignity and professional reputation the second applicant had failed to prove the truthfulness of his statement about mr p the second applicant wa ordered to pay rur approximately euro in compensation for nonpecuniary damage and rur in court fee the second applicant appealed he repeated the argument advanced in his statement in support of the first applicant appeal he further argued that the outcome of his case had been predetermined by the judgment against the editorial board judge s who had examined the case against the editorial board wa bound to have had a preconceived opinion on his case appeal proceeding in respect of the applicant on october the kirov regional court adjourned the examination of the appeal it established that the interim decision of september rectifying an error in the judgment of september had been issued in the absence of the interested party moreover the party had not received a copy of that decision and had thereby been deprived of an opportunity to appeal until that omission had been remedied the appeal against the judgment of september could not be examined nor could the appeal against the judgment of october because both case were based on the same claim the determination of one of them would prejudge the outcome of the other on that ground the kirov regional court decided that the two case should be joined and all appeal should be examined simultaneously on november the first applicant lodged an appeal against the interim decision of september it argued that that decision wa unlawful for the following reason the rectification had been made by the district court of it own motion the decision had been taken in the absence of the party and in substance the decision wa the disguised substitution of a defendant rather than a correction of a clerical error or an obvious mistake the first applicant submitted that the limited liability company the editorial board of the vesti newspaper and the editorial board of the gubernskie vesti newspaper were two distinct entity the first wa registered a a legal entity while the second wa operating without state registration the fact that the district court had issued a judgment against the wrong entity demonstrated that the adjudication of the case had been superficial and the essential aspect of the case had not been examined properly on november the leninskiy district court by a new interim decision confirmed it earlier decision of september on the rectification of the error regarding the defendant name the first applicant lodged an appeal repeating the argument advanced in the appeal statement of november on december the kirov regional court examined all the appeal both applicant were represented at the hearing by mr r the kirov regional court quashed the interim decision of september on the ground that it had been issued in the absence of the party but upheld the interim decision of november which in it view wa lawful thus it found that counsel who had taken part in the hearing of september had represented the interest of the first applicant the limited liability company the editorial board of the vesti newspaper it wa clear that the judgment of september defined the right of and imposed obligation on the first applicant because no other organisation had been involved in the proceeding the amendment of the defendant name had therefore been no more than a rectification of a clerical error not related to the merit of the case and having no effect on the substance of the judgment the regional court further upheld the judgment of september and october in substance in particular it found that the district court had addressed the applicant argument relating to the existence of an objective link between the contested statement and the plaintiff it had analysed the tile structure and content of the impugned article and had correctly found that it last sentence concerned mr p moreover it had taken into account that mr p wa not the only one to have understood that the sentence had been directed at him other newspaper had also drawn the same conclusion the district court had therefore correctly required the defendant to prove the truthfulness of their allegation which they had failed to do both applicant had been represented at hearing by counsel and their procedural right had therefore been respected finally the regional court held that the severance of the claim against the second applicant from the proceeding had not involved a substantially incorrect determination of the dispute the regional court found however that the district court had incorrectly required the first applicant to publish the retraction statement drafted by the plaintiff the requirement for an apology a promise to discipline the author and an undertaking to respect domestic law contained in the retraction statement had no basis in domestic law the order for immediate enforcement had also been unlawful the court ordered that the first applicant publish an amended retraction statement it also reduced the award payable by the first applicant to rur approximately euro

which could be reached via the link on the austrian website included the following statement equating the babycaust to the holocaust would mean relativising today abortion murder den babycaust mit dem holocaust gleichzusetzen würde bedeuten die heutigen abtreibungsmorde zu relativieren moreover on the home page of the austrian website the following statement wa shown between two photo of baby one

of their mother pervertierte ärzte ermordeten im auftrag der mütter die ungeborenen kinder from that page the reader wa directed to a locationbased alphabetical list mentioning the name and practice address of many doctor across germany who performed abortion the list wa accompanied by an invitation to pray for these doctor dr f the plaintiff in the main proceeding wa mentioned on the list he wa of jewish faith and his family had suffered from the atrocity carried out during the national socialist era b domestic proceeding dr f applied to the court for an injunction against the applicant and mh a well a for damage for the violation of his personality right he argued that the website in question had generated a direct association between the named doctor and the third reich equated abortion with the crime of the third reich and stigmatised him a a murderer on february the karlsruhe regional court ordered the applicant to desist from using andor allowing the use of the term aggravated murder on the german website or the austrian website to describe abortion performed by dr f who wa named on those website it also ordered the applicant a joint and several debtor gesamtschuldner with mh to pay dr f compensation of euro eur a similar order against mh wa issued in a separate judgment the karlsruhe regional court gave the following ground for it decision firstly it established that the statement at issue could be attributed to the applicant the fact that the said content wa accessible only via the indirect route of the austrian website operated by mh wa irrelevant the applicant had made the content his own by having referred and created a link on the german website expressly to mhs website he had also not disputed during the proceeding that the statement had originated from him moreover throughout the proceeding he had continuously and with conviction described abortion a aggravated murder and considered the comparison of abortion and the holocaust reflected even in the babycaust domain name to be appropriate in a next step the court analysed screenshots of the website which had been submitted by the plaintiff it concluded that the website at issue contained the general statement that abortion a performed by dr f were act of aggravated murder comparable with the utterly unjustifiable atrocity inflicted on jew in the third reich by mentioning dr f name and his practice address directly in this context the applicant had reproached the doctor specifically for performing abortion and had created a pillory effect even though the applicant had made his statement in the context of a public debate of fundamental importance and freedom of expression protected polemical and sharp criticism the applicant comment on the german website and the austrian website had not been posted a broad criticism but specifically against the doctor mentioned on those site the applicant had purposefully undermined the plaintiff right of personality by labelling abortion a aggravated murder equating it to the crime of the holocaust and reproaching dr f specifically for his involvement this wa also true on the assumption that the statement constituted an expression of opinion and not a factual claim consequently the weighing of all those consideration turned out in favour of dr f general right of personality which in these circumstance prevailed over the applicant freedom of expression a regard damage the karlsruhe regional court reasoned that the violation of the right of personality and the associated stigmatising effect were particularly serious given that dr f himself wa jewish and his family had suffered directly the nazi atrocity in the third reich moreover the court took into account that the applicant had persistently made these or similar statement and had not been dissuaded by order to desist issued against him such a the decision of the karlsruhe court of appeal of february u to which the website referred see paragraph above or the inclusion of the website on the list of publication harmful to minor by the federal review board by indicative order of september the karlsruhe court of appeal notified the applicant of it intention to dismiss his appeal owing to insufficient prospect of success the court elaborated that the regional court conclusion that the austrian website had levelled the serious and personal allegation against dr f that he had performed act of aggravated murder the allegation had further involved comparing abortion to the extermination of jew under nazi rule this had constituted a serious attack on dr f reputation and personality right the court of appeal also confirmed that the applicant had to assume responsibility for the content of the austrian website he had given the relevant content from his own website over to mh and had given his consent by mean of a link for it to be posted on the austrian website moreover the award of monetary compensation wa appropriate in the light of the severity of the interference with the general right of personality the regional court had correctly taken into account to the detriment of the applicant that he had failed to observe the legally binding decision of the karlsruhe court of appeal of february the court further clarified that for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation to be awarded it wa irrelevant whether dr f wa jewish and that his family had been persecuted under the nazi regime in support of that view the court adjudged that there were no apparent indication that the applicant had had or should have had any such knowledge the applicant wa provided with the opportunity to submit his position on the above reasoning which he made use of to no avail on february the karlsruhe court of appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant without an oral hearing it referred to it reasoning in the indicative order of september and emphasised that the awarded damage had been justified irrespective of whether dr f wa jewish on april the federal constitutional court refused to admit a complaint by the applicant for adjudication for being inadmissible bv r without providing reason ii

13,in and life in genappe he wa represented by mr a berenboom lawyer the belgian government the government were represented by their agent m i niedlispacher of the federal justice department background to the case the applicant is the publisher of the newspaper le soir one of belgium leading frenchlanguage newspaper in a print edition of the newspaper an article reported among other item on a car accident caused by g that had led to the death of two people and injured three others the article mentioned g full name g wa convicted in connection with the incident in he served his sentence and wa formally rehabilitated in since june the newspaper website ha provided an electronic version of it archive dating back to including the abovementioned article when the archive were published online and throughout the proceeding before the domestic court the article were freely accessible on the website on june july and august g wrote to the legal department of the public limited company rossel et compagnie which owned le soir requesting that the article be removed from the newspaper electronic archive or at least rendered anonymous in support of his request g referred to the fact that he wa a doctor and that the article appeared on the list of search result when his name wa typed into several search engine on january the legal department of rossel et compagnie refused to remove the impugned article from the archive but stated that it had given notice to the administrator of the search engine google to delist the article a reminder wa sent to the administrator of google on february before the domestic court the applicant stated that these step had produced no response the court ha not been informed of any subsequent followup action on march g brought the case before the council for journalistic ethic conseil de déontologie journalistique the cdj the selfregulatory body of the french and germanspeaking medium in belgium on april the cdj declared the request inadmissible on the ground that the dispute did not concern a matter of journalistic ethic it pointed to the solution that had been adopted by belgian newspaper publisher with regard to electronic press archive namely the right to rectification in case where the information wa inaccurate and the right of electronic communication in case where the information wa incomplete domestic court proceeding in a summons served on may g instituted proceeding against the applicant in the neufchâteau court of first instance seeking to have the online press archive in question anonymised on the basis of article of the civil code in the alternative should the applicant actually provide irrefutable technical evidence of the impossibility of making the information anonymous g sought an order requiring him to add a noindex tag to the online version of the article to prevent it from appearing on the list of result when his name wa typed into the search engine of the newspaper website in g view by keeping the article online without anonymising it or adding a noindex tag despite receiving a reasonable and substantiated request to that effect the applicant had committed a fault and had infringed g right to be forgotten in a judgment of january the court of first instance allowed most of g claim noting that the applicant had not adduced any evidence of the impossibility of anonymising the article the court ordered him to replace g first name and surname by the letter x in the digital version of the article featured on the newspaper website and on any other database for which he wa responsible the applicant wa ordered to pay one euro to g in respect of nonpecuniary damage and to pay g cost the court rejected the request for an anonymised version of the judgment to be sent to the party and to possible third party and for the judgment to be declared immediately enforceable in a judgment of september the liège court of appeal upheld the lower court judgment in it entirety the court of appeal began by pointing out that each of the party had fundamental right that were not absolute and were of equal ranking a to the criterion of lawfulness required in order to derogate from the principle of freedom of expression the court of appeal noted that the right to be forgotten wa considered an integral part of the right to respect for private life a enshrined in article of the convention article of the international covenant on civil and political right and article of the constitution that wa sufficient to satisfy the lawfulness test in order to derogate from the principle of freedom of expression the court dismissed the applicant argument that article of the civil code did not provide a clear and foreseeable legal basis the provision in question constituted the ordinary rule on liability and wa applicable to news organisation which could not be unaware that they might be held liable if the exercise of press freedom caused damage resulting from an infringement of the right of others a the court of first instance had observed article et seq of the civil code a interpreted by the belgian legal literature and caselaw constituted legislation that wa sufficiently accessible clear precise and foreseeable for the purpose of article of the convention the court of appeal added that alongside the traditional aspect of the right to be forgotten linked to the fresh disclosure by the press of a person previous conviction there existed a second aspect linked to the erasure of the digital data and in particular the data available on the internet the dispute which concerned the digitisation of journalistic archive related to the latter aspect namely the right to be forgotten online what wa sought therefore wa the removal of information available on the internet this right to be forgotten online had recently been established by the court of justice of the european union the cjeu in it judgment in google spain and google c may see paragraph below the cjeu had held that the requirement regarding fresh disclosure of the information could be inferred from the effect of the search tool which gave prominence to information that would not otherwise be visible online it wa true that the cjeu judgment concerned a dispute between a private individual and the operator of a search engine nevertheless the principle established by that judgment could be transposed to the case at hand in so far a the publisher had also enabled the article in question to be given prominence via the search engine of the newspaper website which wa accessible free of charge the effect had also been multiplied significantly by the development of the operating software used by googletype search engine the indexing of the article on search engine wa only possible because it wa present in the database of le soir in nonanonymised form and without any noindex tag the right to be forgotten online wa not unlimited and had to be regulated in so far a it wa liable to come into conflict with the freedom of expression of the press in order to ass whether a balance had been struck between the fundamental right enshrined inter alia in article and of the convention it wa necessary to have regard to the criterion defined in the court caselaw von hannover v germany no gc no and echr and the caselaw of the cjeu google spain and google cited above thus in order for a right to be forgotten to be recognised the fact had to have been disclosed lawfully in the first place and had to be of a judicial nature there could be no current interest in their disclosure the fact could not be of historical interest a certain time had to have elapsed between the two disclosure and the person concerned could not be a public figure had to have an interest in being reintegrated into society and had to have discharged his or her debt the court of appeal task in the case before it wa to ascertain whether in the light of these criterion the restriction on press freedom stemming from g request pursued a legitimate aim and satisfied the proportionality test in conformity with article of the convention in the instant case the court of appeal found that it wa not disputed that the original disclosure of the information in question had been lawful and that the fact reported on had been of a judicial nature the fresh disclosure of the fact had no value in term of newsworthiness g did not hold any public office the mere fact that he wa a doctor in no way justified his continued identification in the online article some twenty year after the event the court considered this to be illegitimate and disproportionate since it did not add anything to the value of the article and wa liable to cause indefinite and serious harm to g reputation by giving him a virtual criminal record despite the fact that he had not only served his sentence after a final conviction for the offence but had also been rehabilitated twenty year after the event the identity of a person who wa not a public figure did not enhance the public interest of the article which merely contributed at a statistical level to a public debate on road safety in the court of appeal view removing g first name and surname did not render the information devoid of interest since it would have no impact on the actual substance of the information conveyed which concerned a tragic road traffic accident caused in particular by the harmful effect of alcohol the applicant argument concerning the duty of remembrance and the need to preserve a full and faithful record in the archive were irrelevant g had not requested that the impugned article be removed from the archive but simply that the electronic version be rendered anonymous the paper archive remained intact and the applicant wa still able to ensure the integrity of the original digital version the event reported on in the article were clearly not of historical significance a the article related to a banal albeit tragic news story which wa not alleged still le demonstrated to have been a source of particular public concern lastly a significant length of time sixteen year had elapsed between the initial publication of the article and the first request for anonymisation some twenty year had passed by the time of delivery of the judgment it followed from all these consideration that g satisfied the criterion for claiming a right to be forgotten and that keeping the article in question online without rendering it anonymous wa liable to cause him disproportionate harm when weighed against the benefit of strict observance of the applicant right to freedom of expression the criterion of lawfulness legitimacy and proportionality arising out of article of the convention were satisfied in the court of appeal view the request for anonymisation had been apt to ensure a proper balance between the interest at stake that balance would not be achieved by the establishment of a right to digital rectification or communication a proposed by the applicant such procedure would not be appropriate a they would allow the stigmatising effect of the serious offence committed by g and of the sentence he had already served to persist indefinitely and would render the rehabilitation order given in his favour meaningless hence the most effective mean of protecting g privacy without interfering to a disproportionate extent with the applicant freedom of expression wa to anonymise the article on the website of le soir by replacing g first name and surname with the letter x in the court of appeal view by refusing to accede to the request to anonymise the article the applicant had not acted in the way that any prudent and diligent publisher would act in the same circumstance that refusal constituted a fault a simple search using g first name and surname in the search engine on le soirs website or on google immediately brought up the article that wa undoubtedly a source of damage to g at least of a nonpecuniary nature such a situation made knowledge of his previous conviction easily accessible to a wide audience and wa thus liable to stigmatise him seriously damage his reputation and prevent him from reintegrating into society normally a causal link between the fault and the damage sustained had also been established acceding to g request did not confer on each and every individual a subjective right to rewrite history nor did it make it possible to falsify history or impose an excessive burden of responsibility on the applicant the court of appeal wa called upon to determine a specific dispute between two party in the context of a oneoff civil action for damage based on article of the civil code while seeking to ensure that a balance wa struck between two fundamental right claimed by the party the applicant further argued before the court of appeal that the way in which the database of le soir worked meant that it wa not possible to alter archived article and thus to replace g name with the letter x the court of appeal noted that in support of his claim the applicant had submitted a report drawn up by the newspaper technical department however the court considered that the report in question which had been prepared after the applicant had been given notice to appear by technician who were in a relationship of dependency with the applicant did not provide any guarantee of impartiality and had no probative value moreover the report did not state that it wa actually impossible to implement the measure requested but simply referred to the risk and cost the only reference to impossibility concerned the physical impossibility of withdrawing the newspaper that had been sold the collection that had been distributed and the numerous copy of the content available in physical and digital format in the public domain something that had not been requested the applicant appealed on point of law in one of his ground of appeal he alleged a violation of article of the convention in particular he argued in the first limb of the ground of appeal that the fault he had allegedly committed consisted in disregarding a subjective right namely the right to be forgotten although that right wa not enshrined either in clear precise and accessible domestic legislation or in a higherranking international rule but wa derived solely from the legal literature and caselaw hence in the applicant view the court of appeal judgment had breached the requirement that the interference be lawful in the second limb of the ground of appeal the applicant contended that the order for him to alter in the online archive the content of an article that had been published in the past and wa available in the paper archive amounted to unjustified interference with his freedom of expression in breach of article of the convention in a judgment of april the court of cassation dismissed the appeal on point of law it found that the first limb of the ground of appeal arguing that the court of appeal had based the right to be forgotten online on the legal literature and caselaw failed on factual ground the court of cassation held a follows it follows from the reasoning of the court of appeal judgment firstly that the judgment under challenge regard the right to be forgotten online a an intrinsic component of the right to respect for private life and indeed state so and view such interference with the right to freedom of expression a may be justified in order to protect that right a being based not on the legal literature and caselaw which the judgment doe not recognise a having general regulatory scope but on article of the convention article of the international covenant on civil and political right and article of the constitution and secondly that it refers to the judgment of the court of justice of the european union only to lend support to it view on the scope of that right to be forgotten a to the second limb the court of cassation held that the right to respect for private life which encompassed the right to be forgotten might justify interference with the right to freedom of expression the digital archiving of an old press article which at the time it wa printed had lawfully reported on past event that were now covered by the right to be forgotten wa not exempt from possible interference with the right to freedom of expression in order to protect the right to be forgotten such interference might consist in altering the archived text so a to prevent or make good a breach of the right to be forgotten the court of appeal had ruled lawfully that the online archiving of the article in question had amounted to a fresh disclosure of g previous conviction that wa liable to infringe his right to be forgotten the court of appeal had subsequently weighed up the right of the party and had provided legal justification for it ruling that the applicant by refusing to accede to the request for the article to be anonymised had committed a fault it had therefore lawfully ordered him to replace g first name and surname with the letter x on the website of le soir accordingly the second limb of the ground of appeal had to be dismissed it appears that the article in question is still available on the newspaper website but is accessible only to subscriber it is accompanied by a notice referring to the relevant judicial decision relevant legal framework and practice domestic law and practiceprotection of the fundamental right at stake and the right to be forgotten the belgian constitution guarantee freedom to manifest one opinion on all matter article and freedom of the press article a well a the right to respect for private and family life article prior to the event giving rise to the present case the right to be forgotten had been recognised by the lower court a an integral part of the right to respect for private life see for instance brussels court of appeal ref december jt p brussels

number of chapter for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purpose or the purpose of artistic or literary expression only if they were necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with the rule governing freedom of expression in it judgment of may case c euc google spain sl and google inc hereafter google spain the court of justice of the european union the cjeu wa called upon to define the extent of the right and obligation arising out of directive ec with regard to internet search engine the case originated in a complaint lodged by a spanish national with the spanish data protection agency against a spanish daily newspaper and google the applicant had complained that when an internet user entered his name in google search engine the list of result displayed link to two page of the newspaper mentioning his name in connection with an auction following attachment proceeding he had requested the newspaper either to remove or alter those page so that the personal data relating to him no longer appeared or to use certain tool made available by search engine in order to protect his data he had also requested google to remove or conceal the personal data relating to him so that they ceased to be included in the search result and in the link to the newspaper while the spanish agency had rejected the complaint against the newspaper it had upheld the complaint against google which brought an action before the spanish court it wa in the context of this judicial dispute that the case wa referred to the cjeu for a preliminary ruling the cjeu held that the operation carried out by operator of search engine should be classified a data processing of which they were the controller article b and d regardless of the fact that these data had already been published on the internet and had not been altered by the search engine it stated that in so far a the activity of a search engine could be distinguished from and wa additional to that carried out by publisher of website and also affected the fundamental right of the person concerned the operator of the search engine had to ensure in particular that the guarantee laid down by the directive could have full effect moreover given the ease with which information published on a website could be replicated on other site effective and complete protection of data user and particularly of their right to privacy could not be achieved if they had to obtain first or in parallel the erasure of the information relating to them from the publisher of website the cjeu concluded that the operator of a search engine wa obliged to remove link to web page that were published by third party and contained information relating to a person from the list of result displayed following a search made on the basis of that person name including in case where the name or information had not been erased beforehand or simultaneously from those web page and even a applicable when it publication on those page wa in itself lawful the cjeu added that even initially lawful processing of accurate data could in the course of time become incompatible with the directive where those data were no longer necessary in the light of the purpose for which they had been collected or processed that wa so in particular where they appeared to be inadequate irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive in relation to those purpose and in the light of the time that had elapsed the cjeu concluded that if under article and of the european union charter of fundamental right guaranteeing respectively the right to respect for private life and the right to the protection of personal data the person concerned had a right to ensure that the information in question relating to them personally should no longer be linked to their name by a list of result and they were thus entitled to request that the information in question no longer be made available to the general public on account of it inclusion in such a list of result those right overrode a a rule not only the economic interest of the operator of the search engine but also the interest of the general public in having access to that information through a search relating to the name of the person concerned however according to the cjeu that would not be the case if it appeared for particular reason such a the role played by the person concerned in public life that the interference with their fundamental right wa justified by the preponderant interest of the general public in having on account of it inclusion in the list of result access to the information in question regarding the difference in treatment between the publisher of a web page and the operator of a search engine the cjeu found a follows furthermore the processing by the publisher of a web page consisting in the publication of information relating to an individual may in some circumstance be carried out solely for journalistic purpose and thus benefit by virtue of article of directive from derogation from the requirement laid down by the directive whereas that doe not appear to be so in the case of the processing carried out by the operator of a search engine it can not therefore be ruled out that in certain circumstance the data subject is capable of exercising the right referred to in article b and subparagraph a of the first paragraph of article of directive against that operator but not against the publisher of the web page finally it must be stated that not only doe the ground under article of directive justifying the publication of a piece of personal data on a website not necessarily coincide with that which is applicable to the activity of search engine but also even where that is the case the outcome of the weighing of the interest at issue to be carried out under article f and subparagraph a of the first paragraph of article of the directive may differ according to whether the processing carried out by the operator of a search engine or that carried out by the publisher of the web page is at issue given that first the legitimate interest justifying the processing may be different and second the consequence of the processing for the data subject and in particular for his private life are not necessarily the same indeed since the inclusion in the list of result displayed following a search made on the basis of a person name of a web page and of the information contained on it relating to that person make access to that information appreciably easier for any internet user making a search in respect of the person concerned and may play a decisive role in the dissemination of that information it is liable to constitute a more significant interference with the data subject fundamental right to privacy than the publication on the web page in the guideline on the implementation of the court of justice of the european union judgment in the case of google spain sl and google inc v agencia española de protección de datos aepd and mario costeja gonzález c adopted on november the article data protection working party stated a follows search engine included in web page do not produce the same effect a external search engine on the one hand they only recover the information contained on specific web page on the other and even if a user look for the same person in a number of web page internal search engine will not establish a complete profile of the affected individual and the result will not have a serious impact on him therefore a a rule the right to delisting should not apply to search engine with a restricted field of action particularly in the case of search tool of website of newspaper from the material point of view and a it been already mentioned the ruling expressly state that the right only affect the result obtained on search made by the name of the individual and never suggests that the complete deletion of the page from the index of the search engine is needed the page should still be accessible using any other term of search it is worth mentioning that the ruling us the term name without further specification the second part of the guideline concern common criterion which the data protection authority are invited to apply in handling complaint following refusal of delisting by search engine the relevant part of the eighth and thirteenth criterion read a follows is the data processing causing prejudice to the data subject doe the data have a disproportionately negative privacy impact on the data subject the data might have a disproportionately negative impact on the data subject where a search result relates to a trivial or foolish misdemeanour which is no longer or may never have been the subject of public debate and where there is no wider public interest in the availability of the information doe the data relate to a criminal offence eu member state may have different approach a to the public availability of information about offender and their offence specific legal provision may exist which have an impact on the availability of such information over time data protection authority will handle such case in accordance with the relevant national principle and approach a a rule data protection authority are more likely to consider the delisting of search result relating to relatively minor offence that happened a long time ago whilst being le likely to consider the delisting of result relating to more serious one that happened more recently however these issue call for careful consideration and will be handled on a casebycase basis after the court of appeal had given it judgment in the present case regulation eu of the european parliament and of the council of april on the protection of natural person with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data the gdpr repealed directive ec of october article of the gdpr provides a follows article right to erasure right to be forgotten the data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following ground appliesa the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which they were collected or otherwise processed where the controller ha made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph to erase the personal data the controller taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation shall take reasonable step including technical measure to inform controller which are processing the personal data that the data subject ha requested the erasure by such

who had arrested the applicant gave evidence police officer a described edinburgh road a a major route into perth from the motorway it wa a busy road and at the material time there wa a continuous flow of traffic along the road he wa firmly of the view that the applicant nudity in a public place would cause alarm to anyone during crossexamination by the applicant police officer a agreed that the human body wa in itself decent and wa not harmful or alarming he accepted that nothing in the applicant behaviour at the time of his arrest other than his nakedness gave the police any cause for concern police officer b gave evidence that she considered the fact that the applicant had no clothes on in a public place to be very strange and unusual and that she wa quite shocked by it she explained that at the time edinburgh road had been very busy with vehicular and pedestrian traffic she had previously seen elderly people and child in the area and there were school and housing nearby in crossexamination she also agreed that the human body in itself wa not harmful indecent or bad but maintained that although she had been forewarned that she would be likely to see a naked man in public she had still been shocked she confirmed that no complaint had been received from member of the public the applicant gave evidence in his defence when asked by the prosecution why he wa wearing no clothes he replied that he wa making a stand and that were innocent until we do something wrong he did not believe that he wa causing harm by not wearing clothes he said that he did not wear clothes in order to provoke a reaction although he had not always been like that a he had grown older he had thought more about his belief when asked what he hoped to achieve by making his stand the applicant replied that he did it because he felt that it wa right and that the world changed in it own wayii the conviction and sentence the sheriff found the applicant guilty of breach of the peace and contempt of court he considered that being naked in a public place and refusing to wear clothes in a public place wa conduct that would be alarming and disturbing in it context to any reasonable person in his stated case prepared in the context of the applicant later appeal the sheriff explained there wa no dispute on the fact of the case i accepted that the police officer were concerned that if the appellant did not put clothes on there wa a very real likelihood of him causing fear and alarm to other member of the public he continued the position of the appellant is somewhat difficult to understand he made it clear to the two police officer that he had no intention whatsoever of putting clothes on he insisted on being naked in a public place he believed that he wa doing no wrong by being naked in a public place he did not accept that he had committed an offence he noted that in questioning the police officer the applicant had chosen not to differentiate between private and public place when it came to nakedness he concluded i wa entirely satisfied that the conduct of the appellant with the aggravation of his refusal to wear clothing in a public place amounted to a breach of the peace the criterion for a breach of the peace a discussed in the case of smith v donnelly had been met the evidence of the appellant did not raise a doubt in my mind accordingly i convicted the appellant a libelled at sentencing the sheriff had before him the applicant previous conviction according to the stated case the applicant confirmed to the sheriff that all previous conviction were for breach of the peace the sheriff stated case continued he acknowledged that he had spent the last five year or thereby in prison for the same offence a pattern ha emerged namely that on his release from prison when he stepped out of the prison gate always naked he wa immediately arrested i asked the appellant what he wa hoping to achieve by insisting on being naked in public he talked about his belief i simply could not understand what he had to say in this regard he did not appear to be waging any campaign or making a protest he informed me that he would rather not be in prison if he wa not in prison he would go back to live with his mother in a village in cornwall he had previously worked a a driver of large good vehicle the sheriff discussed sentencing option with the applicant in his stated case he explained i enquired of him if i wa minded to defer sentence for whatever reason and admit him to a bail order would he then wear clothes after some thought the appellant stated that he would not be prepared to wear clothes the sheriff stated case concluded taking all these matter into account i could see no alternative to a custodial sentence in view of the content of the notice of previous conviction i deemed it appropriate to impose the maximum of month imprisonment which i backdated to the date that he had been taken into custody a further four month imprisonment to run concurrently wa imposed for contempt of courtc the appeal the applicant sought to appeal his conviction and sentence by way of note of appeal and a draft stated case wa prepared by the sheriff in september the applicant wa provided with a copy of the stated case and wa asked for detail of any proposed change by letter of october the applicant proposed a number of change on october a hearing wa held to consider the proposed adjustment to the case stated the applicant wa brought from hmp perth to attend the hearing and blanket were provided to facilitate his attendance he wa told that if he refused to wear clothes or make use of the blanket he would not be admitted into the court he refused to wear clothes or to make use of the blanket and wa accordingly not permitted to attend the adjustment hearing the hearing proceeded in his absence and his requested adjustment were considered by the sheriff two adjustment were allowed and the remaining adjustment rejected concerned that the stated case wa biased the applicant did not lodge it with the justiciary office on october the expiry of the applicable timelimit for lodging his appeal wa deemed abandoned the applicant spent his sentence in segregation at hmp perth a he refused to wear clothes on december he wa released from prison the december arrest minute after his release on december the applicant wa arrested and charged with breach of the peace for being naked in public he wa detained on remand on january he wa convicted of breach of the peace sentence wa deferred to february for uptodate psychiatric and psychological assessment on february the applicant wa sentenced to a term of twelve month imprisonment plus day unserved from previous sentence he lodged an appeal the outcome of the appeal is not known he wa kept in segregation at hmp perth while in prison because he refused to dress he wa released on october the october arrest minute after his release on october the applicant wa arrested and charged with breach of the peace for being naked in public he wa detained on remand on november he wa found guilty of breach of the peace and contempt of court on november he wa sentenced to day imprisonment in respect of the breach of the peace charge together with day unserved from previous sentence plus day for contempt of court to be served consecutively he wa not kept in segregation while in prison at hmp perth he wa released on july the july arresta the arrest minute after his release on july at around am the applicant wa approached by two police officer on manson terrace a public road leading from hmp perth to edinburgh road the officer suggested that he put on some clothes but he refused to do so he wa arrested him for breach of the peace and detained on remand he appeared in court on july and pleaded not guiltyb the trial proceeding the trial commenced on august the applicant appeared in court naked and wa warned by the sheriff that if he refused to dress or to cover himself he might be held in contempt of court he refused to put on clothesi the evidence the prosecution led evidence of two police officer witness at trial their evidence wa similar to that given at the trial and the applicant crossexamination wa also in similar term and elicited similar response see paragraph above the applicant did not give evidence in his defence he argued that his arrest and trial violated the convention he relied inter alia on article arguing that there wa no reasonable suspicion which would satisfy an objective observer that he had committed an offence article arguing that his arrest wa arbitrary a it wa based on the subjective belief that his nakedness wa offensive article arguing that he had a strong view that there wa nothing indecent about his body and that view wa not being respected article arguing that he ought to have been given the right to express his view that nakedness wa not indecent in the way that he had chosen to do and article arguing that he wa being discriminated against because he had different view from the majority of peopleii the conviction and sentence the sheriff found that the applicant conduct on july wa severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people threatened serious disturbance to the community and presented a genuinely alarming in it context to any reasonable person he therefore convicted the applicant in his stated case prepared in the context of the later appeal proceeding the sheriff referred to the applicant convention argument and continued i should say that none of these argument were developed to any extent and it wa not always easy to see what the applicant full argument wa i came to the conclusion that none of the article suggested by the appellant had been contravened in the procedure a to the conviction handed down he explained in my view there wa no doubt about the fact in this case the question wa whether the conduct amounted to a breach of the peace i wa of the view that the first part of the test wa easily met by the conduct the appellant wa walking along a public street in full view of anyone passing and he wa completely naked with his private part entirely on show such conduct would be severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people especially when it wa being carried out in an ordinary public street it might be different if he had been naked somewhere in private even in a public place which wa remote or where fewer people would be congregated but in or near one of the main street of a busy town his appearance in that state would be alarming the question which wa more troubling wa whether the second part of the test wa met would the conduct cause serious disturbance to the community i came to the conclusion that the context in which the conduct wa taking place being naked in a brazen fashion in the public street with no attempt to cover himself and no obvious explanation or reason for the conduct would cause serious disturbance to the community because of the reaction of ordinary people to his presence in that state in that place that would be particularly so if the community could see that child or vulnerable old people might be present i considered that the test wa met and that the charge wa proved beyond reasonable doubt i therefore found the appellant guilty the applicant wa sentenced to a term of imprisonment of day for the breach of the peace and day for the contempt charge together with day unspent from his previous sentence a total of day the sentence were not backdated and they were to run consecutively the total length of the sentence wa therefore one year nine month and eighteen daysc the appeal the applicant sought to appeal his conviction by way of note of appeal and a draft stated case wa prepared by the sheriff adjustment to the stated case were proposed by both party and a hearing wa held the applicant wa not permitted to attend the hearing since he refused to wear clothes on october the applicant lodged an appeal by way of case stated relying on article and of the convention on november the applicant application for leave to appeal wa considered by the first sift judge leave wa refused for the following reason the appeal is not arguable the sheriff ha carefully explained the reason for arriving at his decision there wa no infringement of the appellant right in term of the european convention on human right on december the applicant wa refused leave on the second sift the judge found that for the reason given by the first sift judge the appeal wa not arguable the applicant wa not kept in segregation while serving his sentence at hmp perth he wa released on july subsequent arrest in scotland on the same day the applicant wa arrested and charged with breach of the peace he wa not held in custody on august a decision wa made to take no further action meanwhile on july he wa arrested on the outskirt of dunfermline and charged with breach of the peace he wa

to discus this with the relevant staff and book a visit no visit took place on november the applicant contacted the ombudsman with a complaint that the scottish prison service sps wa unreasonably

generally limited a long a he remained naked he wa not permitted to access the gym for health and safety reason however effort were made to give him access to book and to explore further work or hobby that could be conducted in his cell throughout his time in segregation the applicant wa reviewed regularly by health care professional on january the applicant complained to the prison authority that he wa not allowed to associate with other prisoner or to exercise by reply dated january he wa told that he wa not being denied association or exercise but had excluded himself from these activity by refusing to wear clothes the applicant referred the complaint to the icc on february but the icc decided that the current arrangement were satisfactory it noted that if the applicant were to wear clothes he would be permitted to associate with other prisoner however his choice to remain naked gave rise to serious concern that he might be the victim of violence or unwarranted comment and the prison had an obligation to ensure his safety in march the applicant complained to the ombudsman that the sps had given an unreasonable explanation for denying him access to association and exercise by reply dated may the ombudsman informed him that his complaint had not been upheld because prison staff had confirmed that if he wore clothes he would be able to associate with other prisoner and exercise attempt to secure legal representation and exemption from court fee the applicant contacted the law society of scotland seeking detail of solicitor in edinburgh experienced in judicial review

informed that none were willing to represent him he then contacted the court of session to request information regarding exemption from court fee with a view to commencing judicial review proceeding without legal assistance he wa advised that a he wa a prisoner and not in receipt of any state benefit he wa not eligible for exemption from court fee ii relevant domestic law and practicea criminal offence in scotland breach of the peace the leading case a to what constitutes a breach of the peace under scot law is smith v donnelly slt where the appeal court said the crime of breach of the peace can be committed in a wide variety of circumstance and in many case it is a relatively minor crime it ha therefore been said more than once that a comprehensive definition which would cover all possible circumstance is neither possible nor desirable equally in our view it is neither possible nor desirable to derive a comprehensive definition from a close analysis of the fact of individual case in which it ha been held that a breach of the peace had been committed it is in our view clear that what is required to constitute the crime is conduct severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people and threaten serious disturbance to the community what is required therefore it seems to u is conduct which doe present a genuinely alarming and disturbing in it context to any reasonable person that interpretation is supported by the fact that if there is no evidence of actual alarm the conduct must be flagrant if it is to justify a conviction flagrant is a strong word and the use of that word point to a standard of conduct which would be alarming or seriously disturbing to any reasonable person in the particular circumstance we therefore conclude that the definition of the crime found in the principal authority doe meet the requirement of the convention in her majesty advocate v harris hcjac the appeal court citing smith emphasised that it wa now clear that the crime of breach of the peace involved two element conduct severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people and which threatened serious disturbance to the community the maximum sentence for a breach of the peace depends upon the court in which the offence is tried when prosecuted in summary proceeding in the sheriff court the maximum sentence is a fine of up to five thousand pound sterling or imprisonment of one year breach of bail condition pursuant to section b of the criminal procedure scotland act the act it is an offence to fail without reasonable excuse to comply with any condition

criminalises public nudity it is punishable by the imposition of an administrative fine other state andorra belgium france germany and switzerland appear to penalise exhibitionism but the term is

court landesgericht für strafsachen wien the regional court informed the applicant that the court might adopt a different legal classification in the matter from the one contained in the charge the hearing wa therefore postponed to give her time to properly prepare a defence at the end of the hearing on february the regional court acquitted the applicant in relation to several of the statement originally included in the indictment under article of the criminal code this wa partly because the public prosecutor had withdrawn the indictment concerning certain statement and partly because it could not be established that the applicant had made some of the other statement exactly or at least approximately a they were worded in the indictment she wa however convicted of disparaging religious doctrine herabwürdigung religiöser lehren pursuant to article of the criminal code concerning the three remaining statement she wa ordered to pay the cost of the proceeding and a dayfine of euro eur for a period of day amounting to eur in total which would result in sixty day imprisonment in the event of default the court considered the applicant repeated infringement to be an aggravating factor and the fact that she did not have a previous criminal record to be a mitigating factor the court found her guilty of publicly disparaging an object of veneration of a domestic church or religious society namely muhammad the prophet of islam in a manner capable of arousing justified indignation geeignet berechtigtes ärgernis zu erregen the statement which the court found incriminating were the following english translation i one of the biggest problem we are facing today is that muhammad is seen a the ideal man the perfect human the perfect muslim that mean that the highest commandment for a male muslim is to imitate muhammad to live his life this doe not happen according to our social standard and law because he wa a warlord he had many woman to put it like this and liked to do it with child and according to our standard he wa not a perfect human we have huge problem with that today that muslim get into conflict with democracy and our value system the most important of all hadith collection recognised by all legal school the most important is the sahih al bukhari if a hadith wa quoted after bukhari one can be sure that all muslim would recognise it and unfortunately in al bukhari the thing with aisha and child sex is written ii i remember my sister i have said this several time already when sw made her famous statement in graz my sister called me and asked for god sake did you tell sw that to which i answered no it wasnt me but you can look it up it not really a secret and her you cant say it like that and me a yearold and a sixyearold what do you call that give me an example what do we call it if it is not paedophilia her well one ha to paraphrase it say it in a more diplomatic way my sister is symptomatic we have heard that so many time those were different time it wasnt okay back then and it not okay today full stop and it is still happening today one can never approve of something like that they all create their own reality because the truth is so cruel german original i eines der großen probleme die wir heute haben ist das mohammed al der ideale mann der perfekte mensch der perfekte muslim gesehen wird da heißt da oberste gebot für einen männlichen moslem ist e mohammed nachzumachen sein leben zu leben da läuft nicht nach unseren sozialen standard und gesetzen ab weil er war ein kriegsherr hatte einen relativ großen frauenverschleiß um da jetzt einmal so auszudrücken hatte nun mal gerne mit kindern ein bisschen wa und er war nach unseren begriffen kein perfekter mensch damit haben wir heute riesige probleme weil muslime mit der demokratie und unserem wertesystem in konflikt geraten die wichtigsten von allen rechtsschulen anerkannten hadith sammlungen die allerwichtigste ist die sahih al bukhari wenn eine hadith nach bukhari zitiert wurde dann können sie sicher sein das e alle muslime anerkennen und in der al bukhari ist auch blöderweise da geschrieben mit der aisha und dem kindersex ii ich erinnere mich an meine schwester da hab ich schon ein paar mal erzählt al sw in graz ihren berühmten sager gemacht hat ruft mich meine schwester an und sagt um gottes willen hast du ihr da gesagt worauf ich gesagt habe nein ich war nicht aber e ist nachzulesen e ist nicht wirklich ein geheimnis und sie da kann man doch so nicht sagen und ich ein jähriger und eine jährige wie nennst du da gib mir ein beispiel wie nennen wir da wenns nicht pädophilie ist sie na ja da mus man ein bisschen umschreiben diplomatischer sagen meine schwester ist symptomatisch da haben wir schon so oft gehört da waren doch andere zeiten da war damals nicht ok und e ist heute nicht ok punkt und e passiert heute auch noch so wa ist nie gutzuheißen sie legen sich alle eine wirklichkeit zurecht weil die wahrheit so grausam ist the regional court found that the above statement essentially conveyed the message that muhammad had had paedophilic tendency it stated that the applicant wa referring to a marriage which muhammad had concluded with aisha a sixyearold and consummated when she had been nine the court found that by making those statement the applicant had suggested that muhammad wa not a worthy subject of worship however it also found that it could not be established that the applicant had intended to decry all muslim she wa not suggesting that all muslim were paedophile but wa criticising the unreflecting imitation of a role model according to the court the common definition of paedophilia wa a primary sexual interest in child who had not yet reached puberty because paedophilia wa behaviour which wa ostracised by society and outlawed it wa evident that the applicant statement were capable of causing indignation the court concluded that the applicant had intended to wrongfully accuse muhammad of having paedophilic tendency even though criticising child marriage wa justifiable she had accused a subject of religious worship of having a primary sexual interest in childrens body which she had deduced from his marriage with a child disregarding the point that the marriage had continued until the prophet death when aisha had already turned eighteen and had therefore passed the age of puberty in addition the court found that because of the public nature of the seminar which had not been limited to member of the freedom party it wa conceivable that at least some of the participant might have been disturbed by the statement the regional court further stated that anyone who wished to exercise their right under article of the convention wa subject to duty and responsibility such a refraining from making statement which hurt others without reason and therefore did not contribute to a debate of public interest a balancing exercise between the right under article on the one hand and those under article on the other needed to be carried out the court considered that the applicant statement were not statement of fact but derogatory value judgment which exceeded the permissible limit it held that the applicant had not intended to approach the topic in an objective manner but had directly aimed to degrade muhammad the court stated that child marriage were not the same a paedophilia and were not only a phenomenon of islam but also used to be widespread among the european ruling dynasty furthermore the court reasoned that freedom of religion a protected by article of the convention wa one of the foundation of a democratic society those who invoked their freedom of religion could not expect to be exempt from criticism and even had to accept the negation of their belief however the manner in which religious view were attacked could engage the state responsibility in order to guarantee the peaceful exercise of the right under article presenting object of religious worship in a provocative way capable of hurting the feeling of the follower of that religion could be conceived a a malicious violation of the spirit of tolerance which wa one of the base of a democratic society the court concluded that the interference with the applicant freedom of expression in the form of a criminal conviction had been justified a it had been based in law and had been necessary in a democratic society namely in order to protect religious peace in austria the applicant appealed arguing that the impugned statement were statement of fact not value judgment she referred to several of the document which she had submitted a evidence which in her view clearly confirmed that when muhammad had been fiftysix year old he had had sexual intercourse with the nineyearold aisha she stated that it wa no more than reasonable to present those fact in the light of the value of today society it had not been her intention to disparage muhammad she had merely criticised the notion that an adult had had sexual intercourse with a nineyearold child and raised the question whether this amounted to paedophilia if one were to follow the argument of the regional court it would mean that someone who had married a child and managed to maintain the marriage until the child had come of age could not be described a a paedophile she further contended that she had not used the term paedophile in the strict scientific sense but in the way it wa used in everyday language referring to men who had sex with minor she stated that she had never said that muhammad had been a paedophile because he had married a child but because he had had sexual intercourse with one in any event her statement were covered by her right under article of the convention which included the right to impart opinion and idea that offended shocked or disturbed on december the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht wien hereinafter the court of appeal dismissed the applicant appeal confirming in essence the legal and factual finding of the lower court the regional court had based it finding on the fact a submitted by the applicant namely that muhammad had married aisha when she had been six year old and consummated the marriage when she had been nine it had rightly made a distinction between child marriage and paedophilia it had not based it finding on an unpredictable definition of the term paedophilia but on a common definition which wa comparable to that used by the world health organisation a regard the alleged violation of article of the convention the court of appeal referring to the court caselaw i̇a v turkey no echr viii and aydın tatlav v turkey no may found that it had to examine whether the comment at issue were merely provocative or had been intended a an abusive attack on the prophet of islam it concluded that the latter wa the case a muslim would find the applicant statement he liked to do it with child the thing with aisha and child sex and a yearold and a sixyearold what do you call that give me an example what do we call it if it is not paedophilia wrong and offensive even if muhammad had married a sixyearold and had had intercourse with her when she had been nine the court of appeal stated that the reason for the applicant conviction had not been that the event had purportedly taken place more than a thousand year ago and similar conduct would no longer be tolerable under today criminal law and contemporary moral and value concept but because the applicant had accused muhammad of paedophilia by using the plural form child child sex what do we call it if it is not paedophilia without providing evidence that his primary sexual interest in aisha had been her not yet having reached puberty moreover there were no reliable source for that allegation a no documentary evidence existed to suggest that his other wife or concubine had been similarly young on the contrary his first wife had been fifteen year older than him a could be seen from the document submitted by the applicant herself even if the applicant had had the right to criticise others attempt to imitate muhammad her statement showed her intention to unnecessarily disparage and deride muslim harsh criticism of church or religious society religionsgesellschaften and religious tradition and practice wa lawful however the permissible limit were exceeded where criticism ended and insult or mockery of a religious belief or person of worship beschimpfung oder verspottung einer religion oder von ihr verehrten personen began the interference with the applicant freedom under article of the convention had therefore been justified a to the applicant argument that those who had participated in the seminar knew of her critical approach and could not be offended the court of appeal found that the public seminar had been offered for free to young voter by the austrian freedom party education institute and at least one participant had been offended a her complaint had led to the applicant being charged on april the applicant lodged a request for a renewal of the proceeding antrag auf

tatlav cited above and giniewski v france no echr i it held that the aim of the interference had been to protect religious peace and the religious feeling of others and wa therefore legitimate the court had stated many time that in the context of religion member state had a duty to suppress certain form of conduct or expression that were gratuitously offensive to others and profane in case where the impugned statement not only offended or shocked or expressed a provocative opinion but had also been considered an abusive attack on a religious group for example an abusive attack on the prophet of islam a in the applicant case a criminal conviction might be necessary to protect the freedom of religion of others where a conviction wa based on article of the criminal code the principle developed under article and of the convention had to be considered when examining whether a statement wa capable of arousing justified indignation a statement could not be considered a arousing indignation if it wa compatible with article and of the convention the court therefore had to examine the meaning of the impugned statement a well a the context in which it had been made and whether the statement wa based on fact or wa a value judgment only by considering all of those point could the question of the ability to arouse justified indignation be examined applying the above consideration to the applicant case the supreme court held that she had not aimed to contribute to a serious debate about islam or the phenomenon of child marriage but merely to defame muhammad by accusing him of a specific sexual preference based on the assumption that he had had sexual intercourse with a prepubescent child in order to show that he wa not a worthy subject of worship the court whilst not misjudging the importance of the debate about sexual contact between adult and child found that the applicant had not contributed to a debate of general interest because she had made her allegation primarily in order to defame muhammad on the basis of the regional court finding that the applicant statement qualified a value judgment the supreme court held that they had not been a contribution to a serious debate the case had to be distinguished from the case of aydın tatlav cited above in which a scientific book published in it fifth edition had contained a passage of harsh criticism of religion which had not been offensive in the present case the criminal conviction constituted a measure necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention

shall equally be held liable iii international material article of the united nation international covenant on civil and political right provides any advocacy of national racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law the council of europe parliamentary assembly stated in it recommendation on blasphemy religious insult and hate speech against person on ground of their religion with regard to blasphemy religious insult and hate speech against person on the ground of their religion the state is responsible for determining what should count a criminal offence within the limit imposed by the case law of the european court of human right in this connection the assembly considers that blasphemy a an insult to a religion should not be deemed a criminal offence a distinction should be made between matter relating to moral conscience and those relating to what is lawful matter which belong to the public domain and those which belong to the private sphere even though today prosecution in this respect are rare in member state they are legion in other country of the world the assembly note that member state have the obligation under article of the convention to protect freedom of religion including the freedom to manifest one religion this requires that member state protect such manifestation against disturbance by others however these right may sometimes be subject to certain justified limitation the challenge facing the authority is how to strike a fair balance between the interest of individual a member of a religious community in ensuring respect for their right to manifest their religion or their right to education and the general public interest or the right and interest of others the

there is a need for specific supplementary legislation in the area of blasphemy religious insult and incitement to religious hatred the commission findsa that incitement to hatred including religious hatred should be the object of criminal sanction a is the case in almost all european state b that it is neither necessary nor desirable to create an offence of religious insult that is insult to religious feeling simpliciter without the element of incitement to hatred a an essential componentc that the offence of blasphemy should be abolished which is already the case in most european state and should not be reintroduced a concern the question of to what extent criminal legislation is adequate andor effective for the purpose of bringing about the appropriate balance between the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for one belief the commission reiterates that in it view criminal sanction are only appropriate in respect of incitement to hatred unless public order offence are appropriate notwithstanding the difficulty with enforcement of criminal legislation in this area there is a high symbolic value in the pan european introduction of criminal sanction against incitement to hatred it give strong signal to all part of society and to all society that an effective democracy can not bear behaviour and act which undermine it core value pluralism tolerance respect for human right and nondiscrimination it is essential however that the application of legislation against incitement to hatred be done in a nondiscriminatory manner in the commission view instead criminal sanction are inappropriate in respect of insult to religious feeling and even more so in respect of blasphemy the united nation human right council stated in it resolution combating intolerance negative stereotyping and stigmatization of and discrimination incitement to violence and violence against person based on religion or belief adopted on march the human right council express it concern that incident of religious intolerance discrimination and related violence a well a of negative stereotyping of individual on the basis of religion or belief continue to

respectful debate of idea a well a interfaith and intercultural dialogue at the local national and international level can play a positive role in combating religious hatred incitement and violence the un human right committee adopted at it nd session july the general comment no on freedom of opinion and freedom of expression freedom of expression is a necessary condition for the realization of the principle of transparency and accountability that are in turn essential for the promotion and protection of human right defamation law must be crafted with care to ensure that they comply with paragraph and that they do not serve in practice to stifle freedom of expression all such law in particular penal defamation law should include such defence a the defence of truth and they should not be applied with regard to those form of expression that are not of their nature subject to verification at least with regard to comment about public figure consideration should be given to avoiding penalizing or otherwise rendering unlawful untrue statement that have been published in error but without malice in any event a public interest in the subject matter of the criticism should be recognized a a defence care should be taken by state party to avoid excessively punitive measure and penalty where relevant state party should place reasonable limit on the requirement for a defendant to reimburse the expense of the successful party state party should consider the decriminalization of defamation and in any case the application of the criminal law should only be countenanced in the most serious of case and imprisonment is never an appropriate penalty it is impermissible for a state party to indict a person for criminal defamation but then not to proceed to trial expeditiously such a practice ha a chilling effect that may unduly restrict the exercise of freedom of expression of the person concerned and others prohibition of display of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system including blasphemy law are incompatible with the covenant except in the specific circumstance envisaged in article paragraph of the covenant thus for instance it would be impermissible for any such law to discriminate in favour of or against one or certain religion or belief system or their adherent over another or religious believer over nonbeliever nor would it be permissible for such prohibition to be used to prevent or punish criticism of religious leader or commentary on religious doctrine and tenet of faith law that penalize the expression of opinion about historical fact are incompatible with the obligation that the covenant imposes on state party in relation to the respect for freedom of opinion and expression the covenant doe not permit general prohibition of expression of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past event restriction on the right of freedom of opinion should never be imposed and with regard to freedom of expression they

or intimidate person belonging to religious or other minority and that they can have a serious inhibiting effect on freedom of expression and on freedom of religion or belief recommends that the

story wa based on life in russia in the film member of a gang called russia are filming propaganda video to post on the internet after a while they become accustomed to the camera and stop paying attention to it the leader of the gang discovers that his sister is dating a southern caucasian man this family drama develops into a tragedy the film ha no closing credit but a list of people killed

that included the impugned video see paragraph above fortyseven people who had also been added a the account friend had similar access see also paragraph and below later on the authority also examined

the dean of the faculty of social and psychological study and the deputy chair of the unit of stylistics and rhetoric on november they issued their report see paragraph below concerning the video they made the following findingsa linguist the video wa a part of a wellknown feature film russia and wa a selfcontained clip in term of it content it showed a negative encounter between an elderly woman and azerbaijani soured because of a lack of honesty and decency implying that azerbaijani vendor fooled their client and thereby putting forward a negative image of people of azerbaijani ethnicity the video did not refer to any specific person the negative image wa not personified thus the video showed a negative image of the entire ethnic group the video contained two call put forward by the elderly woman look maybe it is better to beat the shit out of all those blackies and to throw them throw them out of moscow well the holy cause is not tricky she take a bat in her hand the first two indirect call were strengthened by the last one emphasising the positive assessment of the suggested action a well a by the ensuing actual conduct consisting in the beating up of non russian people presumably of azerbaijani origin in view of the context of the video the last call here is how russian must fight for their right is demonstrated by the use of the word must and fight the expert concluded that the video contained a call to violence aimed at inciting discord between russian and azerbaijani a call to beat them with a bat a well a a call to violence aimed at violating their right a call to throw them out of moscowb psychologist the overall context of the russia film meant that it author aimed in the impugned part to show the tool and method of manipulative impact on the part of nationalist organisation and by implication to strengthen the protection of the individual and mass consciousness against such manipulation however when taken out of context that part acquired a different meaning by posting it a separate material that is to say without regard to and in isolation from the author intended message the person concerned pursued his or her own message the video created a negative image of people of azerbaijani origin by attributing to them deceitful and indecent action while omitting to make any disclaimer or reservation thus this image wa intended to relate to the entire ethnic group in opposition to a russian woman who could not be deceptive and thus had to stay away from the market taken over by azerbaijani the video then demonstrated the action to be taken namely physical assault against them and their removal from moscow such action were presented a positive and were approved of a a holy cause and the way russian had to fight for their right a to the audio they concluded a followsa linguist the content of the song opposed russian and non russian who were called blackies черные in modern russian this word wa used a a pejorative in respect of the people of certain race or ethnic origin asian black or from the caucasus they were presented in the song a enemy that russian had to fight against the nationalist tone of the song followed from the use of patriotic trope the fact that it wa directed toward russian the solicitation of the support of other slavic people the use of the notion of our kind the non russian were depicted a dangerous the song contained several call the blackie shit must be thrown out of russia the use of the word must come on guy let put on our bomber jacket and boot a call to get military clothing on let shout loud glory to russia and we will fight the expert concluded that the song contained a call to violence aimed at inciting discord between russian and non russian a call to fight against them a well a a call to violence aimed at violating their right a call to throw them out of russiab psychologist the message of the song author and the person who had posted it in the internet coincided the song contained a very negative depiction of non russian together with insulting and emotional adjective while omitting to make any disclaimer or reservation thus the content concerned all non russian ethnic group they were attributed a dominant position in russia thus the content wa aimed at inciting ethnic discord between ethnic russian and those of another ethnicity the content also contained expression calling for a fight to not give up and to win meaning violence against non russian with the aim of throwing them out of russia trial the applicant stood trial before a justice of

the applicant the court found a follows it is undisputed that in the summer of ku wa a public figure it is also undisputed that the article did not contain factual error thus each piece of information contained therein wa accurate the district court ha to ass whether the article included such insinuation that have been conducive to causing suffering or contempt or if it wa disparaging in other aspect the article covered the pretrial investigation of a homicide which had taken place a few day earlier a well a another largescale case concerning economic crime already pending before the

groundlessly with a contract killing violates his honour by combining information received and statement given by the head of the investigation and by mixing two different criminal investigation the article ha given an ambiguous picture of the connection between those case the heading and the information concentrating on kus personal profile had made ku the main common feature of the crime the district court find that in the article ku had been linked with a homicide in a manner that insinuated a connection between ku and the commission of the homicide and a contract killing such an insinuation violates kus honour and ha caused him suffering the district court wa composed of one professional judge and three lay judge one of the lay judge wa in favour of an acquittal in his

meeting of the judge of the paris tribunal de grande instance held in paris examined among other thing the situation of the judge m m it had been announced in the press that the minister of justice had referred to the conseil supérieur de la magistrature national legal service council a dossier concerning the church of scientology which she had been working on a investigating judge and in which certain shortcoming had been noted during that meeting a judge mr jm stated a follows we are not prohibited a grassroots judge from saying that we are friend of m m it is not forbidden to say that m m ha our support and trust on september the applicant and a fellow lawyer wrote a letter to the minister of justice in connection with the judicial investigation into judge borrels death they stated that they were complaining again to the minister of justice about the conduct of judge m and ll which wa completely at odds with the principle of impartiality and fairness they asked for an investigation to be carried out by the general inspectorate of judicial service into the numerous shortcoming which had been brought to light in the course of the judicial investigation they added that after the case had been withdrawn from investigating judge m and ll by a judgment of the indictment division of the paris court of appeal dated june all of the evidence had been transmitted to the new judge on june noting that a video recording made during an onsite visit by the investigating judge unaccompanied by the civil party wa not in the file thus transmitted the lawyer protested about this to the new judge on august they pointed out that the new judge had received that evidence on the same day and in their view this showed that judge m and ll had been sitting on this videocassette also forgetting to place it under seal for over a month after the case wa withdrawn from them they further stated that the judge on opening the cassette cover had discovered an envelope containing a letter addressed to judge m about which they commented that it content wa revealing and the literary quality of this letter wa such that it obliged them to reproduce it for the minister of justice in full especially a it came from the public prosecutor of the republic of djibouti mr d the letter read a follows salut marie paule je tenvoie comme convenu la cassette vidéo du transport au goubet jespère que limage serum satisfaisante jai regardé lémission sans aucun doute sur tfjai pu constater à nouveau combien madame borrel et s avocats sont décidés à continuer leur entreprise de manipulation je tappellerai bientôt passe le bonjour à roger sil est rentré de même quà jcdje tembrasse djama hi marie paule a agreed i am sending you the videocassette of the goubet site visit i hope the picture will be clear enough i watched the show without any doubt on tfi noticed once again how mr borrel and her lawyer were determined to carry on their manipulation ill call you soon say hello to roger if he back and also to jcdbest wish djama the lawyer continued their letter a follows the form and substance of the letter reveal moreover a surprising and regrettable complicit intimacy between the french judge and the djibouti public prosecutor a judicial authority placed directly under the government of which the head is very openly and very seriously suspected of being the instigator of bernard borrels murder this type of information is clearly capable of explaining the firm and constant determination of the investigating judge to stop the civil party and their lawyer from attending the reenactment held in djibouti a you are aware this particularly delicate case concern the death of a french judge and his widow herself a judge can not accept such conduct on the part of other judge in disregard of the most basic rule not only those of the procedure but also those requiring respect for the victim in those circumstance we are obliged to bring this matter to your attention to seek your assurance that all the shortcoming will be fully scrutinised the newspaper le monde published an article dated september entitled borrel case judge m impartiality called into question the journalist reported in the article that mr borrels lawyer had vigorously criticised judge m to the minister of justice it wa stated that the applicant and his colleague had accused the judge of conduct which wa completely at odds with the principle of impartiality and fairness and that the judge seemed to have omitted to register an item from the case file and to transmit it to her successor the article further stated judge m and ll had been sitting on this videocassette protest the lawyer olivier morice and also forgot to place it under seal for over a month after the case wa withdrawn from them the article continued a follows to make matter worse in the envelope judge p found a handwritten and rather friendly note by d the public prosecutor of djibouti the wording of the note found inside the cassette cover wa then reproduced in the article which added mr borrels lawyer are obviously furious this letter show the extent of the connivance which exists between the djibouti public prosecutor and the french judge exclaims mr morice and one can not but find it outrageous it wa then stated that the lawyer had asked the minister of justice to initiate an investigation by the general inspectorate of judicial service on and october the two judge in question lodged a criminal complaint for public defamation of a civil servant against the editorinchief of le monde the journalist who had written the article and the applicant applying to join the proceeding a civil party the defendant were committed to stand trial before the nanterre tribunal de grande instance by an order of the investigating judge dated october the complaint concerned the following passage of the article published on september she judge m is accused by lawyer olivier morice and ld of conduct which is completely at odds with the principle of impartiality and fairness and seems to have omitted to register an item from the case file and to transmit it to her successor judge m and ll had been sitting on this cassette protest olivier morice and also forgot to place it under seal for over a month after the case wa withdrawn from them to make matter worse in the envelope judge p found a handwritten and rather friendly note mr borrels lawyer are obviously furious this letter show the extent of the connivance which exists between the djibouti public prosecutor and the french judge exclaims mr morice and one can not but find it outrageous the court hearing took place on april and the judgment wa delivered on june the applicant first invoked the immunity provided for under section of the freedom of the press act of july the court rejected that argument finding that the action taken by the applicant and his colleague in writing to the minister of justice could not be regarded a connected to judicial proceeding or document adduced before a court of law within the meaning of section of that act the court then examined whether the comment at issue were defamatory it noted at the outset that this had not been meaningfully disputed and that the applicant stood by the content of his allegation that he considered well founded concerning the first passage the court noted that the quotation wa correct the letter to the minister having been included in the case file it added that the accusation of impartiality sic and unfairness proffered against a judge clearly constituted a particularly defamatory allegation because it wa tantamount to calling into question her quality her moral and professional rigour and ultimately her capacity to discharge her duty a a judge a regard the cassette it noted that the comment reflected at least some negligence in the handling of the judicial investigation and also cast doubt on the professional integrity of the two investigating judge it added that read a a whole the comment suggested that the cassette had only been included in the proceeding because it had been demanded by the lawyer then by the judge himself and that it had been necessary a it were to thwart and denounce a sort of obstruction on the part of judge m and ll it took the view that such assertion had to be classified a defamatory a they necessarily impugned a person honour and reputation within the meaning of section of the freedom of the press act a regard the last of the impugned passage the court noted that the defamatory weight of the term connivance wa the only aspect to have given rise to debate it noted that this term followed a number of other defamatory passage of which the highly negative wording and one can not but find it outrageous proved the deliberately strong connotation of the word connivance according to the court the use of that word clearly and directly suggested that on account of their good relation with the djibouti public prosecutor judge m and ll had been collaborating with that official of a foreign country in investigating the case in a partial and unfair manner in breach of the basic principle of law and of judicial office the court found that the defamatory nature of those view wa exacerbated by the subsequent indication in the article that the lawyer had asked the minister of justice to initiate an investigation by the general inspectorate of judicial service thus implying that they had a serious basis on which to substantiate such an accusation a to the applicant guilt the court noted that the law of july provided that a person supplying defamatory information to a journalist in the knowledge that it would be published could be convicted for instigation of public defamation the court noted that in the present case the applicant had confirmed at the hearing that he had spoken on the telephone with the journalist who had drafted the article and had made the comment a reported the court concluded that it wa established that the applicant had supplied information to a journalist of the daily newspaper le monde for the purpose of publication making comment of which the defamatory nature wa patent a to the applicant offer to bring evidence the court pointed out that in order to be admitted the evidence had to be perfect and complete and to relate directly to all the accusation found to be defamatory a regard the shortcoming in the judicial investigation the court noted that it wa still in progress and that the judgment of june had expressed disapproval with the refusal by the judge concerned to proceed with the reenactment requested by the civil party and had acted thereon by ordering the case to be withdrawn from them it took the view however that it could not be inferred that all the criticism made in open court about the handling of the judicial investigation should be regarded a founded a regard the retention of the cassette the court noted that no offer of evidence had been seriously made in order to establish any professional misconduct or dishonest conduct on the part of the investigating judge lastly a to the term connivance the court stressed that a possible convergence of opinion between participant in the judicial process without it precise extent having been determined did not in any way prove the existence of a culpable complicity with the aim of distorting the investigation procedure it concluded that the applicant had failed in all his offer to bring evidence in support of his good faith the applicant referred to the duty that were inherent in his mission of defending client and the result obtained in response to the request of the civil party since the withdrawal of the case from judge m and ll the court refused however to admit his defence of good faith finding that the highly virulent attack on the professional and moral integrity of the investigating judge clearly overstepped the right of legitimately admissible free criticism the court thus found mr morice guilty of instigating the public defamation of judge m and ll it sentenced him to a fine of euro eur and ordered him to pay jointly with the journalist and publication director of le monde eur to each of the two judge the court further ordered that an announcement be published in the newspaper le monde at their shared expense all the party to the proceeding appealed against that judgment the versailles court of appeal delivered it judgment on may it held that judge lls appeal wa timebarred and upheld the three conviction for defamation against judge m it increased the amount of the fine imposed on the applicant codefendant from to euro and to euro respectively however it confirmed the amount of the fine imposed on the applicant and that of the damage awarded and also the order to have an announcement published in le monde in a judgment of october on appeal by the applicant and judge ll the court of cassation finding that the reasoning wa inconsistent and that judge lls appeal wa not timebarred quashed the court of appeal judgment in it entirety it remitted the case to the rouen court of appeal which thus had to rule on the criminal and civilparty action against the three defendant in relation to judge ll and on the criminal and civil action against the applicant alone in relation to judge m after a number of adjournment the hearing before the rouen court of appeal wa held on april in it judgment of july that court looked again at the defamatory nature of the impugned comment a regard the conduct of judge m the court found that to say about an investigating judge that in the handling of a case she had shown conduct which wa completely at odds with the principle of impartiality and fairness or in other word conduct incompatible with professional ethic and her judicial oath wa a particularly defamatory accusation because it wa tantamount to accusing her of lacking integrity and of deliberately failing in her duty a a judge thus questioning her capacity to discharge those duty a to the delay in the transmission of the cassette the court noted that the applicant comment not only accused the judge of negligence in the handling of the case thereby discrediting the professional competence of the judge but above all implied that the latter had kept hold of the cassette after the case wa withdrawn from them with the intention at least of causing obstruction allegedly it wa only because the lawyer had raised the matter with p followed by that judge request to judge m that the item of evidence had been obtained and finally transmitted on august the court of appeal added that such assertion attributing to those judge a deliberate failure to perform the duty inherent in their office and a lack of integrity in the fulfilment of their obligation constituted factual accusation which impugned their honour and reputation it found this to be all the more true a the applicant referring to the handwritten note from the public prosecutor of djibouti had emphasised this atmosphere of suspicion and the negligent conduct of the judge by stating that this document proved the extent of the connivance between them and the prosecutor the court noted on that point that the word thus used implied that on account of those good relation judge m had been able to conceal the truth and conduct her investigation in a partial and unfair manner in breach of professional ethic and the fundamental principle governing the office of judge the court added that such an allegation accusing the two judge of a total breach of the duty inherent in their office represented in itself a serious attack on their honour and reputation it merely served to confirm the defamatory nature of the previous comment especially a the article added that the applicant had asked the minister of justice for an inspection by the general inspectorate of judicial service the court of appeal concluded that the offending passage characterised the offence of public defamation against civil servant a to the applicant offer to bring evidence the court of appeal referring in part to the argument of the court below took the view that none of the item produced showed on the part of the judge any unfair or partial conduct any failure to perform the duty inherent in their office or any lack of integrity in the handling of the case concerning the death of judge borrel it concluded that the veracity of the defamatory allegation had not been established a regard the applicant defence of good faith the court noted that he had referred to the duty that were inherent in his mission of defending client the result obtained in the case since the change of investigating judge and the judicial decision taken thereafter it found however that at the time of the article publication the highly virulent attack on the professional and moral integrity of the two judge in comment that seriously questioned their impartiality and intellectual honesty clearly overstepping the right to free criticism wa no longer of any procedural interest because the case had already been withdrawn from them the court found that the particularly defamatory comment made by the applicant in the press against the two judge revealed by their excessive nature the intensity of the conflict between him and in particular judge m it considered the comment to amount to an ex post facto settling of score a shown by their inclusion a the applicant had wished in an article published in le monde on september according to the court on that date the applicant could not have been unaware that the investigation division of the paris court of appeal had just begun to examine at his request a lawyer acting for the civil party the case of the church of scientology in which m a investigating judge in the case wa suspected of being responsible for the disappearance of document it concluded that this showed on the part of the applicant personal animosity and an intention to discredit those judge in particular judge m with whom he had been in conflict in various case thus ruling out his good faith consequently the court of appeal upheld the judgment of the court below found the applicant guilty of instigating the offence of defamation against a civil servant sentenced him to a fine of eur and jointly with his two codefendant awarded eur in damage to each of the civil party it also ordered the publication of an announcement in le monde the defendant and judge m lodged an appeal on point of law against that judgment the applicant relied in particular on article of the convention arguing that the immunity provided for in section of the freedom of the press act protected the lawyer in respect of any oral or written comment made in the context of any type of judicial proceeding in particular of a disciplinary nature it followed in his submission that the letter of september to the minister of justice for the purpose of asking the national legal service council conseil supérieur de la magistrature to take action against two judge who had been responsible for investigating the case in question fell within the context of the defence of the civil party interest accordingly in his view the court of appeal had not been entitled to refuse to grant immunity from suit in respect of the allegedly defamatory comment contained in that letter on the ground that it did not constitute an act of referral that could be covered by the term pleading in section of the abovementioned act on that point the court of cassation found that the court of appeal had justified it decision by taking the view that the fact of making public the letter to the minister of justice seeking an investigation by the general inspectorate of judicial service into the shortcoming attributed to the two investigating judge did not constitute an act of referral to the national legal service council and wa not part of any proceeding involving the exercise of defence right before a court of law the applicant further relied on article of the convention asserting that the impugned comment concerned a court case that had for a long time received medium coverage and the questionable manner in which the investigation had been conducted having regard to the importance of the subject of general interest in the context of which the comment had been made the court of appeal wa not entitled to find that he had overstepped the bound of his freedom of expression he contended that good faith wa to be assessed in the light of the impugned comment that had been published he added that the mere fact that he had had a disagreement with one of the judge in the context of another set of proceeding did not prove that he wa driven by any personal animosity lastly he argued that opinion expressed about the functioning of a basic institution of the state like the handling of a criminal investigation were not subject to a duty of prudence in the expression of thought the court of cassation took the view that the court of appeal had justified it decision while everyone had the right to freedom of expression and while the public had a legitimate interest in receiving information on criminal proceeding and the functioning of the court the exercise of those freedom entailed duty and responsibility and could be subject a in the present case where the admissible limit of freedom of expression in criticising the action of judge had been overstepped to restriction or sanction prescribed by law which constituted measure that were necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the reputation and right of others it dismissed the appeal by a judgment of november the bench which gave that judgment included in particular mr jm see paragraph above ii relevant domestic law the relevant provision of the freedom of the press act of july read a follows

the black box were photograph of at dg and ai and in a yellow box the phrase the investigator are at the heel of this trio they may have manipulated match for the bettingmafia diesem trio sind die fahnder auf den fersen e soll für wett mafia spiele manipuliert haben in the upper left corner a little box contained the following phrase terrible suspicion against football pro confirmed schlimmer vedacht gegen fussball profis erhärtet the main article on this subject written by the first and second applicant appeared on page the headline read a follows sold and betrayed the team for eur für

stuttgart area germany in one match which had ended with the result of against casino sw bregenz the goalkeeper at had made serious mistake a expected and another player ai had been replaced because of his poor performance dg had also been playing in that match the reason for the manipulation wa the player financial difficulty they had not received their salary for month they had all signed a public statement prepared by the management of the club denying their involvement in the betting scandal on the following page there wa an article under the headline a result shock a second time ein schockt ein zweites mal in which a football match of november wa reviewed again and it wa hinted that the poor performance of some of the player wa connected to the bettingscandal c the criminal proceeding on march at dg and ai filed a private prosecution privatanklage against the applicant before the feldkirch regional court they argued that the accusation raised in the article published by the applicant company in it newspaper on february that they had accepted bribe and manipulated football match wa particularly serious for a professional football player and his professional reputation this accusation which wa untrue constituted defamation and they requested the court to convict the first and second applicant of this offence they indicated in particular the following passage of the article a defamatoryi terrible suspicion against footballpros confirmed bregenz player bribed with eur schlimmer vedacht gegen fussball profis erhärtet bregenz spieler mit bestochenii sold and betrayed the team for eur für team verkauft und verrateniii bregenz player at dg and ai were bribed eur for their team to lose three match die bregenz spieler at dg und ai sollen bestochen worden sein damit ihr team drei spiele verliertiv regarding the third plaintiff at at had made contact with the croatian bettingmafia den kontakt zur kroatischen wettmafia soll at hergestellt haben they also claimed compensation from the applicant company for the harm caused and requested that the judgment be published in it newspaper on march the feldkirch regional court ordered the applicant company to publish within five day a short piece kurze mitteilung on the institution of criminal proceeding for defamation in respect of the article at issue on april the applicant commented on the charge against them they argued that they had only voiced a suspicion against the plaintiff but that in any event their statement were true or at least the first and second applicant had had good reason to believe that they were true which would rule out punishment between april and december the regional court held four hearing in the case in which it heard several witness inter alia ke a freelance journalist working for the third applicant newspaper and who had contacted two informant who had wished to remain anonymous and rh see above rh spoke about his contact with the s brother since may and stated that one of them f had contact in austria in particular the football club casino sw bregenz in his opinion two player of that team were in contact with f but he did not give any name or other detail on december the regional court found that the incriminated statement from the article of february amounted to defamation convicted the first and second applicant of that offence and sentenced them to a fine of eur and eur respectively suspended on probation for a probationary period of three year it ordered the applicant company to pay compensation of eur to each plaintiff and to publish an extract of the present judgment in it newspaper a regard the impugned article the regional court paid particular attention to it visual appearance which through it layout and presentation in particular the printing in white in a large black box conveyed to the reader the impression that the investigator were about to catch the pictured person who had filled their pocket with money by using dirty trick that first impression wa not mitigated by the small reference to a suspicion in the upper left corner the same wa true for the headline on page which read sold and betrayed the team for eur this wa a leading question which already contained the answer and again that first impression could hardly be mitigated by the use of the subjunctive in some phrase of the article itself the court therefore concluded that seen a a whole the article created the impression of being a statement of fact about the scandal and not a genuine expression of a suspicion the regional court therefore examined whether the accused had acted with due journalistic diligence when they considered these statement a true or if they could prove their veracity a regard the first element the regional court accepted that there wa a public interest in being informed on the question of whether or not player of the casino sw bregenz team had actually been involved in a betting scandal but found that the first and second applicant had not acted with sufficient professional diligence they had not personally conducted any research to verify the wellfoundedness of the rumour but had merely relied on the research of ke a freelance collaborator with the newspaper and had not checked the reliability of the source anonymous informant not known to them furthermore they had not given at dg and ai an opportunity to react even though there had been important new element going beyond a general suspicion of involvement in the betting scandal to which they had already reacted in the past namely that they had received a specific amount eur for manipulating three football match in the summer of turning to the proof of truth put forward by the applicant the regional court observed that dg and ai had only been accused by kes two informant x and y of being involved in the betting scandal and these informant had not given any detail nor stated that they themselves had witnessed a transaction also rh when heard by the court did not refer to them directly or indirectly there wa clearly no proof of the truth a regard at the regional court observed that he had lied when he stated that he did not know f that f had repeatedly visited bregenz and that there had been football match in which that player had given a very poor performance also the informant x and y had stated that at wa involved in the betting scandal these were argument speaking in favour of his involvement in the betting scandal but there were also argument speaking against it wa understandable that at had not admitted to knowing f immediately when all kind of suspicion were discussed in connection with the betting scandal a f wa one of the principal person involved in that scandal furthermore there wa only evidence that f had visited bregenz on various occasion between autumn and may whereas the football match which in the eye of the author of the article wa particularly suspicious had taken place in november according to the information given by x and y f had paid the three accused football player eur in summer for three match which had not yet taken place that did not coincide with his habit a described in detail by rh lastly the amount claimed by x and y namely eur wa not plausible given that casino sw bregenz had been at the very end of the national football league table in austria throughout the season of and the quota for bet on that team losing a match would have been so small that it would not have justified the investment of a considerable sum weighing all these element the regional court concluded that the applicant had not succeeded in proving the truth of the statement made in the impugned article a regard the compensation under section of the medium act the regional court found that the particular seriousness of the accusation raised and the adverse effect they could have on the career of a professional footballer justified the sum of compensation granted on january the applicant appealed against this judgment they argued that the impugned article did not contain a statement of fact but merely a suspicion against at dg and ai moreover the first and second applicant had fully complied with journalistic ethic a ke and the applicant had acted a a team there wa no need to check further the information received and at that stage of the investigation there had also been no need to give the plaintiff an opportunity to react to the information to be published on april the innsbruck court of appeal dismissed the appeal of the first and second applicant but partially granted the appeal of the applicant company and reduced the amount of compensation to eur for each plaintiff it found that the regional court had carefully weighed the argument and had arrived at a correct and wellreasoned judgment it agreed with the regional court that the first and second applicant had not reported on a mere suspicion but had presented their allegation a fact which they had failed to prove ii relevant domestic law if a publication in the medium viewed objectively constitutes defamation under section of the criminal code or an insult under section of the criminal code the insulted person may claim nonpecuniary damage against the medium owner pursuant to section of the medium act section of the criminal code in so far a relevant read a follows a it may be perceived by a third

31,the applicant are journalist at the relevant time they were employed by one of the two national television station in denmark danmark radio hereafter dr the first applicant produced a television programme described a a documentary called when the doctor know best which wa broadcast at pm on september and seen by viewer the second applicant wa the first applicant superior and responsible for the content of the programme the television programme concerned the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer notably at copenhagen university hospital rigshospitalet where consultant s wa in charge of treatment it focused on two type of chemotherapy medication alimta produced by l and vinorelbine produced by f copenhagen university hospital and s used vinorelbine a firstline treatment in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin depending on whether the treatment wa related to an operation operable patient or to prolonging life and relieving pain and symptom inoperable patient three expert participated in the programme a medical doctor from karolinska hospital in sweden a professor from switzerland and a medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany they all used alimta a firstline treatment most often in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin the programme followed four patient and their relative who told their story and a narrator spoke a a voiceover throughout the programme in preparation for the programme the first applicant had carried out research on the subject which included inter alia the following on september the european union had approved the marketing of alimta in combination with cisplatin for treatment of patient with inoperable pleural mesothelioma cancer the background for the approval wa among others research which had been carried out examining the effect of treatment with alimta in combination with cisplatin a compared to treatment with cisplatin alone a phase iii trial see paragraph below a firstline therapy in july the minister for internal affair and health replied to various question posed by member of parliament a to the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer in denmark the minister replied inter alia that there wa no proof that an alimtabased treatment wa more efficient than other chemotherapybased treatment including that offered in denmark that the combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin which wa used at copenhagen university hospital resulted in a oneyear survival rate of and a median lifetime of month which wa exactly the survival rate from using the combination of alimta and cisplatin but that there had been no direct comparison of the two treatment and that there wa no internationally accepted standard chemotherapy for the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer but that several single and combined treatment were used on june copenhagen university hospital produced a memorandum about pleural mesothelioma cancer and it treatment which wa sent to dr it stressed that international study including of vinorelbine and alimta had not shown that any twocombination regime wa superior to other twocombination regime that information wa confirmed by the professor from switzerland in an email of june and by the medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany in an email of june the memorandum also referred to a fund aimed at developing research on pleural mesothelioma cancer in the amount of danish krone dkk equal to approximately euro eur received by s from company f which produce vinorelbine the money had been used to pay nurse and student and for data collection it emerged that there had been no financial profit for the doctor involved having received the abovementioned memorandum the first applicant again contacted the professor from switzerland and the medical doctor at grosshandorf hospital in germany in essence they confirmed in subsequent email of and july that since there had been no direct comparative clinical study there wa no scientific evidence that one twocombination regime wa superior to another twocombination regime medical research study involving human subject are called clinical trial they are divided into different stage called phase generally it can be said that the earliest phase trial may look at whether a drug is safe or at it sideeffects a later phase ii trial aim to find out whether the treatment work well enough for which type of cancer the treatment work more about side effect and how to manage them and more about the best dose to use a later phase iii trial aim to test whether a new treatment is better than existing treatment standard treatment these trial may compare a completely new treatment with the standard treatment or with different dos or way of giving a standard treatment a the proceeding before the court subsequent to the broadcast on september of the television programme on october copenhagen university hospital and s instituted defamation proceeding before the copenhagen city court københavns byret against the director of dr and the two applicant maintaining that the latter in the programme in question had made direct and indirect accusation covered by article of the penal code straffeloven against copenhagen university hospital and s of malpractice regarding certain patient suffering from pleural mesothelioma cancer allegedly resulting in the patient unnecessary death and shortening of life in the interest of s professional prestige and private finance before the city court the applicant s and medical director h for copenhagen university hospital gave evidence the first applicant stated inter alia that she had not criticised copenhagen university hospital for improper treatment causing death her message wa only to point out that the substance of alimta had been better documented than the substance of vinorelbine she had collected statement from patient and expert but could not state herself whether alimta wa a better product than vinorelbine the expert had not stated whether alimta in combination with another product wa better than vinorelbine in combination with another product however all expert had emphasised that alimta had been evaluated in a phase iii trial for which reason it wa a more thoroughly tested product her question had been answered during her conversation with professor m on october and s on october subsequently no one had been willing to answer her question that wa the only real conversation she had had with s the next time she had called him he had put down the receiver when it had not been possible for her to get any response to her many point of criticism she had contacted h she had wanted statement from both h and s a the programme would be unbalanced if they were not heard some found that alimta had been better documented than vinorelbine she wa not aware of any trial demonstrating that a combination with alimta wa better than a combination with another medicinal product s stated inter alia the following alimta ha been used for secondline therapy in denmark since and since a firstline therapy patient had been given the impression in the medium that alimta wa a miracle cure therefore copenhagen university hospital had introduced it a an option today alimta is used in combination with carboplatin a the standard therapy for inoperable patient sometimes in autumn the standard therapy for operable patient had been changed to cisplatin in combination with alimta if some patient were offered alimta everybody had to be offered alimta after the programme had been broadcast patient started mistrusting the vinorelbine therapy afterwards it wa not possible to perform the trial phase ii on this drug nor would it be possible to obtain funding for the trial therefore no trial had been performed of vinorelbine he had provided the information included in professor m memorandum of september he had talked to the first applicant several time and had spent a lot of time and energy on explaining cancer therapy he had also lost confidence in the first applicant h stated among other thing the approval of alimta by the danish medicine agency for the treatment of mesothelioma only mean that a marketing authorisation ha been granted for the drug which mean that advertisement of the product is permitted vinorelbine ha also been approved by the danish medicine agency but for a wide range of oncological therapy in when alimta wa tested phase iii the bar had been set quite low the study compared alimta with a clearly inferior treatment that would not actually be offered to anybody it would have been more relevant to study alimta in combination with cisplatin versus vinorelbine with cisplatin s ha made a phase ii trial of the standard therapy vinorelbine subsequently the standard therapy regimen ha been expanded to include alimta which is not a better product than vinorelbine but eight time more expensive if two drug are equally effective but one of them is eight time more expensive than the other patient will be offered therapy using the cheaper drug the standard therapy now offered by copenhagen university hospital are vinorelbine in combination with cisplatin for inoperable patient and alimta in combination with cisplatin for operable patient the shift to alimta a the standard therapy at copenhagen university hospital did not reflect that alimta wa medically better the applicant programme had had a large impact a patient were asking not to be treated with vinorelbine copenhagen university hospital had therefore had to change medical product because patient had the clear impression that vinorelbine wa not a good a alimta it is quite usual for copenhagen university hospital to surrender material to the press and to answer question but the question of the first applicant were neverending copenhagen university hospital ha spent about a manyear or about dkk responding to inquiry from the first applicant and huge effort had been made to accommodate her request the programme had created distrust towards both copenhagen university hospital and s and had created uncertainty in both patient and relative he had received to hate mail himself by a judgment of april the copenhagen city court found against the applicant and the director of dr and sentenced them each to dayfines of danish krone dkk the allegation were declared null and void the reasoning wa a follows based on the evidence the city court accepts a a fact that in following a phase iii trial emea approved alimta in combination with cisplatin for treating patient suffering from inoperable malignant pleural mesothelioma and that subsequently the same wa approved by the danish medicine agency the court also accept a a fact that vinorelbine is a drug dating back more than year whose effect had been documented by clinical experience and approved by the danish medicine agency for a wide range of oncological therapy finally the court also accepts a a fact that it ha not been documented that alimta therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product is more effective than vinorelbine therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product a regard the term experimental drug the court accepts a a fact that a drug administered to patient in a trial is referred to a an experimental drug no matter whether the same drug is the standard therapy offered outside the trial setting no matter that the applicant are deemed to have been aware of the above circumstance following their comprehensive research of the matter it wa said in the programme that for dying patient s and copenhagen university hospital had prescribed a nonapproved chemotherapy regimen not approved for the diagnosis or which wa not the correct chemotherapy and that s and copenhagen university hospital used an experimental drug the worstcase scenario being that patient would die earlier than if they had been treated with an approved substance or that it would have fatal consequence moreover the phrase the only drug with a known effect wa used since no account wa given in the programme of the abovementioned trial and approval process and the terminology applied for that process the court find that it would seem to a nonprofessional viewer that alimta wa the only effective drug for mesothelioma particularly because the programme linked the treatment of two patient with vinorelbine to their death whereas the prospect of several more year to live wa held out to the one patient who had been given alimta therapy in germany moreover the programme also linked s use of vinorelbine to his personal esteem and his personal research account although the applicant had been made aware of the research grant management procedure though professor m memorandum of september before the broadcast since no account wa given either of the procedure for managing research grant the court also find in this respect that it would seem to a nonprofessional viewer that s had a personal financial interest in starting vinorelbine treatment rather than alimta the applicant are therefore considered to have violated article of the penal code according to the information on the applicant knowledge after their comprehensive research of the matter the court find no basis for exempting them from punishment or remitting the penalty under article of the penal code compare also article of the convention the applicant are furthermore jointly and severally liable for paying legal cost of dkk on appeal on june the judgment wa upheld by the high court of eastern denmark østre landsret with the following reasoning in the introduction to the programme when the doctor know best a narrator state among other thing a danish doctor is entering a medical congress to show his research result for year he ha gone his own way he ha treated dying patient with chemotherapy that is not approved later during the programme it is stated at which hospital one can receive treatment for pleural mesothelioma cancer that these hospital cooperate with copenhagen university hospital and a reference is made to a named consultant s head of the scandinavian centre for treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer during the various interview a narrator state inter alia the doctor doe not give his patient the only approved medication instead he us a test medication in the worst scenario that may result in the patient dying earlier than if they had been given the approved substance there is only one approved chemotherapy against pleural mesothelioma cancer but that is not offered to sp one of the patient followed in the programme the doctor chose to treat her with a substance that is not approved for the diagnosis and whose effect on pleural mesothelioma cancer is not substantiated however that chemotherapy turned out to have huge consequence for her sp s can freely choose the medication that he think is best there is only one treatment which in comparative study ha proved to have an effect on pleural mesothelioma cancer accordingly that is the only medication which is approved a treatment that medication is called alimta however s chose not to use that medication on his patient thus it ha not been proved whether vinorelbine work according to the calculation made by dr close to patient in denmark have been given test medication in the worst scenario that may result in patient dying earlier than if they had been given the approved medication for her sp the lack of effect of treatment by vinorelbine turn out to have had fatal consequence the family k ask themselves why s go his own way they suspect that he ha other interest than those of the patient that suspicion grows when they talk to sks personal doctor it turn out however that s may also have had other reason for choosing vinorelbine because he ha used this medication in medical test on the patient in a phase when they are fighting for their life the question remains why doe s carry out test with vinorelbine could it have something to do with the prestige which is implicit in having research article published we do not know whether it is prestige that impels s thus s will not acknowledge what leading expert agree on namely that alimta is the only medication whose effect is substantiated here it turn out that s ha received more than dkk over the last five and a half year from the company f that is the company behind the test medication vinorelbine the money ha been paid into s personal research account dkk is earmarked for the test s withheld that information the programme end by informing u among other thing that two of the patient who were interviewed have passed away the narrator say inter alia tj who wa part of s test with vinorelbine died on january with these statement the applicant not only passed on assertion by patient relative and expert but also took a stand so that the programme undisputedly gave the viewer the impression that malpractice ha occurred at copenhagen university hospital in that s ha deliberately used medication vinorelbine which is not approved for treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer and whose effect ha not been substantiated that the medication in question wa part of a test and that the test medication ha resulted in patient dying or having their life shortened the way that the programme is built up with it beginning and ending the viewer get the clear impression that the reason behind this choice of medication vinorelbine were s professional prestige and personal finance against this background in the programme the applicant a producer of the programme and a chief subeditor have made an allegation against copenhagen university hospital and s of malpractice and of nourishing irrelevant consideration to the detriment of the life and health of patient such an accusation is likely to disparage copenhagen university hospital and s in the eye of their fellow citizen a set out in article of the penal code it must have been clear to them the applicant that they were making such an allegation by way of their presentation of the programme the applicant have not attempted to establish the truth of the allegation but have submitted that the allegation shall be unpunishable by virtue of article of the penal code a they acted in lawful protection of an obvious public interest or the interest of others or in the alternative that punishment should be remitted under article of the penal code because they were justified in regarding the allegation a true these provision must in connection with article of the penal code be understood in the light of article of the convention on the protection of freedom of expression a very considerable public interest is related to journalistic discussion about risk to life and health or suspicion thereof a regard public hospital treatment when balancing consideration of freedom of expression with consideration of the protection of the name and reputation of person and company the former is accorded tremendous weight on the scale that entail acknowledgement of a very farreaching freedom of expression for the press and accordingly the press must be permitted a the public control and information organ public watchdog a certain amount of exaggeration and provocation in connection with their discussion of these question when factually there are reason for expressing criticism on the basis of the information in the case including the research material that the applicant possessed before the broadcast of the programme in particular the email from the medical doctor from grosshandorf hospital in germany and the professor from switzerland the reply by the minister for internal affair and health to various question posed by member of parliament and the memorandum of june produced by copenhagen university hospital about pleural mesothelioma cancer it can be established that vinorelbine in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin wa standard treatment at copenhagen university hospital that the european union on september approved the marketing of alimta in connection with cisplatin for treatment of inoperable patient with pleural mesothelioma cancer that there wa no substantiation or basis for believing that an alimtabased treatment wa more efficient than the treatment offered by copenhagen university hospital that some patient at copenhagen university hospital who were already about to receive vinorelbine a standard treatment were chosen and offered the same medicine a part of a test it is not known for what and that s did not make any private financial profit from these test against this background including the fact that the word approved wa not explained during the programme namely the difference between medication approved for treatment and medication approved for marketing and by consistently using the word test medication even though only one patient in the programme participated in test the applicant made allegation which were based on an incorrect factual basis of which they must have been aware via the research material the aim of the programme to make a critical assessment of the treatment of patient with pleural mesothelioma cancer offered by copenhagen university hospital and the responsible consultant is a legitimate part of the press role a public watchdog but it can not justify an allegation which is built on a factually incorrect basis and thus a wrong premise the applicant who did not limit themselves to referring to or disseminating statement by expert patient and relative did not have any basis for making such serious allegation against copenhagen university hospital and s the allegation can not be justified on the ground that copenhagen university hospital and s refused to participate in the programme against this background and since in relation to article there is no interest to protect when there is no factual basis for the accusation the allegation are not unpunishable under article nor is there any basis for remitting the punishment under article of the penal code it is an aggravating factor that the wrongful accusation were disseminated on national television during primetime and on drs homepage by mean of which the accusation had a significant spread accordingly the high court agrees with the copenhagen city court judgment that the applicant be fined under article and that the allegation be declared null and void by virtue of article the high court thus dismisses the appeal and upholds the judgment of the copenhagen city court the applicant shall be jointly and severally liable for paying legal cost of the high court appeal to copenhagen university hospital and s in the amount of dkk which constitutes the legal fee inclusive of vat in fixing the amount the high court took into account the scope and duration of the case on october the appeal permission board procesbevillingsnævnet

programme four complaint were lodged with the patient insurance association patientforsikringen relating to the issue raised by the programme a press release published on the association website on march read a follows a of today the patient insurance association ha received four complaint relating to the treatment of mesothelioma patient with combinatorial drug other than carboplatin and alimta that treatment wa questioned by the danish broadcasting corporation dr in a documentary programme in september the patient insurance association ha received four complaint relating to the criticism raised this mean that the person claiming compensation are either patient or their dependant one of the reason being their belief that the combinatorial drug administered to treat the disease were incorrect one all four complaint have been refused one of the reason being that the independent medical oncologist who assessed the case found that it wa in compliance with optimum medical standard to treat patient with the selected combination therapy two of the case have been appealed against to the national agency for patient right and complaint patientskadeankenævnet the national agency for patient right and complaint upheld the decision of the patient insurance association finding inter alia patient were offered carboplatin and vinorelbine which must be considered to be a active a other

32,the first applicant franz olivier giesbert is the publication director of the magazine le point the second applicant hervé gattegno is a journalist with le point the third applicant is the company operating le point a background to the proceeding at issue the proceeding against the applicant which form the subject matter of the three application are related to the event commonly referred to a the bettencourt affair mr liliane bettencourt principal shareholder of the group loréal is one of the richest individual in france from the late s she made numerous gift to her friend b a writer and photographer totalling several hundred million euro in value in december mr bettencourts daughter m bettencourt meyers filed a criminal complaint against b for the offence of undue influence abus de faiblesse with the public prosecutor at the nanterre tribunal de grande instance a preliminary investigation wa opened in that context numerous interview were conducted in particular with individual close to mr bettencourt and search were carried out in september b wa taken into police custody without waiting for the outcome of the investigation m bettencourt meyers brought a private prosecution against b in the nanterre criminal court on the same charge of undue influence she sought and obtained the inclusion in the case file of material and report from the preliminary investigation in september the public prosecutor office decided to discontinue the proceeding based on m bettencourt meyers original complaint the case initiated by the private prosecution wa first set down for hearing on september then on december on that date it wa decided to seek a medical assessment of mr bettencourt and the hearing wa deferred again to april for the subsequent criminal proceeding see paragraph and below mr bettencourt publicly announced that she wa refusing to undergo the assessment ordered by the court she also filed submission by way of voluntary intervention including in the alternative an application to join the proceeding a a civil party in the event that the prosecution wa regarded a valid by the court she argued that the aim of her civilparty application wa to persuade the court that her mental faculty were not diminished and that she had made her gift to b with all due lucidity the development in the case were widely reported in the press the offending article in le point were thus published in that context b the offending article the article of december on december the third applicant published with the second applicant byline a fourpage spread under the heading investigation into a very dear friend and with the subheading treasure did he take advantage of liliane bettencourt b denies it but the finger of suspicion point to him the article referred to various aspect of the case and in particular the very significant gift made by the heir of loréal for a total of one billion euro to b the journalist wrote quoting the testimony of liliane bettencourts former accountant she too describes the psychological domination imposed on an elderly lady who is more fragile than she may like he also inserted a passage from the prosecution document which summed up the situation a follows taking advantage of his influence and liliane bettencourts weakness b persuaded her at a time when her health wa declining to give him sum of money and asset going beyond token of friendship the article wa full of comment between inverted comma presented a extract from statement made to the investigator working under the public prosecutor it pointed out that the latter had discontinued the investigation in question among the quotation were explanation given by b when he wa in police custody in september and it wa claimed by the journalist that those explanation were often contradicted by the fact he swears that liliane bettencourt ha acted towards him like a patron their first meeting go back to the s but their friendship date from a portrait he made of her in i wa then sufficiently well off that i did not need financial assistance from mr bettencourt he retorted to the investigator i already owned five apartment on rue servandoni paris th a large collection of painting and had coownership of the brouzet estate a large estate in the gard together with copyright due and a commission on the sale by dior of the perfume poison after verification this inventory seems to be somewhat overstated in actual fact it wa through a series of cheque from the billionaire and the cancellation of astronomical debt to real estate company owned by him that b ha managed to build up his asset to the point of acquiring seven apartment in the welltodo neighbourhood of saint sulpice today the whole complex form a quaint townhouse with swimming pool cctv camera and secret passage between the bookshelf contradicted by the number and date the photographer wa forced to explain more humbly that mr bettencourt wanted him to expand in order to install all his work and perhaps set up a museum but curiously his benefactor did not even mention such a project during her own hearing on may b explanation she is a modest woman she will not say the thing that are in the depth of her heart the police investigation also demonstrates the lavishness of his property in the gard mr bettencourt did not contribute to it financing he claimed however the billionaire accountant testified that numerous cheque had been signed by her made out to contractor doing work on the estate for at least euro and a much a a cheque of million euro in december several employee testified that around the same time the old lady health had deteriorated herein lie the gravamen of the whole case wa the loréal heiress really aware of the extent of her generosity b declared that he had never seen the slightest impairment of her behaviour he even went a far a attributing to the octogenarian on record a remarkable intellectual agility moreover he willingly gave the police officer the name of other beneficiary who had received lavish gift but perhaps not for the same reason he nevertheless conceded the rest of his defence is even more audacious if he is to be believed liliane bettencourt enriched him against his will insisting that he accept gift which he tried to refuse i only knew about these gift when signing for them at the notary office he claimed in relation to the painting she ha given him when asked by the police whether the notary had expressed any reservation he replied no on the contrary the notary told me that the money came from mr bettencourts income and that she wa responsible enough to be in control of what she wa doing here again the reality is rather le clear the notary in question wa originally introduced to liliane bettencourt to deal with the photographer real estate acquisition then he replaced the family notary and all document relating to life insurance were transferred to his practice i no longer recall whether i knew him before he worked for mr bettencourt said b in an embarrassed semiconfession several employee say he wa behind her choice his protest that he wa disinterested are also at odds with a number of finding especially this answer liliane bettencourt gave herself to the police asked if her protégé had ever refused her generosity she replied no when the investigator confronted him with this answer the photographer wa forced to concede i have never refused gift that have already been recorded in notarial act thats a bit different in addition to these oddity there are two damning statement in the file those two statement are extract from the testimony of the former director of loréal once responsible for the management of liliane bettencourts asset and her former accountant the first spoke of a hold over mr bettencourt he had asked to be relieved of his duty because he testified i ran the risk of being complicit in the misdeed of mr b by my tacit consent the second witness referred to pressure on the part of the photographer and testified that he wa always asking for money in late her attention wa drawn to the proposed assignment of a life insurance policy for an amount in excess of million euro i tried to reason with mr bettencourt but she wa no longer her old self recalled the accountant i then bumped into b in the house and said to him youve seen the state she is in you know she is very ill he replied never mind a long a she is not under deputyship she can still sign the article also contained comment made by mr bettencourt on may in a box headed exclusive what liliane bettencourt told the police the journalist after quoting extract from the statement showing that mr bettencourt did not recall the agreement she had signed with b wrote that these memory lapse are clearly at odds with the picture that b would be painting of her to the same investigator in another box the journalist reported on the application for judicial protection filed by mr bettencourts daughter and quoted an extract from the report of neurologist pa who had been asked by the public prosecutor to examine the billionaire medical record revealing a state of vulnerability related to a probable degenerative neurological condition which impaired her individual faculty the article stated that from this episode and many others the financial brigade investigator in a report of december had concluded that there wa a series of sufficiently strong presumption that the offence of undue influence had been committed by b and that the photographer for his part had denounced an odious attack on a worldfamous artist it ended thus the court will rule whether the fortune passed to him by liliane bettencourt wa a windfall or a swindle either way it a masterstroke the article of february on february the third applicant published with the second applicant byline an article indicated on the full front cover of the magazine under the headline bettencourt affair how to gain one billion without any effort the subheading announcing the article read the unbelievable story of a society photographer who made a fortune by seducing liliane bettencourt the richest woman in france and the accusation of madam employee a photomontage showing mr bettencourt with her friend b also appeared on the cover the subject of the article which extended to eight page wa indicated a follows bettencourt affair ha the richest woman in france been conned by the photographer b some of her former employee have said a much to the police le point reveals their testimony and the secret of this incredible highsociety melodrama the article began a follows is it about money or sentiment a quarrel over an inheritance or a question of principle a settling of family score or the most perfect scam all of these thing put together perhaps and much more because the million slip away by their hundred in an atmosphere redolent of an agatha christie novel and a setting worthy of scott fitzgerald even the trial the inevitable epilogue will resemble a highsociety event on and april the court of nanterre will look into the incredible generosity for almost a decade of the richest woman in france towards the person she ha made her favourite the photographer b the article continued a follows since the billionaire daughter ha taken her case to the court accusing her mother protégé of the offence of undue influence ripple of disgust have been felt along the majestic avenue of neuilly and beyond the high society of paris in finance industry and politics concerned that it may one day be regretted that no one had seen anything or at least said anything for the investigation ha revealed the existence of lavish gift apparently totalling around billion euro could such rich pas unnoticed there a disturbing detail the largest sum were assigned to b in the spring of and in the summer of at a time when liliane bettencourts health wa declining sharply guru much testimony ha come to light since then le point is exclusively publishing several extract see the following page housemaid nurse secretary the chauffeur accountant all describe the hold that b had over the loreal heiress aged his own individual way of soliciting her generosity the equivocal aspect of his behaviour before the court the succession of these indignant employee will be reminiscent of the spectacle in the von bülow affair the trial of the libertine and cynical american aristocrat who wa accused in the early s on rhode island of poisoning his wife so that he could take over her fortune but even that scenario would not be the worst for b convicted at first instance von bülow wa nevertheless acquitted on appeal for the time being the photographer confronts the suspicion with sardonic contempt to make a work of one life thats what matter he proclaimed in le monde describing the charge against him a pathetic rumour his benefactor an intelligent woman who know how to choose men to take risk he told the police sweeping a little too quickly under the carpet the doubt about her state of health to be sure the heiress affirmed a year ago in le journal du dimanche that she wa attached to b and that she had no time for gossip she ha since shut herself away leaving her lawyer to speak in her place refusing any medical assessment and cutting short her appearance at reception or ceremony this silence ha only served to reinforce the impression of a woman under influence in the middle of the article under the heading exclusive the woman who accuse there were long extract over three page from statement of employee who worked at mr bettencourts house accountant secretary chambermaid nurse that had been given during the preliminary investigation the following statement were highlighted in particular it wa a if b had woven his web around mr bettencourt he answered me a long a she is not under deputyship she can sign b take advantage of madame weakness to benefit from her generosity after referring to remark by b and by mr bettencourt in the press the article added a number of statement paint a le idyllic picture under oath employee and servant mentioned pressing request for money going a far a harassment harsh language and various scheme bordering on the sordid under an intermediate heading strategy the article then mentioned and partially quoted document that had been discovered by the financial investigator at b home in paris the article ended with a small insert indicating that b had refused to respond to le point preferring to reserve his answer for the judge c the proceeding brought against the applicant following the publication of the impugned article the urgent proceeding brought by mr bettencourt application no on february following the publication of february mr bettencourt brought urgent proceeding against the applicant in the paris tribunal de grande instance claiming a manifestly unlawful nuisance under article and of the code of civil procedure she asked the urgentapplications judge to find that the reproduction of procedural document from the file of the preliminary investigation initiated by the nanterre public prosecutor breached section of the law of july on freedom of the press section which prohibited the publication of document from a criminal case file before they had been read out in open court and article of the civil code guaranteeing the right to respect for private life she requested that a courtordered notice be published in le point on pain of a coercive fine and that the applicant be ordered to pay her by way of an advance compensation for her nonpecuniary damage on account of her portrayal a an individual with diminished intellectual faculty who had been duped the applicant disputed mr bettencourts standing to bring the proceeding a prosecution in respect of the section offence could only be initiated by the public prosecutor under section of the same law on the merit they claimed that it wa contradictory on the one hand to require journalist to establish the veracity of the information that they published and on the other to penalise them for substantiating their investigation in a decision of march the vice president of the paris tribunal de grande instance found that mr bettencourt had standing in so far a she wa arguing that the publication of the impugned document had on the basis of that provision caused her personal damage the judge indicated that while section of the law reserved the prosecution of the section offence for the public prosecutor an individual who claimed to have sustained pecuniary or nonpecuniary damage a a result of a publication wa entitled to act a a civil party in the proceeding or to bring a case before the urgentapplications judge under article of the code of civil procedure in order to seek the requisite protective or remedial measure to put an end to the unlawful nuisance resulting from such publication or to request a sum by way of an advance the judge explained it suffices for the publication of the document prior to their reading in open court to have caused the person actual and direct damage regardless whether or not the person is a party to the proceeding in which the document are to be presented he ordered the applicant jointly to pay an advance of euro eur and the same sum in procedural expense under article of the code of civil procedure a to the application of section of the act the judge took the view that the statement by employee of mr bettencourt paragraph above constituted procedural document which were part of the preliminary investigation and that even though it had been discontinued those document had been joined to the criminal proceeding now pending after their transmission had been sought and obtained by m bettencourt meyers in support of her own private prosecution he added that those statement all helped the case for the prosecution a indicated on the magazine cover the accusation of madame employee and observed a follows the publication of long passage emanating from insider help to give the reported fact an appearance of authenticity and objectivity that the article doe not seek to nuance but on the contrary to reinforce the reader is thus led to regard those fact a proven because they are presented through the prism of a journalist analysis which is bound to contain a degree of subjectivity or opinion for those reason the alleged breach of section can not be combined with the breach under article of the civil code presumption of innocence or article of the civil code private life or section of the law of july defamation proceeding nor can it result in redress on the basis of those separate legal provision the judge concluded that the publication wa capable of infringing the right of mr bettencourt a it portrayed her at a time when the nanterre criminal court had not yet begun to examine the criminal case a a woman who wa manipulated and weak a description that she categorically denied the judge further found that the applicant were not justified in relying on the provision of article of the convention and the necessity of information in this connection he indicated that section sought mainly to preserve the independence and orderly conduct of the judicial process in addition to protecting the right of the person concerned particularly by guaranteeing the presumption of innocence he emphasised the limited and temporary nature of the restriction on freedom of expression a the legislation did not prevent analysis of or comment on procedural material or the publication of information gleaned from the proceeding themselves but only prohibited the reproduction of document which were intended for public disclosure in the context of a judicial process surrounded by safeguard these safeguard include respect for defence right and the principle of adversarial proceeding which could not be ensured by a prior isolated and partial medium report the judge went on to explain a follows the impugned restriction can not be compared to the case of disclosure of professional secret or of secret from the preliminary or judicial investigation on account of the possession by a journalist of document covered by secrecy and used in publication imparting information to the general public in so far a the journalist who is not bound by those secret is required to posse such document in order to justify the veracity of the fact reported or the seriousness of his investigation but also to use them in compliance with the applicable legislation all of the claim submitted by mr bettencourt alleging a breach of her privacy were dismissed on the ground that such a breach had not been sufficiently established having regard to the general public right to be informed and interest in being informed of current affair or event in the general interest the claimant ha not relied on any specific breach of her private life which would go beyond the information that it is permitted to mention in connection with the criminal case before the court of nanterre a le point did not in particular provide detail about any health problem she may have the applicant appealed they argued in particular that the procedural document in question which had been included in the case file solely on the initiative of the claimant and not on that of the public prosecutor could not be regarded a carrying the degree of authority which justified by derogation to the principle of freedom of expression the prohibition imposed by section they further emphasised that neither mr bettencourts right to a fair hearing nor any undermining of the authority or impartiality of the court wa at stake in a judgment of march the paris court of appeal upheld the decision of the court below in the main and raised the amount of the advance to eur in addition to charging eur for the cost of the appeal proceeding it confirmed that the witness statement clearly constituted procedural document even though the preliminary investigation had been discontinued since they had been transmitted by the public prosecutor at the request of the civil party and thus formed an integral part of the criminal proceeding in the court view the fact that they were transmitted at the request of the civil party and not on the initiative of the public prosecutor bore little relevance in this connection it concluded that the publication of long passage from those statement constituted a violation of section and thus an unlawful nuisance within the meaning of article of the code of civil procedure it added a follows the requirement for the journalist to verify his source and to compare the various material available to him on a given subject in the context of a serious investigation before imparting information to the public doe not mean reproducing verbatim the document used for his investigation where a in the present case such publication is prohibited under press legislation of which he can not be unaware the court concluded that the applicant submission that section should be declared incompatible with article of the convention wa unfounded it took the view that mr bettencourt wa entitled to claim nonpecuniary damage a she had been portrayed asa woman in a weak mental state being easy to manipulate and under the influence of b which the reader is all the more likely to regard a the truth a the observation are presented a emanating from individual who have played a particular role making them privileged observer of her private life lastly the court of appeal confirmed that there had been no breach of mr bettencourts privacy in the following term the mere mention of mr bettencourts mental health in the body of the article without any detail falling within her private sphere and in the testimony reproduced which wa mainly about the conduct and manoeuvre attributed to b doe not suffice to establish any particular breach of the respondent privacy that would go beyond the limit of legitimate information that the public is entitled to expect about a case which already being widely covered by the medium is before the court the applicant appealed on point of law in their ground of appeal they argued under article of the convention that they had a duty to inform the public about a case pending before the court which had been revived after a private prosecution following it discontinuance by the public prosecutor and which had given rise to wide medium coverage especially on account of the personality and wealth of mr bettencourt that the judgment of the court of appeal had found against them solely for publishing the statement extract and not on account of their content that there had been no impairment of the interest protected by section because mr bettencourt wa not the defendant in the proceeding that there wa a manifest contradiction in the court of appeal position a it had declared mr bettencourts action admissible on the basis of the damage sustained while taking the view that she had not been portrayed a a weak and manipulated woman in term of her right to respect for her private life in a judgment of april the court of cassation dismissed the applicant appeal and ordered them to pay mr bettencourt the sum of eur in cost it gave the following reason for it decision the judgment observes that long extract were published from the statement taken during the preliminary investigation in which mr bettencourt wa portrayed a a manipulated and weak woman proceeding with a correct application of article of the convention the court of appeal wa able without contradicting itself to conclude from that publication since the document drawn up by the police during an investigation are procedural document within the meaning of section of the law of july that mr bettencourt wa justified in claiming solely on the basis of that publication that she had sustained personal damage urgent proceeding brought by b application no on february b brought urgent proceeding against the applicant in the paris tribunal de grande instance following the publication of february arguing that it had caused him a manifestly unlawful nuisance infringing both his copyright to the photograph illustrating the article and his defence right including his right to be presumed innocent in a decision of march the vice president of the paris tribunal de grande instance in addition to endorsing the reasoning already set out in paragraph and above took the view that the impugned publication could have the alleged effect infringing b right to a fair hearing and his right to the presumption of innocence b claim concerning the infringement allegedly caused by the reproduction of photograph wa rejected a falling outside the remit of the urgent proceeding judge the judge ordered the publication of a notice inside the magazine together with an indication of it on the cover to take up one half of the page in bold type under the heading judgment against le point in proceeding brought by b and on the weekly magazine website the applicant were also ordered jointly to pay b an advance of eur on compensation for his nonpecuniary damage together with an equivalent sum by way of procedural expense the applicant appealed in a judgment of march the paris court of appeal upheld the decision appealed against mainly in the same term a those set out in paragraph above it reiterated that the witness statement without engaging in any extensive interpretation of section could be characterised a procedural document even though the investigation had been discontinued the fact that they were transmitted at the request of the private prosecutor and not on the initiative of the public prosecutor is of little relevance in this connection because they support the prosecution case it went on to find that consequently the mere publication of substantial extract from those statement before they had been referred to or read out in open court had indeed constituted a violation of section of the law of july and therefore an unlawful nuisance the court of appeal further found a follows the four statement thus presented to the public portray b a a devious and unscrupulous individual using seduction manoeuvre and psychological pressure to persuade liliane bettencourt to grant him substantial and frequent gift at a time when she wa weak and when her husband state of health had declined the reader is all the more likely to consider these statement to be true supporting a they do the accusation against b before the nanterre criminal court a they are presented a emanating from individual who a a result of the service they rendered to her nurse chambermaid secretary played a particular role through which they became privileged observer of her private life the reader is thus led to believe in the accusation even before the court hearing the case ha been able to reach it decision in condition that breach the respondent right to be presumed innocent and his defence right the applicant lodged an appeal on point of law in a judgment of july the court of cassation dismissed their appeal in the same term a those of it judgment of april see paragraph above proceeding on the merit brought by b application no on march b brought proceeding against the applicant on the merit before the paris tribunal de grande instance seeking redress for the damage sustained on account of the publication of the article of december and february in breach of section of the act in a judgment of june that court dismissed all of b claim on the admissibility of his suit it observed that the applicant were correct to assert that an individual who claimed to be the victim of the offence provided for under section of the act wa not authorised to bring a private prosecution on that basis it pointed out that by contrast the provision of that act did not preclude the injured party from bringing proceeding in the civil court a only one section of that act section prohibited the bringing of civil proceeding separately from a public prosecution namely in case of defamation against public authority state institution and civil servant after observing that section usefully contributed to preserving the orderly functioning and impartiality of the justice system and to guarantee due process since the full and verbatim publication of document from a criminal file before the trial could hinder the conduct of pending investigation or influence individual who might subsequently be called upon to testify or even lay magistrate who might have to adjudicate upon the case the court gave the following reason for it decision the prohibition that it establishes must not however restrict the ability of journalist to report on criminal case even those which have not yet been publicly examined by a court and specifically those which raising issue of general interest involving significant interest or concerning people with highlevel responsibility especially in political economic or artistic field particularly deserve to be brought to public attention the application of this legislation can not in particular have the effect of precluding journalist from imparting to their reader in such a case all or part of the documentary resource from which they derived their information in order to establish it credibility or which substantiate their commentary and analysis in order to submit them for open discussion this is the case here extract from report which have been drawn up by the police acting on the instruction of the public prosecutor and which have been appended after the discontinuance of the proceeding for which they were produced to the file of further proceeding brought directly by a civil party in a criminal court those extract therefore were included by the second applicant in two successive article which were each the result of a journalistic investigation and sought to present reader with information analysis and comment on a criminal case that would soon be adjudicated upon by a court that involved considerable financial interest and concerned one of the richest individual in france and a photographer and writer who ha a he himself boast undeniable success and notoriety in the first of the impugned text short quotation from procedural document which are reproduced in quotation mark in the body of the article and are therefore fully integrated into the journalist writing mention certain fact and offer an analysis thereof in the second text the three page of extract from procedural document are included in a broader editorial presentation consisting essentially of a fourpage spread and a large photograph of the person concerned from which they are indissociable the journalist expressly refers to those extract in his article analysing them and basing his conclusion on them if one were to accept in those circumstance that these two body of text should be examined by this court only on the basis of the strictliability offence under section of the freedom of the press act that would lead a the respondent rightly argue to preventing them from initiating the debate that is warranted by the journalist work within which the impugned extract are merely one element and they would be deprived in the present case of the defence made available by law to person who are prosecuted for defamation or for a breach of the right to be presumed innocent in other word precluding them from proving the veracity of the allegation or at least the journalist good faith and from submitting argument to the effect that the impugned text do not contain any final conclusion expressing a biased view that the person in question is definitely guilty it should be noted in this connection that the claimant directs his main criticism in his writ of summons against the comment and analysis that the journalist ha been led to write under his own name by the procedural document cited and that he mainly reproduces in that writ only those comment and not the quotation that he is supposed to be challenging it should be observed in particular that the claimant complains that the statement from which extract were quoted or in reality the journalist analysis thereof breached his right to be presumed innocent and were presented a damning and particularly incriminating it can be concluded that b himself admits that absent his chosen basis of action he had other option at his disposal a private prosecution or civil proceeding for defamation or a civil action for a breach of his right to be presumed innocent both of those course of action would have entailed fair proceeding ensuring respect for the equality of arm and he wa not therefore deprived of his right to have access to a court in order to secure respect for his right in those circumstance the upholding in the present case of the claim that he ha submitted under would constitute a restriction of freedom of expression devoid of any necessity in a democratic society in a judgment of february the paris court of appeal overturned that judgment it found that the impugned publication infringed b right to a fair trial with respect for his defence right including the right to be presumed innocent and breached section of the act it ordered the applicant jointly to pay b the sum of eur for each publication by way of compensation and eur in expense under article of the code of civil procedure it also ordered the publication on pain of a coercive fine of a notice containing the operative provision of the judgment in le point and on the magazine website the court of appeal explained that the assessment of the offending publication clearly went beyond the framework of that of socalled procedural offence and that it would have to be carried out with regard to article of the convention and to the question whether the interference with the applicant freedom of expression wa necessary to protect the reputation or right of others and to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary a regard the article of december the court noted that it had been published the day before b appearance in the criminal court and that it clearly suggested that he wa guilty a he wa portrayed a an individual against whom there wa a series of sufficiently strong presumption that he had committed the offence of undue influence it took the view that the court below had wrongly regarded the aim of informing the public a prevailing over the mean used namely illegal method whereby extract had been selected from statement collected in an investigation in order to show that b had committed the offence of undue influence whereas there had been no judicial decision to that effect it could be understood by the reader that b wa not telling the truth about mr bettencourts mental health and that his guilt wa doubly suggested in the introduction citing an extract from the prosecution document which fell under section and in the conclusion it added a follows the reasoning given by the court below is tantamount to legitimising the practice which is legally prohibited of publishing extract from an investigation file before they are read out in open court first on account of the interest of the subject and secondly while noting b claim that his right to be presumed innocent wa breached the court can not agree with the reasoning of the court below the article of december in so far a it portrays b a having committed the offence of undue influence visàvis mr bettencourt in the abovementioned context clearly breach his right to a fair trial including to the presumption of innocence that breach according to the article is exclusively based on the publication of extract from statement which legally speaking are not addressed to journalist when they are not party to the proceeding the court would reiterate that for a reader who ha an average knowledge of the court document from judicial investigation take on particular credibility and an undeniable evidential value the court reach the conclusion that the date of publication the choice of quotation and the portrayal of b a guilty according to the document from the judicial investigation even though it had been discontinued had the consequence of influencing his exercise which wa legally and conventionally guaranteed of his defence right which meant that before being heard by a court he should not have been portrayed a guilty of the offence of undue influence against mr bettencourt b thus find himself required to give explanation on evidence against him which ha not yet been debated in a court of law and which ha been taken from an investigation then still secret conducted under the supervision of a judge it is not befitting to consider a did the court below that b had other course of action available to him being entitled to bring his case to the civil court under section it can not be suggested to the claimant that he should have opted for other type of proceeding on the erroneous ground that his action contravenes article of the convention a regard the article of february the court of appeal took the view that the editorial choice front cover of the magazine presentation of whole swathe of statement highlighting of the exclusive publication of the witness statement constituted a communication of some importance directly aimed at b who had not been able to explain before a court his position on the accusation of the staff it added that the publication portrayed b a being accused by third party in conclusive term and that the article wa a repeated incrimination of b two month before a hearing at which the epilogue of the case wa supposed to take place the applicant appealed on point of law in their ground of appeal they argued in particular that the ban on publishing procedural document wa a matter of defence of the general interest falling within the sole jurisdiction of the public prosecutor and that a private person could not seek redress for damage on that basis they added that their argument wa supported by the fact that b could have under article of the civil code used another legal remedy to ensure the protection of his interest and that the interference with freedom of expression and of information had therefore not been justified or proportionate in a judgment of may giving the following reason the court of cassation dismissed the applicant appeal having found first that the article of december wa based on an analysis of extract from various statement taken by the criminal investigation police in order to portray b a having taken advantage of mr bettencourts weakness the day before his appearance before a criminal court which wa to rule on the relevance and merit of the accusation made against him by her daughter and secondly that the article of february based on a partial reproduction of statement taken by the criminal investigation police seeking to portray b a being accused by third party in conclusive term in order to lead the reader to believe that the case against him wa made out two month before a hearing which would constitute according to the article the epilogue of the case the court of appeal reached the conclusion that the publication had infringed b right to a fair trial with due respect for his right to be presumed innocent and his defence right d development in the bettencourt affair since the publication of the offending article after june there were many development in the case with it various political and financial repercussion and they were widely reported in the medium on november the court of cassation ordered the transfer of all the aspect of the bettencourt case to the bordeaux tribunal de grande instance mr bettencourts daughter withdrew her claim but the criminal proceeding were later resumed and on december b wa placed under judicial investigation for the offence of undue influence in a judgment of may b wa found guilty of that offence and sentenced to three year imprisonment of which six month were suspended a fine of eur and the payment of eur million in damage awarded to mr bettencourt in a judgment of august the bordeaux court of appeal upheld the judgment in respect of the prosecution case and varied the sentence giving b a fouryear suspended prison sentence fining him eur and ordering the confiscation of part of his property the court of appeal also took the view that it did not need to make an award of damage on account of settlement that had been agreed between the party iii relevant

33,in and life in gilserberg she wa represented by m g pahl a lawyer practising in hamburg the government were represented by one of their agent m n wenzel of the federal ministry of justice and consumer protection the fact of the case may be summarised a follows background to the casethe applicant political activity from until early the applicant wa a member of the political party the republican die partei der republikaner the party is generally considered to be rightwing and ha been under scrutiny by the office for the protection of the constitution verfassungsschutzämter in various german länder it ha not however been declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court under article of the german basic law for earlier case concerning member of that party see otto v germany dec no november and erdel v germany dec no february the applicant sat on the schwalm eder district council kreistag and stood for election to both the federal parliament bundestag and to the parliament of the land of hesse landtag on behalf of that party in march the applicant wa elected to the district council on behalf of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance bürgerbündnis pro schwalm eder and served in that role until her resignation in late the domestic court established that several member of that alliance board a composed at that time had link with organisation of the extreme right see paragraph and below in addition to her membership in and activity on behalf of these party and organisation the applicant expressed herself publicly at political rally and in lecture and interview over the year the applicant employment a a teacher the applicant trained a a teacher for lower secondary school passing her first and second state exam in and she exercised this profession for limited period and at irregular interval in the academic year she worked at a public secondary school in eltville in the land of hesse on a fixedterm contract she received a positive appraisal report for that academic year and in the academic year she again worked at the same school on a fixedterm contract in a letter of march the competent authority terminated the applicant employment contract with immediate effect citing doubt a to her loyalty to the constitution verfassungstreue in early april the hesse ministry of culture notified all public education authority in hesse that the applicant employment contract had been terminated on the ground of significant doubt a to her loyalty to the constitution and asked to be notified immediately if the applicant applied for another post the applicant brought an action against the termination of her employment contract before the wiesbaden labour court those proceeding ended with a friendly settlement concluded on may which read the employment contract will be terminated upon expiry of the fixed term specified therein that is on july the applicant will remain entitled to remuneration until the termination date but will be released from her work duty the party hereby agree that an offer of employment issued in february will be deemed null and void the land against which the action wa brought hereby undertakes to delete from the personnel file any mention of the dismissal the applicant will receive a favourable appraisal report which specifies the date of termination a july that appraisal report wa issued on august and any mention of the dismissal wa deleted from her personnel file the applicant inclusion on the authority list in an email of may the hesse ministry of culture asked the darmstadt public education authority schulamt to ensure through the centralised office for the management of teaching personnel that the applicant would not be included on any shortlist of potential teacher for public school in hesse in late the hesse ministry of culture in cooperation with the decentralised hesse public education authority decided to set up a list containing information regarding teacher deemed unsuitable for reappointment to a teaching post at a school the list the list wa maintained by the centralised office for the management of teaching personnel in hesse and access wa restricted to ten individual working at that office a well a to two individual at each of the fifteen decentralised hesse public education authority in the event that they received a job application education authority in other german länder and private school in hesse did not have the right to inspect the list and it would have been unlawful to transmit any information in the list to them according to the notification by the hesse ministry of culture the fact that the name of a job applicant appeared on the list did not obviate the need to examine his or her suitability in each individual case public education authority in hesse seeking to recruit thus retained the discretion to make their own decision a to the suitability of a job applicant included on the list by a letter of december the applicant wa notified that her name had been included on the list the list entry concerning the applicant read noninclusion in the shortlist reason attributable to the person the proceeding in issue on december the applicant requested that her name and information about her be deleted from the list by a letter of january the competent authority rejected the applicant request the applicant brought an action which in a judgment of august the darmstadt administrative court dismissed a illfounded finding that the applicant wa not entitled to have her name deleted from the list her inclusion and retention on the list and the processing of the information relating to her had a legal basis in section of the hesse data protection act in conjunction with section d and g of the hesse civil servant act see paragraph below the provision of the latter act applying mutatis mutandis to state employee who were not civil servant there wa sufficient evidence both at the time of her inclusion on the list and at the time of the administrative court judgment that the applicant wa not committed to the free democratic constitutional order freiheitlichdemokratische grundordnung in every aspect of her conduct contrary to the requirement of section second sentence of the collective agreement for public service in hesse tarifvertrag für den öffentlichen dienst de landes hessen see paragraph below the administrative court found that the respondent authority had acted within it margin of appreciation when it had concluded that there were serious doubt a to the applicant loyalty to the constitution and that she wa unsuitable to work a a teacher at a public school in hesse indeed it could not be taken for granted that the applicant would uphold the free democratic constitutional order at all time or that she would convey the basic value and principle of the constitution to her pupil in a credible manner observing that political engagement for an organisation that wa hostile to the constitution could be a relevant factor even if the organisation concerned had not been declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court under article of the basic law the administrative court considered that the applicant had been an active member of the republican from to early and had represented that party a a member of the schwalm eder district council and a a candidate in election at both the federal and land level this membership and these activity in the republican a party in respect of which there were manifold indication that it wa not committed to protecting in particular the dignity of foreigner and asylumseekers living in germany could serve a a first indication that there might be doubt a to the applicant loyalty to the constitution her letter of january to the party hesse leadership in which she had declared that she wa ending her party membership reinforced these doubt her primary motivation for her withdrawal from the party had been that she did not share the concern expressed by the party leadership about cooperation with member of the national democratic party of germany nationaldemokratische partei deutschland npd who had stood for election to the district council a part of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance in that letter the applicant had displayed an attitude that wa very critical of the german state a evidenced by her statement that there wa no risk of that alliance abolishing the free democratic constitutional order a such order had ceased to exist a long time ago and that she would make every effort to reinstate a free order deliberately omitting the word democratic her activity on behalf of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance were an important element for assessing the question of doubt a to her loyalty to the constitution several member of that alliance and in particular the member of it board including fr had link to extremeright organisation notably to the npd and neo nazi group and had become known for their extremist opinion the applicant could not successfully claim that the opinion of the alliance other member could not be attributed to her given that she had chosen to run for the march election to the district council and to serve a a member of the district council on behalf of that alliance until her resignation in late doubt a to the applicant loyalty to the constitution also followed from her appearance at political rally of inter alia a youth organisation of the extreme right and her interview with the npd magazine die deutsche stimme german voice she had engaged in such activity in but also a late a april when she had spoken at a rally of the russian german conservative stating that sixty year after the war we still bow to what the victor decreed and accept halftruths and lie about our own people her appearance at event of the silesian youth thuringia or the young witikons group were similarly characterised by aggressiveness towards state institution while she could legitimately object to kin liability in respect of the political view of her husband who had been described a an american neo nazi previously belonging to an important extremeright organisation in the united state of america and who had served a the district chairman of the npd since the similarity in political view wa evident from the fact that four member of the family including the applicant had run a candidate for the district council election in on behalf of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance the applicant had never distanced herself from her past political activity but had merely declared that she did not intend to be politically active in the future the administrative court considered that at the time of it judgment this wa insufficient to dispel the doubt for the purpose of a forwardlooking assessment a to her loyalty to the constitution which had justifiably arisen following year of political activity she could legitimately be expected to explicitly express her commitment to the free democratic constitutional order and to declare that she did not support movement pursuing contrary aim or in the alternative that she had turned away from such movement after having previously supported them however rather than doing so the applicant had defended her activity and merely stated that she did not pursue aim that were hostile to the constitution observing that her retention on the list meant that the applicant for the time being de facto had no possibility of being hired a a teacher at a public school in hesse the administrative court considered that this did not constitute an unjustified interference with her freedom of profession berufsfreiheit under article of the basic law in view of the importance of protecting the constitutional order and the risk that a teacher who opposed that order could abuse his or her role of educating the child entrusted to him or her the authority were allowed to question the teacher loyalty to the constitution even if there had not yet been any workrelated reproach application by the applicant for a teaching post at private school in hesse or at school in other german länder were not futile a access to the list wa limited to the hesse authority and could not be transmitted to other authority for reason of data protection lastly the applicant inclusion on the list wa not in conflict with the friendly settlement concluded in see paragraph above a that did not prevent the authority from continuing to doubt the applicant loyalty to the constitution and seeking to prevent her reappointment a a teacher at a public school in hesse on september the applicant requested leave to appeal the administrative court judgment submitting that she wa not unsuitable to work a a teacher and that the judgment had breached her freedom of opinion under article of the basic law and her freedom of profession under article of the basic law she argued that not a single school in germany would hire her a a result of her inclusion on the list which had a stigmatising effect she had always strictly separated her political activity and her work a a teacher and there had never been any detrimental effect on her work a a teacher a also evidenced by the positive appraisal report she had received her previous membership in and activity on behalf of the republican were not in themselves sufficient to question her loyalty to the constitution nor did these activity or those on behalf of the pro schwalm eder civic alliance render her unsuitable to work a a teacher political view held by other member of that alliance could not be attributed to her a a member of the district council from which she had resigned in late she had never made any statement that were hostile to the constitution xenophobic or extremist she did not intend to pursue any political activity in the future neither the russian german conservative nor the silesian youth thuringia or the young witikons were deemed to be hostile to the constitution or being monitored for that reason reference to her husband were inadmissible she could not be required to distance herself from her prior political activity also bearing in mind that she did not aim to become a civil servant and that a lesser degree of loyalty wa required from public employee who were not civil servant lastly her retention on the list wa in breach of the friendly settlement reached in in which the authority had undertaken to remove the dismissal notice from her personnel file this also meant that doubt a to her loyalty to the constitution could not be based on her past political activity by an order of september the hesse administrative court of appeal dismissed the applicant request for leave to appeal a illfounded finding that there were no serious doubt a to the correctness of the administrative court judgment a regard the compatibility of the impugned measure with the applicant freedom of profession under article of the basic law the court considered that the applicant wa unsuitable for a teaching post at a public school in hesse and that the measure which aimed to prevent her reappointment to such a post wa proportionate in view of the public interest at stake it wa true that not all employee working in public service arbeitnehmer im öffentlichen dienst were per se subject to an enhanced obligation of loyalty to the constitution comparable to the one imposed on civil servant beamte rather the extent of their obligation of loyalty depended on their position and the task they performed which meant that teacher were subject to an enhanced duty of political loyalty which wa equivalent or came close to the one placed on teacher who were civil servant teacher had to teach the child entrusted to them in a credible manner about the basic value of the constitution child and adolescent in public school should recognise that freedom democracy and the rule of law were value worth upholding a teacher who did not relate positively to the basic value and principle of the constitution wa unable to convince his or her pupil that democracy wa worth defending moreover there wa a risk that such a teacher would sway his or her student against the basic value of the constitution pupil were wholly at the mercy of the teacher influence the role played by teacher wa therefore one of enormous significance from a publicpolicy perspective the administrative court of appeal added that standard differed depending on whether the matter concerned the termination of an existing employment contract or a in the present case potential reappointment to a post whereas general doubt a to the individual loyalty to the constitution were not sufficient to justify the termination of an existing employment contract such general doubt were sufficient to justify the decision not to recruit an individual with the employer enjoying a margin of appreciation in the applicant case there were sufficient general doubt a to her loyalty to the constitution the existence of workrelated reproach or detrimental effect on her work a a result of her political activity wa therefore not required and the applicant submission a to her positive appraisal report and her separation of professional and political activity were beside the point in respect of the existence of such general doubt a to the applicant loyalty to the constitution and her challenge of that assessment the administrative court of appeal in essence repeated the ground given by the administrative court see paragraph above the administrative court of appeal added that the pro schwalm eder civic alliance had been deemed hostile to the constitution and that the applicant had voluntarily chosen to run a the alliance top candidate in the election to the district council a such she could not legitimately avoid being identified with the political aim of the alliance other member and candidate it also reiterated that membership in and activity on behalf of party and organisation that were hostile to the constitution such a the one with or on behalf of which the applicant had voluntarily and actively engaged wa a relevant aspect in the assessment of doubt a to loyalty to the constitution in the context of the person potential employment even if the respective party or organisation had not been declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court under article of the basic law having regard to the foregoing and to the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the land in question in relation to applicant for employment the administrative court of appeal concluded that there were objective ground for that land to seek to prevent the applicant employment a a teacher at a public school in hesse in these circumstance including the applicant on the list wa not disproportionate to the aim pursued the applicant inclusion on the list provided any of the decentralised public education authority with an effective opportunity to examine existing reservation a to the applicant appointment in a potential future recruitment procedure no more lenient equally suitable measure could be discerned access to the list wa heavily restricted which limited the severity of the interference with the applicant right access wa restricted to ten individual within the centralised office for the management of teaching personnel in the land of hesse which administered the list a well a to two individual at each of the decentralised public education authority in hesse the list wa for internal use only and the information contained therein wa not transmitted beyond the said authority in hesse notably neither private school in hesse nor authority in other länder had a right to inspect the list the impact of the applicant inclusion and retention on the list wa therefore limited to making it more difficult or preventing her appointment at a public school in hesse it did not negatively affect the applicant chance of employment at public school in other länder or at private school in hesse there wa no reason to believe that her job application at a private school in hesse and at a public school in another land had been unsuccessful because of her inclusion on the list contrary to what she had alleged given that the relevant employer did not have access to it it wa much more likely that her application had been unsuccessful for other reason or that her political activity and public appearance had led to her being publicly known in so far a the applicant had invoked the friendly settlement of may that agreement did not feature any undertaking in respect of a future reappointment of the applicant at a public school in hesse nor an undertaking that the circumstance which had led to the applicant dismissal would not be considered in connection with her potential reappointment lastly even assuming that the impugned measure constituted an interference with the applicant right to freedom of opinion under article of the basic law such interference wa not disproportionate in view of the enormous importance of and public interest in educating child in a credible manner about the basic value of the constitution on october the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint which the federal constitutional court decided not to accept for adjudication without providing reason decision no bv r of may the decision wa served on the applicant on june the applicant political activity after in their observation the government submitted that the applicant had continued to engage in political activity for the extreme right contrary to what she had submitted before the domestic court by way of example they referred to a lecture given in barcelona in entitled inge godenau la democracia manipulada during the talk a flag of the npd had been on display and a member of the audience had been wearing a tshirt with a slightly modified swastika the promotional material for the event had described the applicant a belonging to a family of militant and founding member of the npd the government pointed out that a simple internet search of the applicant name brought up a large number of online post letter and speech expressing extremist opinion some of which could engage criminal liability with her contribution covering topic such a her nonrecognition of poland national border her criticism of the presentation of historical event in school textbook and allegation that the press wa lying the government submitted example of the applicant statement to the court including the following id be remiss to end my post without referring to the brutal regime which allegedly murdered million of jew and wa responsible for million more death during the second world war researcher do not by any mean share a single opinion a regard the former and a regard the latter it is now commonly accepted that germany neither planned nor wanted to go to war another statement by the applicant wa to the effect that germany had no constitution since a portion of the population remained under polish administration the opinion of the entire german people on the matter had not been sought the applicant did not dispute that she had made those statement relevant legal framework and practice the relevant provision of the basic law grundgesetz read a follows article everyone shall have the right freely to express and disseminate

34,the applicant wa born in and life in pirna the applicant had been employed a head of the subdivision in charge of sanctioning misuse of housing property zweckentfremdung in the housing office of the municipality of dresden since on december a meeting of the staff of the housing office took place in the presence of the deputy mayor for economy and housing w an elected official who inter alia governed the housing office and of a number of staff and trade union representative following a short address on the issue of the expiry of the regulation on misuse of housing property by december given by w the applicant took the floor and accused w of having committed perversion of justice rechtsbeugung by ordering the issue of an unlawful demolition permit for a block of flat in on december the applicant head of division requested the applicant to substantiate his allegation in writing on december the applicant submitted several page of written comment in which he repeated several time using bold character his allegation that w had committed perversion of justice by ordering the issue of a demolition permit in without at the same time imposing compensation payment for the loss of housing space caused by the demolition according to the applicant w had ruthlessly pursued politicoeconomic interest he further submitted that all staff member of his subdivision considered that w had deliberately discredited their work furthermore w had unlawfully attempted to dissolve the subdivision thus putting at risk it staff employment the statement made by w during the staff meeting had been degrading and cynical and had contained halftruths and lie w had not assumed any personal responsibility and did not show any concern for finding a socially acceptable solution to the problem arising from the dissolution of the subdivision by letter of march the municipality of dresden dismissed the applicant with effect from june the dismissal wa primarily based on the applicant statement during the staff meeting according to the letter of dismissal the applicant accusation against w had been unjustified by making these accusation in front of a large number of staff member and representative of the staff committee and of the trade union the applicant had damaged his superior reputation and thus irrevocably destroyed the mutual trust which wa necessary for effective cooperation it wa further observed that the applicant had not availed himself of the possibility of submitting his concern to his superior or to the mayor finally it wa noted that the applicant had been reprimanded for disloyal conduct on two previous occasion on july a local newspaper published a letter to the editor in which the applicant expressed the opinion that the deputy mayor w lacked any competence for resolving problem relating to housing issue by judgment of may the dresden labour court arbeitsgericht established that the employment contract had not been terminated by the dismissal since this could not be justified under section of the unfair dismissal act kündigungsschutzgesetz see relevant domestic law below the labour court did not find it necessary to decide whether the applicant allegation had been correct a they were in any event covered by the applicant right to freedom of expression on january the saxon labour court of appeal landesarbeitsgericht dismissed the appeal lodged by the municipality of dresden on november the federal labour court bundesarbeitsgericht upon the municipality appeal on point of law quashed the judgment of january and remitted the case to the labour court of appeal no azr under the caselaw of the federal labour court gross insult directed against the employer or the employer representative which constituted a serious violation of the concerned person honour could justify dismissal on ground relating to the employee conduct in order to establish the seriousness of the violation of honour it had to be established whether the applicant allegation were based on objective fact account also had to be taken of whether the criticism had been made among staff member or whether other person had been present finally it had to be considered that employee of the public service had to respect specific obligation under their code of conduct the federal labour court confirmed that the right to freedom of expression always had to be taken into account when assessing inappropriate language in a workplace context and that the applicant allegation fell within the scope of his right to freedom of expression accordingly the court had to weigh this right against the protected legal interest with which there had been an interference the federal labour court considered that the court of appeal when weighing the competing interest had failed to establish correctly the seriousness of the applicant allegation and of the violation of the deputy mayor personality right under the criminal code perversion of justice wa a crime subject to up to five year imprisonment in case of a criminal conviction under this provision a deputy mayor would automatically lose his office the conduct of a public service employee had to be measured against a stricter yardstick than that of an employee in the private sector in particular the employee wa under an obligation to behave in such a way a not to interfere with his public employer reputation under the professional code of conduct the employee had to exercise special restraint when openly criticising a superior decision a public allegation of perversion of justice directed against a superior in particular if it wa unfounded very seriously violated the superior personality right and interfered a a rule with the employee professional duty accordingly in order duly to weigh the competing interest in the light of the right to freedom of expression the court of appeal would have to examine whether the applicant allegation had been justified or not it had further to be taken into account that the allegation had been made during a staff meeting while it wa true that criticism made in this context could occasionally be exaggerated or polemic without giving the employer a ground for dismissal this right wa limited by the obligation not to disturb peace in the office it had to be taken into account in the applicant favour that the staff meeting concerned the suppression of the applicant field of work and that the atmosphere had been rather tense however this did not justify neglecting the fact that the allegation of perversion of justice did not concern the subject matter of the staff meeting but a single incident which dated back several year and had not been mentioned by the applicant since the applicant did not make use of the possibility of informing the mayor about his legal concern regarding the deputy mayor decision at the time of the staff meeting the decision dated back such a long time that an attempt to put the decision into question must have lacked the prospect of success accordingly it appeared that the applicant statement wa rather aimed at attacking the deputy mayor it had also to be taken into account that the statement wa made in the presence of person who were not necessarily bound by confidentiality accordingly there wa the risk that the applicant allegation would leak out of this close circle and be made known to a wider public the federal labour court finally observed that the applicant statement had to be seen in the wider context of his conduct and that the applicant had further exacerbated the conflict by the content of his written comment on november the saxon labour court of appeal quashed the judgment of the labour court dated may and dismissed the applicant action the labour court of appeal considered that the applicant dismissal had been justified because the applicant in his statement at the staff meeting and in his subsequent written submission had seriously insulted and slandered the deputy mayor by accusing him of perversion of justice based on a detailed examination of the factual and legal situation in the labour court of appeal considered that the decision taken by the deputy mayor at that time had been lawful the applicant written submission of december demonstrated that he wa not willing to accept and implement politically legitimate decision if they concerned sanction for misuse of property by house owner the content of the letter to the editor see paragraph above contained value judgment which did not amount to insult however the deputy mayor could not be expected to maintain daily cooperation with the applicant after reading this letter in which he had been described a incompetent the labour court of appeal further

35,in and life in kyiv he wa represented by m ll pankratova a lawyer practising in the same city the government were represented by their agent most recently mr i lishchyna the fact of the case a submitted by the party may be summarised a follows background to the casethe article of march the applicant is a journalist at the material time he wa working for the national weekly analytical newspaper dzerkalo tyzhnya which had a circulation of approximately copy on march in a series of publication written by the applicant an article entitled black triad nothing else matter in the case чорна трійка все інше справи не стосується wa published in the above newspaper on march it wa published on the newspaper website in the article the author referred to a previous publication of his and noted that in a certain case no which had been pending for some time before the court and had at least twice been remitted to the lower court a judgment had been taken on the basis of a forged copy of a document the original of which wa part of the material in the case file in a certain set of criminal proceeding the donetsk commercial court of appeal had nevertheless delivered it judgment on the basis of the forged copy the applicant went on describing what he called a system for obtaining a required result in order to get the result a particular law firm had been contacted the law firm had been paid a substantial fee by the plaintiff but had then surprisingly taken no further part in the proceeding in which the plaintiff a state enterprise had been represented by it own lawyer a for the court they had carefully referred the case up to the higher commercial court which in turn had taken an excessively long time over the proceeding before finally remitting the case to a lower court for the absence of a copy of the decision complained of in the meantime the plaintiff had been liquidated which according to the applicant had allowed numerous wrongdoing to be hidden the full text of the article read a follows in may last year dt dzerkalo tyzhnya no may published an article entitled how the court validated the copy of the document while the original document wa missing як суд легалізував копію при відсутності оригіналу it discussed an unprecedented legal incident in the history of ukrainian justice that occurred when based on a highly doubtful copy in term of the quality of the print and even more in term of the content of a certain document a guarantee letter the court delivered a judgment that ha been challenged by the respondent for four year now incidentally it wa challenged at the same time a the presidential decree on the formation of appellate court in ukraine wa issued for one simple reason according to the respondent they have never issued a document with such a registration number to the plaintiff and have not provided any guarantee nevertheless since there are many different method to make any conflict of interest palatable for themis the case ha become a kind of symbol of dignity and a fetish of the shortcoming of the very structural judicial system adopted from the developed democracy which wa based on a system tainted with sovietness совковостью and telephone law formation of the principle of independence of the third branch of power in our state paragraph dt ha repeatedly described the vicissitude of the litigation and mutual claim of the party in the dispute in the three year before the publication of the abovementioned article case no underwent two round of court proceeding from the court of first instance to the judgment of the supreme court of ukraine there wa also a third round under newly discovered circumstance in the scope of criminal proceeding instigated against the limited liability company n which stole from a state transport shipping enterprise intertrans something it wa not specified what worth more than million hryvnia uah and then vanished without a trace the prosecutor office discovered the original of the controversial guarantee letter it turned out that the guarantee letter referred to by the plaintiff intertrans had been provided by the defendant to a completely different enterprise which had initially been stated by the party at all the court hearing however for some reason that wa never taken into account the donetsk commercial court of appeal could have set the record straight but instead having established the existence of the guarantee letter in the criminal case file it delivered a decision based on a copy of that letter accordingly this author naturally asked the question i wonder what the commercial justice system will come up with this time in order to protect the state enterprisestructure that caused substantial pecuniary damage to the state paragraph reality ha surpassed the most daring expectation further immersion in the twilight of this dark and shady subject of how commercial dispute in the donetsk region are resolved give you the impression that a system exists that is quite primitive in term of the scheme and reliable in term of efficiency for obtaining the desired result in almost any case at the same time one get the impression that the essence of the problem doe not matter at all to it facilitator what is important is that the customer usually the plaintiff come to the right place at the right time paragraph a a rule this is a law firm to which large amount are legally transferred for legal service subsequently it is difficult to follow what active role the law firm take in the court proceeding instead the representative appear or a in the case of intertrans which for some unknown reason paid a fee of uah to the mysterious i are content with the participation of their own lawyer in the court proceeding throughout the entire process the case is considered by a host of servant of commercial justice in the donetsk region who pas it on with care and concern up to the higher commercial court of ukraine paragraph so when the original copy and then an additional document proving the forgery of the copy were discovered it became clear that it wa no longer necessary to discus the adversarial nature of the argument but the falsification and intent which is not the subject matter of commercial dispute but of criminal investigation and again just the fact the higher commercial court of ukraine hccu made it mark once again contrary to part of article of the commercial procedural code of ukraine which provides for a onemonth period for examining a request for review of a court decision due to newly discovered circumstance the hccu delayed examining the case for nine month paragraph first the hccu received all the necessary material from the donetsk court of appeal and appointed the day of the hearing but when the party arrived at kopylenka st in kyiv they discovered that nothing wa going to happen apparently the document wa missing accordingly the hccu immediately established a it can be seen from the content of the cassation appeal the defendant challenged the ruling of the donetsk commercial court of appeal of june however the case file doe not contain the contested ruling or any mention thereof therefore case no must be remitted to the donetsk regional commercial court for proper registration in accordance with the requirement of the law in force so a new date wa set and the donetsk regional commercial court wa assigned with a task although it clear that it wa meant for the donetsk commercial court of appeal but these are different state institution arent they or maybe it ha been a single structure for a long time a fact the judiciary of the largest commercial court of first instance in ukraine still doe not even suspect but which is clear to kyiv and thats why they wrote it paragraph in short so far no one ha bothered to answer where the ruling wa and where it suddenly came from in the material of case no they quietly sweep it under the carpet although most likely it wasnt an accident and they were achieving a specific task to delay consideration of the case until february indeed on that very day in accordance with order no of september of the ministry of transport in order to increase the efficiency of the use of state property the liquidation of intertrans wa completed and it wa removed from the united state register of enterprise and organisation of ukraine everything turned out a planned the court hearing took place after the specified date and the case file ha not yet been returned from kyiv to donetsk note this is only a part of the state problem inherited from the previous leadership of the ministry of transport informed source claim that the liquidation of intertrans made it possible to bury amount much larger than the unjustly recovered fund from ibank based on the copy however this is yet another topic worthy of journalistic attention paragraph the article ended with the following paragraph the eighth and ninth paragraph by the way ch the managing director of jointstock company d conducted an investigation and came to the conclusion that there wa an organised group operating in the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal in a letter to the head of the parliamentary subcommittee on combating organised crime and corruption in lawenforcement body and court he set out the name of the member of the group and the detailed mode of operation of the whole scheme a proof ch cited case no in which he had been a defendant against the state enterprise ugolnaya kompaniya krasnolimanskaya concerning the invalidation of a contract a well a a number of other similar dispute which were subsequently quashed by the supreme court of ukraine the judge well known from case no appear everywhere paragraph the reason for my address to the verkhovna rada said ch wa case no while the case wa going through all the judicial instance i felt the pressure of the system let say an interested client come knocking and asks for assistance with a case that will clearly lose they recommend that he go to law firm l then the contract is concluded with the client the money is transferred and the claim is prepared then in spite of any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge after that the case is always decided in the client favour if another party lodge an appeal a socalled black triad exists which embrace the principle that nothing else matter in the case most people who have been through these two judicial instance give up they lose their faith in justice and do not apply anywhere else they say to themselves they are all tarred with the same brush paragraph interim injunction proceeding on april judge a c d e b and f applied to the voroshylovsky district court of donetsk city hereinafter the district court for the application of preventive measure and securing of evidence заява про вжиття запобіжних заходів та про забезпечення доказів they argued that the article of march black triad nothing else matter in the case contained a negative evaluation of the activity of the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal and wa not based on any fact the style of the article wa extremely negative in particular the claimant indicated that the following statement did not correspond to reality an organised group the detailed mode of operation of the whole scheme the pressure of the system assistance with a case that will clearly lose in spite of any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge about existence of a black triad and the principle of nothing else matter in the case the applicant had not verified the information in question and had thus failed to comply with his professional duty according to the claimant the publication in question breached the honour dignity and professional reputation of the abovementioned court their management and the judge in particular it wa noted that judge e c d and f had examined case no which wa mentioned in the publication and therefore the article had caused them nonpecuniary damage similar damage had been caused to a the head of the donetsk commercial court of appeal who wa responsible for the organisational management of the court and b the deputy head of the donetsk regional commercial court who according to distribution of duty performed management of the structural unit that included the judge who had examined case no the claimant stated that they would lodge a defamation claim for damage against the newspaper the applicant and ch they eventually did so on april and august see paragraph below a the article in question contained element of an interview ie the last paragraph containing eventually the majority of the untrustful information referring inter alia to article and of the civil code of ukraine the ccu see paragraph below they argued that their right were being infringed while the article wa still available online and requested it removal under article of the code of civil procedure the ccp see paragraph below the claimant request wa for an order against the editorial board of the newspaper to remove the article from the newspaper website in addition they also asked for the attachment of the newspaper property the property of the applicant and that of ch in order to secure their claim finally they asked that the newspaper provide the document their editorial board and the applicant had used to verify the information published in the article on april the district court ordered the editorial board of dzerkalo tyzhnya to remove the article from the newspaper website in it oneandahalfpage decision the court merely reiterated the content of the claimant request the court then referred to article of the ccp which set out the possible injunction measure for securing a claim and noted that the request should be granted in part providing no reasoning or assessment of the claimant position the applicant the newspaper and ch appealed against this decision noting inter alia that an interim injunction such a taking an article down from a website wa not prescribed under domestic law and furthermore that the court had referred to article of the ccp which provided for interim measure after lodging a claim and not before they further noted that the court had failed to provide any reasoning in particular they argued that the article had not named a single judge and that therefore the claimant had failed to prove that their right had been breached on august the donetsk regional court of appeal upheld the district court decision having reiterated the claimant request and quoted article of the ccu the court noted the following the challenged article carry information which is disseminated on the internet since such information is accessible to the general public and is difficult to control the removal of the article from the website similar to a property attachment under paragraph of article of the ccp is the only measure that would ensure protection of the individual right pending examination of the case on the merit the firstinstance court relied on article of the ccp which provides for securing a claim by prohibiting certain action such reference is erroneous since no claim had been lodged at the time when the ruling wa delivered however this shortcoming can not serve a a ground for quashing the court ruling a the request had been examined on the merit correctly the applicant appealed in cassation arguing that article of the ccp did not prescribe any interim measure such a removing an article from a website he further stated that the court had failed to provide any reasoning for it decision and that the claimant had not provided any evidence to support their argument that their right had been infringed some two and a half year later on january the kyiv court of appeal sitting a a cassation court rejected the applicant appeal against the decision of april and august for lack of evidence of breach of the law the above judicial decision were enforced and the impugned article wa removed from the newspaper website on an unspecified date but no later than august subsequent publication on march a the head of the donetsk commercial court of appeal and b a former deputy head of the donetsk regional commercial court sent a letter to the chief editor of dzerkalo tyzhnya demanding a retraction of the information published in the article of march they provided a text to be published for that purpose the letter wa received at the office of the newspaper on march on april following the interim injunction issued by the voroshyloskyy district court of donetsk see paragraph above dzerkalo tyzhnya published an article entitled black triad to be continued чорна трійка далі буде indicating a and b a the author of the letter requesting the retraction the article which apparently wa a summary of the text of their letter of march read a follows every court case is a complicated tangle of antagonistic interest of the party and it settlement irrespective of the outcome will always leave one of the party unsatisfied even when a party understands the lack of ground for it appeal against the court decision very often only the requirement of paying the court and legal fee would stop it from lodging such an appeal most people naturally consider all decision in their favour a lawful and fair and vice versa everyone who ha acted a a judge in any dispute know the loser will most probably regard the decision a unfair and biased on march dt dzerkalo tyzhnya published an article by anatoliy yeremenko entitled black triad nothing else matter in the case the article raised very important and relevant problem for modern ukrainian society it cite the story of the managing director of jointstock company d ch who allegedly discovered unlawful activity on the part of judge of the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal however many were surprised by chs hard feeling towards the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal indeed given the number of case won by jointstock company d and the strength of those case it should have been more likely for his opponent in those case to have had reason to feel that way take for example the decision in case no according to which the claimant jointstock company d wa awarded uah however another case no is cited a an example in the article for some unknown reason the request of d managing director under article to of the code of commercial procedure of ukraine to have his case examined by a bench of judge being disregarded wa not mentioned in the newspaper article we shall explain for those who are not lawyer that these article provide for the examination of case by a bench of judge in a local commercial court where their category and complexity so requires however ch based his request exclusively on the necessity to avoid any pressure on the court by the opposite party which is not a ground for allowing the examination of the case by a bench of judge therefore if we follow the letter of the law the court should have rejected chs request a unlawful however having taken into consideration the category of the case and the extensive number of circumstance to be examined the court allowed his request it follows that the claimant is either unable to understand the text of the law but take the liberty to criticise court decision or he consciously provoked the court to reject the request in order to have an excuse to complain later about the court bias but despite the positive decision about the composition of the court in case no ch asserts that then in spite of any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge it is easy to remark that such a conclusion contradicts the fact a well a the conclusion that the case is always decided in the client favour and that there is a socalled black triad in the court of appeal even more offensive is his final conclusion that they are all tarred with the same brush the only lawful way to receive a decision in your favour is to act within the law and to provide sufficient argument and valid evidence but some it is unlikely that they could be called lawabiding citizen stop at nothing if the end justifies the mean why not try all of them the easiest from a practical point of view but we emphasise not effective and the least ethical way to convince the court to adopt the required decision is to issue a warning in a manner akin to it is better not to mess with me by manipulating public opinion such people try to influence the decision of public servant including judge indeed hardly anybody would wish to be associated with the black triad currently the donetsk regional commercial court is examining the case in which d is one of the party so is the tragical farce of ch not an attempt to scare the court and to influence it future judgment suggesting that the black triad article could be continued with the family name of all the judge with firm belief and they could later try to prove their integrity publicly it is well known the higher a person social status the more society is inclined towards believing in the most absurd gossip about them so they have to prove their innocence therefore the negative evaluation of the functioning of the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal wa given in the absence of any merit in particular there is no reason to believe that there is an organised group involved in unlawful activity operating in the abovementioned court there is no practice of assisting interested client in obtaining positive decision in case that will clearly lose in the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal furthermore the employee of these court never recommend particular law firm it is also untrue that despite any existing procedure the case are given to the right judge in order to deliver a decision in the case in favour of the client the court doe not and can not have client and decision in the case mentioned in the article were taken after impartial examination of all the circumstance of the case and the evidence submitted by the party there are no ground to conclude that most people who went through the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk commercial court of appeal gave up and lost their faith in justice and that they do not apply anywhere else on may the claimant sent another letter to the chief editor of dzerkalo tyzhnya demanding that the newspaper print a retraction stressing that their previous request had not been addressed adequately since the publication had been printed without a mention in the title of the word retraction and that it had contained only summarised element of their letter of march on may the chief editor of dzerkalo tyzhnya replied that the above demand wa groundless before the examination of the respective claim by the court and the pronouncement of the respective judgment defamation proceeding on april and august the same claimant see paragraph above lodged defamation claim against the applicant ch and the editorial board of dzerkalo tyzhnya they claimed that their professional reputation honour and dignity had been damaged by the article in question according to them the statement contained in the article had undermined the authority of the judiciary in their updated claim the judge asked the court to recognise the following statement a defamatory there wa an organised group operating in the donetsk regional commercial court and in the donetsk commercial court of appeal that ch had discovered a detailed mode of operation of the whole scheme the pressure of the system an interested client come knocking and asks for assistance with a case that will clearly lose they recommend that he go to law firm l then the contract is concluded with the client the money is transferred and the claim is prepared then despite any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge after that the case is always decided in the client favour if another party lodge an appeal a socalled black triad exists which embrace the principle that nothing else matter in the case and they are all tarred with the same brush they further asked the court to order the editorial board of dzerkalo tyzhnya to publish a retraction of the above statement and to order the applicant and ch to pay ukrainian hryvnia uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage to each claimant they noted that the newspaper had partly restored their right by allowing them to exercise their right to reply to the allegation in the impugned article and by removing the article from their website in his response to the claim the applicant insisted that the statement concerned contained information important to the general public and the source of the information were ch and chs letter to the parliamentary subcommittee he further noted that he had duly verified that the letter had indeed been submitted to parliament and that it wa a ground for a related inquiry by the lawenforcement service at the same time he stated that chs remark were in line with the result of his own journalistic investigation in respect of case no and which were based on the case file of those case the applicant considered that since he had received the information from an official of an organisation he wa relieved from liability for published material by virtue of section of the press act lastly the applicant noted that the claimant name had never been mentioned in the article and that there were at least twelve other judge who had examined the case in issue in the donetsk regional commercial court but who had not lodged a defamation claim he also referred to his previous article of may in which a and c had been named but against which they had never initiated defamation proceeding in support of his argument the applicant attached inter alia chs letter to the parliamentary subcommittee the case file of several case he had examined in the context of his investigation including case no and his previous article on the topic in question on an unspecified date the applicant and ch also lodged counterclaim the applicant stated that before initiating defamation proceeding and requesting the interim injunction a c d e b and f had illegally obtained his personal information including his name and contact detail he asked the court to find such action unlawful ch asked the court to determine that the information contained in the judge letter to the newspaper published on april see paragraph above wa untrue on october the petrovskyy local court examined the case on the merit having analysed the eighth and ninth paragraph of the article in question the court allowed the judge claim in part the court concluded that the statement contained in those paragraph were defamatory had presented a distorted view of reality and were not based on actual fact and their publication had resulted in nonpecuniary damage being inflicted on all the claimant the relevant part of the court judgment read a follows the information contained in the relevant paragraph of the article did not correspond to reality and tarnished the honour dignity and reputation of the claimant in view of the following at the court hearing the applicant confirmed that in the eighth and ninth paragraph of the article he had used information provided by ch including the letter to the parliamentary subcommittee along with chs succinct commentary which disclosed element of an interview the respondent ch confirmed that the author had used the information provided by him in the eighth and ninth paragraph of the impugned article upon analysis of the ninth paragraph of the article it is established that it wa published in the form of an interview pursuant to section of the copyright and related right act the copyright of a recorded interview is to be regarded a coauthorship the interviewee and the interviewer are coauthor of the interview the court considers that the applicant and ch are coauthor of the article in the letter addressed to the head of the parliamentary subcommission on combating organised crime and corruption ch stated that an organised criminal group wa operating in the donetsk regional commercial court and the donetsk regional court of appeal which on demand provided judgment and ruling required by client he named the member of the group and described how it operated ch also sent this letter to the state security service and wa informed that his allegation were being verified in response to an enquiry of the donetsk commercial court of appeal on april the administration of the security service of ukraine in the donetsk region reported that upon examination перевірки of chs allegation no proof of the existence and activity of such an organised criminal group in the abovementioned court had been found therefore the relevant statement published in the eighth paragraph of the article had not been proved and accordingly they were untrue the article referred to chs letter to in which he directly mentioned a criminal organisation that existed in the abovementioned court even though the article did not reproduce the content of that letter the statement in the eighth and ninth paragraph suggested to the reader that the existence of a criminal group wa being discussed in their description of the procedure for distributing and examining case the coauthor of the article accused the judge of the above court not only of violating bylaw but also of what could be interpreted a abuse of office and a miscarriage of justice both being criminal offence the expression organised group wa used in the article in the criminal sense and wa associated with a criminal offence committed by an organised group pursuant to article of the constitution of ukraine a person is presumed innocent of committing a crime until their guilt is proved in accordance with the law and established by a verdict of a court no such verdict ha been delivered in respect of the claimant by any domestic court and therefore those statement were defamatory at the same time the court can not take into consideration the defendant argument according to which at the court hearing they had provided evidence in support of their statement a to the existence of a special procedure for examining case in view of the following a noted above the statement a to the existence of a special procedure for examining case in the abovementioned court constitute an accusation that a crime ha been committed which must be proved by certain mean in view of article of the constitution a to the presumption of innocence the above statement can be proved only by a verdict of a court which doe not exist in respect of the claimant section of the press act provides that a journalist is exempted from liability for the publication of material that is untrue defames the honour and dignity of citizen and organisation infringes the right and lawful interest of citizen or constitutes abuse of the freedom of the printed mass medium and the right of journalist if the information is contained in a reply to a request for access to official document and to a request for written or oral information provided in accordance with the information act section of the information act provides that a request for access to official document is a request addressed to relevant state authority or it official in order to examine the official document since jointstock company d wa not a state body and it managing director ch wa not an official of a state authority his letter could not be considered an official document within the meaning of section of the press act and section of the information act under section of the information act value judgment are not subject to retraction or proof of veracity the information in the eighth and ninth paragraph of the article particularly the following statement can be interpreted a containing factual information and thus they are not value judgment ch came to the conclusion that there wa an organised group operating in the donetsk regional commercial court and in the donetsk commercial court of appeal an interested client come knocking and asks for assistance with a case that will clearly lose they recommend that he go to the law firm l then the contract is concluded with the client the money is transferred and the statement of claim is prepared then in spite of any existing procedure the case is distributed to the right judge after that the case is always decided in the client favour if another party lodge an appeal a socalled black triad exists which embrace the principle that nothing else matter in the case by virtue of article of the ccu one of the element of the offence is dissemination of information about a person which would enable an observer to deduce that it concern a specific identifiable individual or at least that the person belongs to a group of people to whom such information pertains indication of the person name is not obligatory for information to be considered a concerning a specific person if he or she is identifiable on the basis of other element the claimant a c d and e are judge at the donetsk commercial court of appeal and b and f at the donetsk regional commercial court in addition a is a head of the donetsk commercial court of appeal and b used to be a deputy head of the donetsk regional commercial court in the article the author assert the existence of an organised group in the abovementioned court which ha been found by this court to be inaccuratefalse this fact alone tarnish the dignity honour and reputation of the managing official of such court namely a and ba proof of the existence of an organised group in the abovementioned court the author refer to case no having examined the case file of the above case the court established that b assigned f to examine case no f wa a presiding judge at the firstinstance court examination of this case and e c and d further examined this case in the court of appeal thus a a result of the publication of untrue information all of the above judge sustained nonpecuniary damage including b who at the material time wa deputy head of the donetsk regional commercial court and wa managing the court division comprising the judge who had examined the case at first instance a the head of donetsk commercial court of appeal who is responsible for the organisational management of the court where the case in issue wa examined on appeal also sustained nonpecuniary damage the court dismisses the respondent argument concerning the fact that the name of the claimant had not been mentioned since the coauthor of the article provided sufficient information to identify them in addition the information on judge examining the domestic case wa not restricted the copy of the court decision had been sent to the party and information about these judge could be known to an unlimitedunrestricted number of person when setting a compensation to be paid to the claimant by the applicant and ch the court noted that the applicant wa guilty to a lesser degree since it wa ch who had provided him with the information however the applicant had failed to verify the information and had thus failed in his professional duty a set out in section of the press act the court ordered the editorial board of dzerkalo tyzhnya to publish a retraction of the statement contained in the eighth and ninth paragraph of the article and the applicant to pay uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage to each of the claimant plus their legal uah per claimant and court fee uah per claimant in total the applicant wa ordered to pay the equivalent of euro eur in respect of nonpecuniary damage and eur in respect of legal and court fee ch wa ordered to pay uah in respect of nonpecuniary damage per claimant plus legal and court fee finally the court dismissed the applicant and chs counterclaim a unsubstantiated the applicant appealed against the judgment of october of the petrovskyy local court relying on the following argument i the court had failed to substantiate the existence of the nonpecuniary damage by not giving concrete reason for the effect the article had had on the claimant and their psychological health ii the court had failed to make a distinction between the fact and value judgment in this respect the applicant noted that the phrase tarred with the same brush wa clearly a value judgment yet it had not been examined by the court separately and had been found defamatory a a part of the whole text iii the material in the case file of case no and a number of other case were sufficient to conclude that the statement published in the article were true iv the court had failed to examine the existence of men rea in the applicant action v the court had gone beyond what had been claimed in the complaint and had found defamatory the wider content of the statement published in the article he referred to the fact that the court had relied on the full text of the eighth and ninth paragraph instead of only the particular statement quoted by the claimant in their complaint for example the phrase ch concluded and most of the people and vi the amount of the court fee he had been ordered to pay to the claimant wa excessive on january the donetsk regional court of appeal upheld the firstinstance court judgment on the merit and modified it concerning legal and court fee reducing the court fee imposed on the applicant to the equivalent of eur the relevant part of the appellate court judgment read a follows it follows from the content of the impugned article that the respondent ch had conducted his own investigation and concluded that there wa an organised group in the donetsk regional commercial court and donetsk regional court of appeal with reference to the letter of the head of the subcommittee of verkhovna rada naming the member of the group and the detailed mode of operation of the whole scheme there are reference to case no and the ninth paragraph contains a direct speech and it discus on behalf of ch case no at the court hearing the respondent maintained that the information published a to the existence of an organised group in the court in question wa true they insisted that case no a well a other case had been allocated by b and a to their judge in violation of the order on specialisation of the court composition they submitted the order allocating the case noting the breach allegedly committed during the allocation of case no and others the court reasonably rejected the respondent argument the allocation of case in the court in question is an internal matter for the court and such circumstance can not point to the existence of an organised group or functioning of a scheme with interested client at the time the article wa published the claimant had not been convicted or found liable of act of corruption it follows from the certificate in the case file that all the claimant serve a judge at the court in question in the article the claimant were accused of violating the law during the examination of commercial case however such circumstance were not proved at the court hearing in

therefore not base it claim on article of the civil code however the court of appeal classified the applicant action a competitive in nature statement of fact made in violation of the unfair competition act could not be justified by the right to freedom of expression the court of appeal found that austrian law provided wideranging protection for commercial and economic interest those who published an opinion in an economically competitive context were obliged to exercise a higher level of diligence with regard to the fact and base of their allegation than those who acted in the noncompetitive context of a public debate of general interest therefore the court of appeal upheld the injunction decision with regard to the statement about the locust company however a regard the further statement namely that provision of certain service by the f company wa a disastrous development the court of appeal found that read in context the statement indicated a general assessment and did not refer to a particular service of the f company it wa therefore to be considered a personal opinion and thus a value judgment that wa not defamatory under article of the civil code it also did not fall under section of the unfair competition act the applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal with the supreme court oberster gerichtshof on january the supreme court dismissed the extraordinary appeal it acknowledged the applicant argument that where a competitor even for economic purpose took part in a debate of public interest freedom of expression had to hold more weight in the balancing test however the supreme court observed that the applicant had made their statement in the clearly economic context of competition between medical practitioner and company which provided the same service the applicant could have warned their member of the possible risk of cooperating with company without overstepping the margin of acceptable criticism however the applicant had exceeded that limit and stated that the f company wa a locust that statement wa one of fact and the applicant had not provided evidence of a factual basis for their allegation and had therefore exceeded the permissible limitation of freedom of expression b substantive proceeding on july the commercial court gave it judgment in the substantive proceeding and ordered the applicant to refrain from repeating the statement that the f company wa ruthless towards third party in particular medical practitioner and patient and stating that the f company wa a locust company a locust fund or a locust it further ordered the applicant to publish and display the operative part of the judgment on the first applicant organisation website for thirty day and to publish it in the first applicant organisation print newsletter the commercial court made substantial reference to the court of appeal reasoning in the interim injunction proceeding it followed the previous finding that the relevant statement did not constitute defamation pursuant to article of the civil code examining the statement in relation to the provision of the unfair competition act the commercial court found that the letter had been written by the chamber of medical doctor in a commercial and not a political context it had also had the advancement of independent medical practice a an objective and had contained a warning regarding capital venture which allegedly threatened doctor independence the commercial court found the relevant comparison with locust to be statement of fact regarding both the f company and it conduct in relation to third party doctor and patient the statement were also likely to damage the f company commercial interest and had not been proved to be true the used language could also not be justified with a reference to the right to freedom of expression a the statement wa uttered within the framework of a commercial competitive relationship with reference to the court caselaw allowing for a wider margin of appreciation under article of the convention with regard to commercial language the commercial court observed that a competitor wa required to be more diligent in the context of commercial communication among competitor the term locust wa almost exclusively loaded with negative meaning which led to the unethical general vilification of a competitor the applicant were therefore prohibited from using that statement in relation to the f company pursuant to the unfair competition act on september the applicant lodged an appeal against that judgment on december the vienna court of appeal dismissed the appeal a unfounded it referred to the extensive reasoning given in the interim injunction proceeding and added that according to the caselaw of the supreme court the test used to verify whether a statement wa covered by the right to freedom of expression required the assessment of whether a factual basis for such a statement existed if a competitor participated in a public debate of general interest freedom of expression had more weight with regard to the assessment of the statement than in the context of purely commercial communication the greater the public interest in being properly informed and the le the statement related to commercial interest the more the statement would be protected by article of the convention in the present case there wa no doubt that there wa an ongoing public debate however the commercial interest of the applicant had very much been in the foreground of the communicated statement itself the applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal on point of law against that judgment which wa rejected by the supreme court on july the supreme court found that the applicant had not only called the f company a locust but had also reproached this company for negative conduct such a dominating doctor dismissing doctor who did not act in accordance with company wish and focusing on economic factor rather than the welfare of patient herrschaft über den ärztlichen berufstand kündigung nicht spurender ärzte orientierung an ökonomischen erwägungen und damit nicht am wohl der patienten therefore the expression used had turned into a statement of fact giving the reader the impression that the f company had already demonstrated unethical conduct which threatened the interest of doctor and patient in view of the specific circumstance of the case the prohibition ruled upon by the lower court wa justified even though the applicant had taken part in a debate of general public interest an untrue and damaging statement of fact wa not protected by freedom of expression furthermore the issuing of warning concerning the potential risk of the provision of medical service by company wa not a such prohibited by the decision of the austrian court the applicant had only been required to refrain from making untrue statement of fact in respect of their competitor the decision of the supreme court wa served on

41,background to the case the applicant wa born in and life in weinheim he is a campaigner against abortion and operates an antiabortion website in december there wa an ongoing public debate on development in human embryonic stemcell research a part of the debate the catholic bishop f voiced criticism of human embryonic stemcell research and a group of scientist at the university of bonn responded to that criticism on december bishop f issued a press release repudiating allegation that his earlier comment had implied a degree of similarity between the scientist carrying out embryonic stemcell research and the nazi who had performed experiment on human he emphasised that he had had absolutely no intention of casting such defamatory aspersion upon the scientist but reasserted his belief that there wa an urgent need for such vitally important ethical issue to be debated critically he claimed that he had never wished to imply that there had been any link between stemcell research and the ideological and historical context of the crime committed by the dehumanising nazi system which should not be relativised through comparison on december the applicant issued a press release for his initiative never again nie wieder e v with the title dog which have been hit bark stemcell research in germany getroffene hunde bellen stammzellenforschung in deutschland the press release wa published on the internet and handed out a leaflet it read the initiative never again nie wieder e v and the austrian christian social working group christlich soziale arbeitsgemeinschaft österreichs wish to make known their opposition to the press release issued by the university of bonn on december which bear the signature of eighteen wellknown professor and in which the professor express their outrage at the comment made by bishop f name abbreviated by the court comparing modernday stemcell research to the experiment on human being carried out by the nazi the professor appear to have forgotten that these experiment were performed in nazi time by willing doctor and scientist these doctor and scientist who were clearly in bondage to the rogue state and subservient to it also carried out their research solely for the good of the people the research performed during the nazi regime took place at a later stage of human life the presentday research take place at an earlier stage of human life do the professor want to determine human right to life on the basis of how useful they are the principle of human dignity doe not apply only after a particular phase of growth ha been completed and people should not be allowed to experiment at will during this phase the professor can spin it any way they want aggravated murder mord will always be aggravated murder regardless of the stage of life at which the human being is destroyed the fact that others were responsible for performing these contract killing doe not provide moral justification for working with this human material the comment made by bishop f name abbreviated by the court which were presumably addressed directly to prof dr b name abbreviated by the court were absolutely accurate prof dr b us embryo people for research purpose at the university of bonn that were murdered in israel and then sold to germany for significant sum of money during nazi time german scientist performed research experiment on jew and then murdered them nowadays the unborn child of people who follow the religion of moses the jew are murdered and sold to the christian country of germany for research purpose all with the blessing of both israel and germany the comparison drawn by bishop f wa entirely justified the crime against democracy being committed in the here and now must be denounced in the strongest possible term and brought to people attention the time ha finally arrived to overcome the spirit of auschwitz b criminal proceeding on november the weinheim district court convicted the applicant of insult and sentenced him to a penalty of thirty daily fine of euro eur each in it judgment the court acknowledged the applicant right to freedom of expression and to impart to others his belief that the fusion of an egg and a sperm represented the beginning of human life and that research using imported stem cell from terminated embryo involved the destruction of human life it also emphasised that the applicant had the fundamental liberty to exercise his freedom of expression by imparting his opinion strikingly and pointedly including in the form of abusive criticism addressed at wellknown researcher referred to by name however the court found that when viewed in it entirety the press release had exceeded the permissible bound of abusive criticism the court based this decision on the fact that the implication that the scientist had been guilty not just of committing murder but of doing so for deeply despicable motif had been a central theme running through the press release and had escalated in the phrase the time ha finally arrived to overcome the spirit of auschwitz it concluded that the applicant had intended to imply that the scientist carrying out stemcell research had been prompted by the same criminal sadistic and dehumanising motif a those responsible for performing unimaginably cruel mass experiment on human such a mengele in auschwitz given prof dr b position a a doctor and scientist this implication had been severely insulting on march the mannheim regional court rejected the applicant appeal similarly to the district court the regional court acknowledged the applicant right to freedom of expression and that his press release had contributed to a debate of great public interest it further held that the majority of the statement in the press release had been value judgment and that therefore the press release had to be classified a a value judgment and not a a statement of fact nonetheless the court stated that freedom of expression wa not granted unconditionally and could be subject to restriction with a view to protecting inter alia the right to personal honour when examining contribution to a debate of public interest however there had to be a presumption in favour of freedom of speech the regional court further found that the criterion for abusive criticism had not been met criticism which wa excessive or even aggressive in nature wa not necessarily abusive the relevant criterion wa whether the main purpose of the criticism had been to defame an individual rather than to debate the relevant issue the court concluded that this wa not applicable in the case at hand since the applicant past behaviour and the content of the press release showed that the focus had been on the issue rather than the individual doctor against whom allegation had been made the court therefore found that the right to freedom of expression had to be balanced with the legally protected personality right of prof dr b and emphasised that freedom of expression granted equal protection to all statement of opinion regardless of whether they were useful useless correct incorrect emotional rational or even polemical or insulting the regional court took into account that the press release had represented the applicant contribution to the formation of public opinion but believed that referring to prof dr b by name had been equivalent to linking his professional conduct to the atrocity committed by the nazi it concluded that this had represented a serious infringement of his personality right which had also been unnecessary since the applicant could have contributed to the debate without referring to the professor by name on february the court of appeal rejected an appeal on point of law by the applicant a unfounded and on july the federal constitutional court refused to admit a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant without providing reason bv r ii relevant domestic law the relevant provision of the german basic

43,in and life in kassel he wa represented by mr b hopmann a lawyer practising in berlin the government were represented by m g marok wachter director of the office of justice of the principality of liechtenstein the fact of the case a submitted by the party may be summarised a follows the event leading to the applicant dismissal the applicant is a doctor specialised in general and internal medicine from june he wa employed a deputy chief physician of the department for internal medicine at the liechtenstein national hospital liechtensteinisches landesspital a registered liechtenstein public law foundation he worked under a contract of indefinite duration which could be terminated with six month notice his direct superior wa dr h chief physician of the said department on september the applicant did some research in the electronic medical file of the hospital he found information showing that four patient had died in the hospital following the administration of morphine he concluded from note made in these file that dr h who had treated these patient had practised active euthanasia on the same day the applicant met with the president of the control committee of the liechtenstein parliament the parliamentary control committee mr m on the latter initiative following several anonymous complaint about deficiency in quality in the liechtenstein national hospital on that occasion the applicant voiced suspicion that dr h had practised active euthanasia on september the applicant on mr m advice lodged a criminal complaint against dr h with the public prosecutor office which instituted proceeding against dr h on suspicion inter alia of killing on request and participation in another person suicide on september the police seized the paper medical file of the four patient concerned at the liechtenstein national hospital and questioned dr h on september the applicant following further research in the hospital electronic medical file informed the public prosecutor office that he suspected that dr h had practised active euthanasia on six additional patient he wa questioned by the police on the same day he supported his suspicion by the fact that according to the electronic file the death of these patient had occurred shortly after the start of the treatment with morphine that morphine had been given even without an indication that the patient suffered from pain that the treatment had been called supportive therapy or supportive measure and having regard to the medication administered he stressed that the aim of his statement wa to avert damage to patient of the hospital at the time of the event the liechtenstein national hospital had a body to which irregularity could be reported anonymously via an online form the critical incident reporting system cirs while initially dr h alone had been the person examining and acting upon such report this task had been entrusted to a group of three person not including dr h since summer at the latest it is unclear when this change in responsibility wa communicated within the hospital the applicant did not contact this body on and september the vicepresident of the hospital foundation board drew up three report on the request of the foundation board regarding the treatment of the ten patient in question having examined the patient paper file and having questioned dr h he concluded that all patient had been in a palliative situation under the who standard and that there had not been any mistake regarding the morphine administered he considered that the applicant had failed to take into account the pain or difficulty in breathing of the patient concerned which had made necessary the treatment in question if the applicant had read the patient paper file which alone a had been known at the time had contained complete information regarding the patient condition and treatment and to which he had had access he would have realised immediately that his suspicion of active euthanasia were clearly unfounded on september the applicant wa suspended from office on october the applicant made a written statement setting out his position to the national hospital on the latter request he explained that he had done some research in the electronic file of several patient who had died in the past week following an indication by a doctor working in the hospital that recently there had been an unusual rise in death of patient in the hospital in his view the ten patient concerned had clearly not been treated lege artis after thorough reflection he had decided to inform the public prosecutor office in order to protect the patient and the hospital and to comply with his own ethical conviction and the provision of the physician act ärztegesetz see paragraph below a he wa convinced that there had been criminal offence a he had not expected the matter to be investigated properly within the hospital and in view of the urgency of the situation he had not contacted an internal body of the hospital prior to lodging a criminal complaint with the public prosecutor office in a report received by the national hospital on october a swiss external medical expert in palliative medicine commissioned by the hospital n having studied the medical paper file of the patient concerned and having heard dr h concluded that no active euthanasia had been practised on the ten patient in question the expert considered that the patient palliative treatment had been necessary and justified a they had been at the end of their life they had died a a result of their illness and not a a result of their treatment they had been given morphine in order to treat their pain and difficulty in breathing and not to end their life the expert noted that some of the morphine dos prescribed especially those without upper limit may not have been necessary but such dos had never been administered in practice on october the director of the national hospital dismissed the applicant without notice he considered that owing to the applicant severe fault the relationship of trust with him had been destroyed irretrievably he argued that the applicant had failed to raise his allegation of active euthanasia and quality flaw with the hospital competent internal body prior to raising them externally with the president of the parliamentary control committee and with the public prosecutor office the applicant had been obliged to inform dr h or at least the director of the hospital or a member of the foundation board with whom he had a normal relationship of his allegation furthermore the applicant allegation of euthanasia had been considered a clearly unfounded by the external expert commissioned by the hospital the liechtenstein newspaper and radio repeatedly reported on the suspicion of active euthanasia at the liechtenstein national hospital and the criminal investigation against dr h in this respect the outcome of the criminal investigation proceeding against dr h and against the applicant the investigating judge in the criminal proceeding against dr h had also commissioned an external expert practising in austria l in his report dated october received by the investigating judge on december the expert having regard to the medical paper file of the patient in question came to the conclusion that dr h had not practised active euthanasia the patient had been given morphine only a necessitated by their palliative situation and this treatment had not caused the patient death doubt regarding such palliative medical treatment and ethical decision taken in that context could be excluded by a better documentation of the treatment in the future on december the criminal proceeding against dr h were discontinued on december criminal proceeding instituted against the applicant for having deliberately cast wrong suspicion of a criminal offence on another person by his allegation that dr h had practised active euthanasia were equally discontinued the proceeding before the domestic court proceeding before the regional court on november the applicant brought an action against the liechtenstein national hospital for payment of some swiss franc chf in compensation for the loss of salary and further pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage he claimed that his dismissal without notice had been unlawful there had been no important reason for his dismissal a lodging a criminal complaint against dr h had been justified in view of the concrete suspicion of active euthanasia and the gravity of the offence concerned on august the regional court dismissed the applicant action it found that the applicant dismissal without notice had been justified under article a and of the civil code see paragraph below the court considered in essence that there had been an important reason for the employing hospital to terminate the employment contract a the applicant had failed to sufficiently verify his unfounded suspicion of active euthanasia in the patient medical paper file and to signal his suspicion within the hospital prior to informing external body thereof the continuation of the employment relationship by the hospital could no longer be expected in good faith proceeding before the court of appeal on january the court of appeal allowing an appeal lodged by the applicant quashed the regional court judgment it ordered the defendant hospital to pay the applicant chf in salary arrears and remitted the remainder of the case to the regional court for a fresh consideration of the applicant compensation claim the court of appeal found that the applicant dismissal without notice had not been justified the disclosure of irregularity to third person wa covered by the right to freedom of expression and could justify a dismissal only if it wa coupled with a serious breach of the duty of loyalty however there wa no such serious breach in the present case the court of appeal argued that the institution of proceeding against dr h by the public prosecutor office confirmed that the applicant suspicion had not been unfounded in view of the severity of the offence at issue contacting external body such a the parliamentary control committee or the public prosecutor office which were both under a duty of confidentiality had not been disproportionate the fact that the applicant had reported directly to the public prosecutor office did not raise an issue in this respect the court further agreed with the applicant that in the circumstance of the case reporting the issue to dr h in the context of the internal mechanism to report irregularity had not been a suitable approach proceeding before the supreme court on may the supreme court allowing the defendant hospital appeal on point of law quashed the court of appeal judgment it dismissed the applicant claim for payment of chf in salary arrears in a partial judgment and remitted the remainder of the case to the court of appeal in a partial decision for it to dismiss the applicant action in that regard the supreme court considered that the applicant dismissal without notice had been lawful it stressed that the applicant a senior employee had only consulted the electronic medical file which he had known to be incomplete although he could have consulted the paper file at any moment if he had done so he would have recognised immediately that his suspicion were clearly unfounded he had thus failed to verify his serious and unjustified allegation before disclosing them to third person and before lodging a criminal complaint this

underlined and numbered for reference the part of the article rephrased and summarised by the court are presented in square bracket where initial are used the actual article contained is full name his first name surname andor patronymic in various combination in january the plenary verkhovna rada of ukraine hereinafter the parliament wa to examine the question of is appointment to the position of judge on a permanent basis until retirement age the matter wa to be examined because is previous tenyear appointment wa expiring see the relevant constitutional and legislative rule concerning the

question of is permanent appointment owing to concern raised by some member of parliament about is candidature see the summary of the transcript of the debate at paragraph below parliament decided to adjourn the examination of the question an article published in the issue of the newspaper dated january wa dedicated to the above event and entitled purgatory for judge чистилище для судей it spread over two full page the first page of the article contained the following text we often criticise member of parliament and for good reason but this gathering of people with different view and business interest under the same roof sometimes produce unpredictable decision perhaps it is too soon to call this democracy however the fact that the mp have rejected the advance of the president of the kherson court of appeal mr i получил от народных депутатов гарбуза a speaks volume so let u talk about justice in the kherson region and first of all about it president mr i below we publish a transcript of the proceeding of parliament concerning appointment of judge for life on january many kherson resident watched live this sitting of parliament and our mr i wa the main hero of that show a we have been writing about him much lately other publication have been writing even more we will provide our reader with a brief reminder about mr i based only on our own publication which by the way have not been challenged we are also in possession of a number of incontrovertible document we give you this in lieu of a prologue in his eight year and counting at the head of the regional court i ha found himself dozen of loyal people lawyer judge and important businessmen for whose personal and business interest he ha successfully lobbied through favourable judicial decision a обзавелся десятками преданных людей чей бизнес и личные интересы успешно лоббировал с помощью нужных решений в судахhere is the conclusion i is considered the person in charge and untouchable a in the kherson region where governor succeeded each other in year if one remove him successfully even if peacefully the people will believe in change for the better in the pervasively corrupt judicial system this document arrived in our office last autumn it wa addressed to a very highranking and influential official in the capital in response to his request for information from kherson but the first official document had appeared right after i took up his position and they corroborate the abovementioned reasoning here is just a short quote from the letter by member of the regional council to the president of the supreme court dated using his position i received u dollar from g who ha been released from serving his sentence and confiscation of his asset he thus helped g avoid his liability visàvis his creditor they go on to describe is trick проделки on two page a and here is the response of the supreme court president to the abovequoted episode there followed a quote from a letter of the president of the supreme court stating that in april i had been reprimanded for a breach of professional ethic by the qualification commission of judge so i ha been duly punished at the very dawn of his career it appears that the lesson did him good since our office have no information about the highest judge of the region receiving any subsequent reprimand a new person became the supreme court president soon afterwards and i could feel more confident perhaps his relative at the supreme court helped to make it so a a relative so influential that he is now awaiting his appointment to the constitutional court and now is year term a judge is coming to an end new law provide for lifetime appointment by a majority vote in parliament and here our president ha made himself famous nationwide прославился на всю страну a the article then mentioned judge o whose resignation wa discussed at the same plenary sitting of parliament a is appointment but mr i is a hard nut to crack and is dreaming of keeping his post no matter what крепкий орешек и несмотря ни на что он мечтает сохранить пост a the first page of the article also contained extensive quote from article previously published in february april and may in the same newspaper in particular one dated april which discussed asset allegedly belonging to i and his relative that article contained quote from a letter of the chairman of the council of judge dated april the letter contained an acknowledgement that judge d president of the civil division of the supreme court wa the fatherinlaw of is son almost the entire second page of the article wa taken up by the verbatim reproduction of the transcript of parliament plenary sitting of january at which parliament examined question about the appointment and resignation of a number of judge according to the transcript several mp said that they had received complaint about the situation in the kherson region court i denied any wrongdoing and stated that all complaint had been checked by the appropriate authority and found baseless the head of the relevant parliamentary committee stated that the committee had also conducted an inquiry into complaint raised about i and found them to be groundless he also implied that i might have been a victim of a slander campaign orchestrated by aggrieved litigant however in view of the concern raised by several mp is candidature wa withdrawn for additional check a brief discussion followed concerning judge o from one of the district court of the kherson region who had presented her resignation to parliament one of the mp made a speech to the effect that judge o had resigned to avoid responsibility for bribery the newspaper reproduction of the transcript wa followed by the following conclusion a you can see dear reader representative of the kherson justice system have distinguished themselves twice it wa not only mr i who disgraced himself in front of the entire country a but also his subordinate from one of the district court mr is photograph wa displayed on the first page of the article covering approximately one sixth of the page he wa shown in formal attire with a neutral facial expression apparently sitting at a desk under the photograph the following caption appeared i will recompense them according to their deed old testament mr i is shown in the photo in the same issue of the newspaper another photograph of i wa published with the caption parliament so far ha not given a life sentence to the president of the kherson court of appeal the copy of the article provided to the court by the applicant company doe not contain that second photograph within the next two week other newspaper published at least three article commenting in critical term on the parliamentary session dedicated to is appointment and his activity in general domestic proceeding i brought a claim in the kherson suvorovsky district court against the applicant company seeking retraction of statement aa and compensation for nonpecuniary damage he argued that the publication in the newspaper which had a circulation of had negatively influenced his professional reputation and public opinion of the judicial system at large triggering action aimed at putting pressure on the court namely numerous demonstration outside the region courthouse the case wa tried by judge s trial judge according to the applicant company in the course of the trial it produced by way of proof of the factual ground for the impugned statement twentyfive article published in the local newspaper from to on april the applicant company lodged an application with the supreme court urging it to reassign the case in view of the plaintiff position to a court in a different region see paragraph below for the relevant domestic legal provision it argued in particular that the trial judge had previously examined a claim lodged by is son himself a vice president of a district court in kherson and had allegedly breached the law in those proceeding it also argued that a a longterm president of the kherson regional court of appeal i had supervisory function in respect of all judge in the region on april the applicant company asked the firstinstance court to postpone hearing in the case until the supreme court had ruled on it reassignment application i objected the court decided not to postpone the hearing on may the applicant company asked the court to suspend proceeding in the case under article of the code of civil procedure see paragraph below pending examination by the supreme court of it application for case reassignment the court refused the applicant company challenged the trial judge on the ground that he had rejected it request to suspend the proceeding the judge rejected the challenge on may the firstinstance court delivered it judgment allowing the claimi the court declared a the photograph and caption to them and statement aa and aa baseless insulting and damaging to is reputation and b statement a untrue and damaging to is reputationii the court ordered the applicant company to publish it judgment and awarded i ukrainian hryvnyas uah in compensation for nonpecuniary damage and uah in court fee about euro and euro eur respectively at the timeiii by way of reasoning the court stated that statement aa and aa could not be protected a value judgment since they were deliberately insulting article of the convention permitted restriction on freedom of expression for the protection of the reputation of others neither the transcript of parliament plenary sitting nor other document before the court provided a factual basis for those statementsiv the defendant had failed to prove the truth of the factual statement a or to point to the source of that informationv a to the photograph the court considered that the applicant company had failed to prove that is photograph had been taken either with his consent or at a public event while it wa established that the photograph with the biblical quote see paragraph above had been taken at an official meeting on may it presented only i and not the event in general and so wa unrelated to the event the defendant had thus exercised the choice of which fragment of the photograph to publish selecting those where only the plaintiff wa shown in a certain light combined with the caption added this demonstrated that publication of the photograph wa intended a an attack on the plaintiff honour and dignityvi the totality of the circumstance showed for the court that the applicant company purpose in publishing the impugned statement and photograph wa deliberately to damage is reputation on may the supreme court apparently unaware that the examination of the case at first instance had already been completed reassigned the case to a district court in the mykolaiv region on the ground that a judge wa a party to the proceeding the applicant company appealed against the firstinstance court judgment arguing in particular that the court had not been impartial because it had refused without giving particular reason to suspend proceeding while the reassignment application had been pending before the supreme court the applicant company also argued that the firstinstance court judgment wa contrary to article of the convention a to statement a the applicant company alleged that is daughterinlaw the wife of his son wa the daughter of d who at the time wa the president of the civil division of the supreme court the plaintiff wa not contesting that fact the use of the term perhaps in statement a showed that it had been meant to communicate that the author wa wondering whether a relative presence on the supreme court wa protecting i rather than being a positive affirmation that this wa indeed the case it wa thus a value judgment and wa true on july the supreme court reassigned the case at is request to the zaporizhzhya regional court of appeal on august the zaporizhzhya regional court of appeal varied the judgment of the firstinstance court and reaffirmed the essential part of it reasoningi the court of appeal reduced the amount awarded to uah for nonpecuniary damage and uah for court fee about eur and respectively at the time having regard to the applicant company financial situation and upheld the remainder of the firstinstance court judgmentii by way of reasoning the court of appeal stated that according to the caselaw of the european court of human right the fact that the subject of published information had public status made such person more open to criticism but did not deprive them of the right to sue to defend their reputationiii the court of appeal found unconvincing the applicant company argument that it had pursued the legitimate aim of informing the public a opposed to damaging is reputation a president of the regional court given that the impugned statement and caption to the photograph had been presented a a narrative about certain circumstance розповідь про певні обставини the firstinstance court conclusion that they could not be seen a value judgment but rather a insult had been justified an insult wa a statement made not with the purpose of communicating information but with the purpose of insulting a person in it appeal on point of law the applicant company reiterated essentially the same argument a in it previous appeal see paragraph above a to statement a the applicant company added that a letter from the chairman of the council of judge of ukraine dated april and quoted in the impugned article see paragraph above wa in the file the letter wa addressed to a certain mr b and contained a detailed response to his complaint against i the council stated in particular that the fact that d wa the father of is daughterinlaw did not mean that i had abused his position on march the odessa regional court of appeal acting a the court of cassation amended the lower court decision by rejecting is claim for damage retaining only the award of court fee see paragraph i above it held that the very fact of the decision in his favour constituted sufficient redress for i it upheld the remainder of the lower court decision it held in particular that the trial judge failure to suspend proceeding pending examination of the reassignment application by the supreme court did not constitute ground for quashing it judgment the court held that the aim of the impugned phrase had been solely to humiliate and disparage a representative of the judiciary and the phrase had made no contribution to the resolution of the problem in the administration of justice criticism of a judge wa possible in the context of a public debate on problem related to inefficiency in the judicial system or to a judge lack of independence or impartiality however the impugned article had not discussed those issue a concern the matter of impartiality of the firstinstance court judge the court of appel made no comment the court of cassation stated that the fact that that judge had refused to suspend the proceeding and had rejected the challenge against himself see paragraph above did not constitute ground for quashing the lower court decision c article b application no publication the article published in the issue of the newspaper dated may wa authored by m k who wa at the time the director of the applicant company and entitled excourt president is burying lady justice under his claim экспредседатель суда завалил фемиду исками it relevant part read claim raining down on the independent medium of the kherson region from mr i who until recently used to be president of the regional court of appeal can not be called anything other than a trend newspaper which take a consistent line in favour of a just and honest judicial system are being targeted it seems that i ha had enough of a clear and consistent position of mr s the head of the kherson city committee of the union of retired officer of the armed force and law enforcement following a defamation claim against the grivna newspaper mr i also sued the vik newspaper which had published s open letter to the regional governor s had asked the governor to state his position concerning the event which became a topic for examination in the parliament and are constantly in the newspaper in his letter the author appealed to the government representative in the hope that he would not remain an impartial observer but could influence the situation a regard justice in the region b claim of retired serviceman seeking increase in their pension to which they are entitled by law have been pending before the court of the region for two year while in other region pensioner get the money to which they are entitled by law in our region only several dozen pensioner managed to get their money why do the court work this way in our region b remarkably this publication in the vik newspaper wa not the end of contact between s and i literally day after the publication of that issue the letter writer and the judge had a conversation at the request of the latter s say that a dressingdown is the only term that can describe the tone of the conversation after this meeting the officer hope of establishing a dialogue with the judge and of clarifying the situation collapsed this wa the subject of a new open letter he addressed directly to mr i and then something totally unexpected for the retired submarine officer happened he wa attacked at night by stranger received a serious blow to the head obliging him to be hospitalised a coincidence the relevant authority could answer this question but they initially refused to register s complaint about the attack he ha not been informed about the result of the investigation bthis is the short story of the contact between s and i the final touch to the story will be a court judgment on the defamation claim the claim will be examined by the same judge st of the suvorovsky district court who surprisingly get to examine is claim in contrast to the case against our newspaper where i is seeking damage for himself in the case against vik his claim are entirely selfless he is asking that damage be paid to an orphanage charity is of course a laudable enterprise but the editorial board of both grivna and vik understand that the point of the operation is not to get some money затеяно все далеко не изза желания получить деньги bmost likely court decision in his favour would come in handy for i when parliament again examines the question of his lifetime appointment claim granted at first instance and on appeal may serve a proof for the argument that journalist unjustified attack this is how lady justice servant call our critical publication are made up and baseless b especially because judge st doe not take into account a seemingly logical idea that if one of the party is a court or a judge then the case should be examined by a higher court b domestic proceeding i brought a claim against the applicant company and k seeking retraction of statement bb and compensation for nonpecuniary damage a regard in particular statement b the plaintiff submitted that it wa based entirely on s account of the event and that the author of the article had made no attempt to obtain the version of the kherson regional court staff a far a the attack on s wa concerned the story wa presented in such a way a to generate a cheap sensation by creating the impression that i wa somehow implicated in the attack according to the applicant company in the course of the trial it produced a proof of the factual ground for the impugned statement twentyfour article published in the local newspaper from to the applicant company also produced the letter from s to the regional governor reference to which wa made in statement b and b in the letter dated february s stated that i possessed property which could not be explained by his lawful income and that the parliament had refused to appoint i on a permanent basis the region wa one of the last in ukraine in term of delivering lawful just decision in case of retired military officer who sought to defend their right to a decent pension in the court s asked the governor to explain why i wa still allowed to remain in the position of the president of the regional court and why the governor did not intervene on august the zaporizhzhya shevchenkivsky district court allowed the claim in part ordering the author of the article to apologise by retracting statement bb and the applicant company to publish the retraction in the newspaper the court awarded uah about eur at the time in compensation for nonpecuniary damage from the defendant jointly and severally to be paid to an orphanage the following element of the district court reasoning are worthy of notei referring to article of the convention the court stated that the public status of the subject of publication did not deprive them of the right to protection of their reputation even though the impugned statement constituted value judgment they were insultingii according to the caselaw of the european court of human right the fact that subject of the published information had public status made such person more open to criticism but did not deprive them of the right to sue to defend their reputationiii the impugned statement were insulting the defendant had failed to provide evidence of ground for such statement and the evidence they did provide did not contain incontrovertible fact which would allow assessment of the person of the plaintiff and the work of the court over which he presided не містять беззаперечних фактів які б дозволили оцінити особу і діяльність судуiv referring to article of the information act setting out objectivity a one of the

caselaw of the european court of human right in lingens v austria july series a no it had stressed the need to distinguish between fact and value judgment the truth of which wa not susceptible of proof at the same time the district court stressed the following quote from the same paragraph of lingens the court note in this connection that the fact on which mr lingens founded his valuejudgment

undisputedincontrovertible доказів незаперечності оцінених журналістом фактів у даній справі відповідачі суду не надали and therefore the court did not consider that they had acted in good faith in accordance with article of the information act the court concluded that the defendant intention wa not to inform the public but rather to spread negative information about the plaintiffvii the court refused to declare statement b defamatory on november the zaporizhzhya regional court of appeal upheld the judgment but modified it to the effect that damage were to be paid to i and not the orphanage

the amount of damage account being taken of the plaintiff moral suffering and disruption of his social tie including a a public official the firstinstance court had not established that the journalist

46,the applicant were born in and respectively and live in lecco the first applicant is the editor of a local online newspaper in the province of lecco the other two applicant are journalist working for the newspaper in the course of their activity the applicant used radio equipment to access frequency used by the police or the carabinieri this enabled them to learn of any communication transmitted in that way so that they could arrive quickly on the scene when wishing to report on specific incident on august the applicant listened in on a conversation during which the merate carabinieri operation centre decided to send a patrol to a location where according to anonymous source weapon had been stored illegally the carabinieri accordingly went to the location mentioned and the second and third applicant arrived on the scene immediately afterwards having obtained a search warrant the carabinieri searched the applicant car finding two frequencymodulation transmitterreceivers that were capable of intercepting police radio communication the carabinieri then went to the two journalist editorial office and seized two fixed radio receiver which were tuned to the frequency used by the carabinieri other frequency used by police operation centre were stored in the device memory a the criminal proceeding against the applicant at first instance criminal proceeding were instituted against the first and second applicant for illegally installing equipment designed to intercept communication between lawenforcement agency operation centre and patrol article bi and bi of the criminal code the third applicant wa charged with accessing the aforementioned communication article and bi of the criminal code on november the lecco district court acquitted the applicant it held that the relevant article of the criminal code were to be interpreted in the light of article of the constitution which only protected communication of a confidential nature the district court observed that the radio device used by the lawenforcement agency wa unable to ensure the confidentiality of the information it transmitted accordingly the interception of the communication in question did not constitute an offence moreover the possession and use of radio receiver were not prohibited a such b proceeding on appeal the milan principal public prosecutor and the lecco public prosecutor appealed they argued that the lecco district court interpretation wa inconsistent with the court of cassations caselaw in such matter citing in particular judgment no of january and that the communication in issue were clearly confidential bearing in mind the aim of ensuring public safety and protecting public order in addition the communication concerned the initial investigation following the commission of an offence they were therefore subject to a confidentiality requirement pursuant to article of the code of criminal procedure the confidential nature of the communication wa also obvious from the fact that the carabinieri used coded language for communication concerning the location and the type of intervention clearly seeking to ensure that no third party had knowledge of the information being exchanged in addition the radiofrequencies involved had been exclusively assigned to operation centre by the ministry of defence furthermore in order to listen in on the conversation the applicant had had to purchase special radio equipment a ordinary equipment could not be used for this purpose on the other hand the fact that such device were freely available on the market did not justify their use for intercepting conversation between lawenforcement officer in addition in accordance with presidential decree no a in force at the material time device of this kind were intended to be purchased by amateur radio operator but could not be used to intercept police radiofrequencies lastly the ministry of communication decree of february had expressly prohibited amateur radio operator from intercepting communication which they were not entitled to receive c judgment of the milan court of appeal in a judgment of may the milan court of appeal found the first and second applicant guilty and sentenced them to one year and three month imprisonment the third applicant wa sentenced to six month imprisonment the court of appeal suspended the applicant sentence it observed that article bi of the criminal code a amended by law no of november had extended the scope of criminal responsibility to cover all remote data transmission thus including the interception of conversation between the lawenforcement agency operation centre and patrol such communication were moreover clearly confidential reiterating all the argument put forward by the milan and lecco public prosecutor particularly regarding the aim of ensuring public safety and protecting public order the court of appeal held that article of the code of criminal procedure wa also at issue in the present case d proceeding in the court of cassation the applicant appealed to the court of cassation they contended that the communication in question had been transmitted on unencrypted frequency and thus could not be treated a confidential furthermore they had been acting in a professional capacity a journalist and their action were therefore justified under article of the criminal code and in term of freedom of the press in a judgment of october the court of cassation found against the applicant upholding the court of appeal position a to the confidential nature of the communication and reiterating that this interpretation wa consistent with it own approach in similar case particularly in judgment no of may and no of january addressing the applicant argument concerning freedom of the press the court of cassation stated that the right to impart information which they had relied on might have prevailed over the public interest protected by criminal law in a case of alleged defamation however that right could not take precedence in a case concerning the illegal interception of communication between lawenforcement officer the,,,
47,the applicant wa born in and life in cluj napoca he is a university professor and contributor to various magazine and newspaper mainly of an economic and financial nature at the time of the relevant event he had already published more than article in various local or national publication prior to parliamentary election held at the end of november the applicant wrote an article about mii who wa standing a a candidate for one of the national party the article headlined attention he also want to be in parliament wa published on the front page of f a newspaper on november it read a follows after five round of free parliamentary election ordinary people who are politically active only when they vote have come to an uncontroversial conclusion there is something wrong with people who become candidate for various political function without even knowing exactly what is wrong most people of good moral and professional character often choose not to vote any more they make that choice especially when they learn that the person appearing on the electoral poster asking for vote ha never done anything remarkable in his or her profession it is therefore no longer surprising that the romanian parliament is the institution that enjoys the least public confidence time ha consolidated the public belief that most candidate want to become parliamentarian so that they can for a couple of year take advantage of the privilege they grant themselves or of those informal benefit which come through the development of the system of relationship associated with their function there are candidate who do everything to become parliamentarian in order to shield their criminal record from the criminal act they committed before becoming senator or deputy among the many case of that type i today present you one and if i do this it is not to help the voter because imposture by an individual reveals itself without reserve to the perceptive mass whereas one by a group or party doe not especially when one can use all the presidential and municipal logistical power impressive amount of fund and an unsuspected power to persuade individual with little training one such case is that of mr mii this gentleman is in good physical condition especially after living a comfortable life a a manager at r cluj a public company and now want to use his skill in parliament and he doe not intend to reach such a position only based on his wellknown lucidity but also with the help of some financial support for the intellectual effort he wish to make for the benefit of the many for that purpose he borrowed billion romanian lei for a period of month namely until october to invest on the stock market and earn a bit more than the creditor would request a interest based on perfectly legal document it is just that at one point the moral profile of this representative of the democratic party of cluj showed itself clearly not having made a much profit a he hoped the candidate mii decided not to repay the loan thus contracted after imploring the creditor to have mercy to postpone and not enforce the contract even though he know that the contract weighs against him he is relying on that defect of romanian justice of postponing the adjudication of case in fact mr mii brought a case before a court which had no jurisdiction to ass the case but he hope in the near future to be able to invoke his immunity a a member elected by the nation just like his spiritual guardian who left u without a maritime fleet that is why i say that we must be careful about what mr mii sign and promise for the following day he might no longer admit to anything he may switch to another political party if he is given more he may even sell part of the electoral district where he ran and if nobody want it he can go to smirnov because it is warmer in tiraspol than in huedin on april mii brought a civil action against the applicant he sought euro eur for nonpecuniary damage a the article had allegedly seriously affected his reputation and made him lose the election by approximately one hundred vote mii also complained about the publication by the applicant of another defamatory article on january which wa in a similar vein he also complained about the distribution of leaflet before the election which had reproduced the content of the article of november he alleged that all the material had been meant to discredit him a a candidate the applicant confirmed that he wa the author of the article in question and that everything he had written had been true a proved by document from the arbitration tribunal of the cluj chamber of commerce which would become available to the court he further denied contributing in any way to the publication or distribution of other article and leaflet concerning mii on july the cluj napoca court of first instance allowed the claim lodged by mii and held that the article of november had contained defamatory statement about him it further held the applicant liable to pay eur for nonpecuniary damage and romanian lei ron in legal cost the court held that the applicant had not proved that his statement were true the procedure before the arbitration tribunal invoked by the applicant in his defence had concerned a commercial dispute between mii and the applicant brokerage company in which the claim of mii had been partially granted on april a the repayment deadline had been set for april the court considered that even if true the applicant statement had been defamatory and should not have been made public in the medium especially since they concerned matter of a private commercial nature the court further noted that the applicant statement had been reproduced in electoral leaflet which had been distributed in several public place in bus station and private mailbox the court held that even if it wa not the applicant who had produced or distributed the leaflet there wa a causal link between the publication of the article and the harm caused to miis reputation because if he had not produced his article in the first place there would have been no leaflet and no amplification of the negative effect on miis image the court then focused on the term used by the applicant in his article in particular calling the defendant an impostor which wa found to be insulting and lacking factual justification a there existed no criminal complaint of fraud against mii it concluded that the language used conveying the idea that mii would accept any compromise for money and would therefore betray the electorate his party and his country had exceeded the limit of admissible criticism and had disparaged him the applicant appealed arguing before the cluj county court that the publication of the article in question during a parliamentary election campaign had had the role of informing the public in good faith about a political figure in such a situation the limit of admissible criticism were wider he argued that during election campaign the press had the essential role of informing the public about future member of the romanian parliament he argued that the amount of damage awarded by the firstinstance court had been disproportionate and had had an obvious punitive purpose in a final judgment of january the county court essentially upheld the reasoning of the lower court it considered that the manner in which the applicant had acted proved that he had not complied with the duty and responsibility inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression the seriousness of his allegation and of the act imputed to mii hold him the applicant responsible for showing the highest rigour and a special caution the lack of which would breach the right of others the county court confirmed that the lower court had correctly estimated that it had been necessary to balance the right to private life on the one hand and freedom of expression which contributed to a debate of public interest on the other holding that to insult to defame a person can not be justified and legitimate when one party aim to unilaterally expose in the press private litigation of a commercial nature involving two private party in assessing the existing conflict between the exercise of freedom of expression in the press and the necessity to protect the reputation and the right of others the court estimate that even though the applicant allegation made in a press article during an electoral campaign concerned a potential member of the romanian parliament thus were of public interest there are limitation to freedom of expression the applicant having been bound to act within the limit given by the public interest in protecting the reputation and the right of another person including his or her right to be presumed innocent undoubtedly when the article wa published in the newspaper f the applicant did not comply with the minimum requirement of diligence prescribed by article of the convention in the sense of acting in good faith and in accordance with the journalistic ethic so a to ensure that the provided information be trustworthy notwithstanding the dose of exaggeration or provocation allowed in such situation nevertheless the county court allowed the applicant appeal in part and reduced the damage to eur considered to be more proportionate to the damage sustained by miiii relevant

by the swiss authority b former wife had then contacted the applicant asking him to help b they had met with the applicant who had indicated that he could establish contact with someone who could

day later in respect of count the applicant wa convicted of assisted suicide committed between july and august c wa year old she suffered from many infirmity but wa not seriously ill she wished to end her life and had procured the necessary pill herself on july she had contacted the applicant by email and asked for his assistance the applicant and c had exchanged at least nine email between july and august on july the applicant had asked c which medication she had procured on july the applicant had confirmed that the medication at her disposal were excellent and also recommended that she look at the general guide on how to commit suicide which wa available on the website of the network on july he wa helping her finding the general guide on august he confirmed that it wa a good idea to combine the medication with a plastic bag over her head in which connection he had written if you are able to go through with it you will be certain remember in that case that it is necessary to put a rubber band around the neck on august c had been found dead in her bed with a plastic bag over her head in it judgment of september the supreme court stated liability for assisted suicide or attempt at assisted suicide by the high court judgment the applicant wa found guilty on two count of violation of section of the penal code for assisted suicide and one count of an attempt at assisted suicide this case concern whether according to the finding of fact of the high court the act performed by the applicant a described in the three count are punishable because they are considered assistance a set out in the provision and whether the condition for imposing a sentence for the attempt have been met in that case there is also the issue of the length of the sentence it is a punishable offence under section of the penal code to assist another person in ending his or her life but it is not a punishable offence to attempt to take one own life accordingly this provision independently criminalises assisted suicide the supreme court find that it will be determined based on an interpretation of this provision what kind of assistance fall within the scope of the liability for which reason it is not possible simply to use a a basis those kind of complicity that are punishable under the general rule of law set out in section of the penal code a complicity in offence minor assistance may fall outside the scope of criminal offence under section a regard count the applicant ha been found guilty of violation of section of the penal code because he procured medication for b prior to b death on may knowing full well that the medication were intended for his suicide a regard count the applicant ha been found guilty of attempted violation of section because he procured medication for a knowing full well that the medication were intended for a suicide which suicide failed however the supreme court concurs in the finding that the applicant act a described in count and count are punishable a assisted suicide a set out in section of the penal code a regard count the supreme court concurs in the finding that the condition for sentencing someone for an attempt have been met a the maximum penalty under section of a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three year make it possible to sanction attempt see section of the penal code the applicant submission concerning the legislative history of section can not lead to a different conclusion a regard count the applicant ha been found guilty of having in email exchanged with c advised her about suicide method including by confirming the choice of medication and by confirming that it wa a good idea to combine them with a plastic bag and by writing if you are able to go through with it you will be certain remember in that case that it is necessary to put a rubber band around the neck thereby he assisted her in committing suicide by taking medicine and putting a plastic bag over her head and closing it with a rubber band opinion of three judge concerning count we concur in the finding that by giving advice in his email exchange with c the applicant assisted her in a specific and significant way in committing suicide and that the advice is not exempt from punishment due to the circumstance that his advice wa based on a general guide that had lawfully been uploaded to the website of physician in favour of euthanasia in this context we have also taken into account that the specific advice offered by the applicant to c wa suited to a greater extent than the general guide to intensifying her desire to commit suicide in our opinion there is no basis for finding that it would be contrary to article of the european convention on human right to convict the defendant on this count opinion of two judge concerning count it appears from the case file that c contacted the applicant in july and indicated in her email that she wa year old and suffered from many infirmity that she wished to end soon and that thing had been clarified with her close family she had procured the necessary pill and her intention wa also to combine them with a plastic bag she wa very frightened of the potential risk that she would fail and she wa nervous a to whether she would be able to go through with it on her own the applicant then passed on information from the lawful guide on the website but he did not pas on any information not already available from the website he neither advocated nor encouraged her to commit suicide in these circumstance we find that the information given by the applicant to c wa not of such a nature that the information can independently be considered to constitute a punishable act of assistance in her ending her life accordingly we find that the applicant must be acquitted on this count of violation of section of the penal code which must also be considered to accord best with article of the european convention on human right on the right to receive and give information see in this respect the judgment delivered on october by the european court of human right in case and open door and dublin well woman v ireland the supreme court by a majority of three judge sentenced the applicant to day imprisonment suspended it wa taken into account a an aggravating circumstance that to a certain extent the act were committed in a systematic manner and that the applicant had been charged on three count the last act being committed after he had been provisionally charged by the police for violation of section of the penal code it wa considered a mitigating circumstance that the applicant wa almost year old the minority of two judge found that the applicant should have a suspended sentence of imprisonment for a term of day since count wa merely an attempt and under count he had not assisted to a significant extent moreover the minority of the judge found that the act had not been committed in a systematic manner relevant legal framework and practice the relevant provision of the penal code straffeloven read a follows section act aimed at inciting or assisting the commission of an offence are punishable a attempt if the offence is not completed the penalty prescribed for an offence may be reduced for attempt especially where an attempt reflects little strength or persistence of criminal intent unless otherwise provided attempt will only be punished if the offence is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding four month section the penalty provided for an offence applies to everybody who is complicit in the act by incitement aiding or abetting the punishment may be reduced where a person intended only to provide minor assistance or support an intent already formed and where the offence ha not been completed or intentional complicity failed the punishment may also be reduced where a person is complicit in the breach of a special duty to which he is not subject unless otherwise provided the punishment for complicity in offence that do not carry a sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding four month may be remitted where the accomplice intended only to provide minor assistance or support an intent already formed and where his complicity wa due to negligence section any person who kill another at such other person explicit request is sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three year section any person who assist someone in deliberately ending his life is sentenced to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three year assisted suicide ha been criminalised since section of the penal code wa given it current wording by act no of march in november the ministry of justice requested the standing committee on the criminal code straffelovrådet which is an advisory body tasked with making recommendation on legislative issue related to criminal law issue of principle relating to the stipulation of administrative criminal law provision and the implementation in practice of crime policy measure to consider the issue of whether to criminalise also general encouragement of suicide or suicide recipe not aimed at specific person in it report no the said committee did not recommend the criminalisation of general encouragement to suicide in respect of the scope of section of the penal code it stated a follows it is not a punishable offence to attempt to take one own life but it is a punishable offence under section of the penal code to assist another person in ending his or her life the maximum sentence is a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three year the offence is consummated when the victim dy depending on the circumstance it is possible to sentence a person for an attempt at assisting another person in ending his or her life see section read with section of the penal code attempt comprise any act aimed at inciting or assisting in the commission of an offence see pp ff of the annotated criminal code den kommenterede straffelov on general rule the question is whether section only applies to physical and mental assistance of a qualified nature or whether in accordance with the general danish law rule on complicity set out in section of the penal code the provision also applies if the offender by incitement aiding or abetting deliberately assist a particular person in committing suicide see pp ff on general rule and p on special rule of the annotated criminal code for an act to be punishable under section it is required in any circumstance that the offender must have performed a specific act of assistance with the intent that one or more specific person commit suicide encouragement of suicide and description of method to commit suicide do not fall within the scope of section if not directed at specific person therefore the presentation or dissemination of suicide recipe through internet website or the like can not normally be punished under section a mentioned above a person can be sentenced for assistance under section of the criminal code only if the purpose of the offence of assistance is a specific act of assistance the issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide ha regularly been the subject of public and political debate in denmark but so far there ha not been a political majority in parliament in favour of amending section of the penal code the issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide ha also been considered by the council of ethic det etiske råd the council of ethic is an independent body established in to advise parliament minister and public authority on ethical issue in

which had ruled that the maintenance of a prohibition of assisted suicide wa unconstitutional in parliament amended the danish health care act sundhedsloven enhancing patient right to refuse treatment including lifesustaining treatment which mean that a patient who ha come to term with circumstance and doe not want any lifesustaining treatment can refuse the treatment offered even though the consequence of withdrawing from lifesustaining treatment is that the patient will die right away moreover a system of living will ha been set up under which individual can make binding advance

50,the applicant wa born in and life in toruń the applicant is a publicist and a professor of sociology a the statement in issue on january rzeczpospolita a national daily newspaper published an article titled zybertowicz so far to the third polish republic zybertowicz na razie dla iii rp the article contained information about three civil lawsuit against the applicant instituted by am the editorinchief of one of the biggest daily newspaper gazeta wyborcza and a certain m and z the article also included a comment by the applicant on the lawsuit in question in a way it is quite interesting to note who ha lodged civil claim against me so far two agent and one their fierce defender swoją drogą to ciekawe kto mnie dotychczas pozwał do sądu dwóch agentów i jeden ich zaciekły obrońca b civil proceeding against the applicant on march am brought a civil action in the warsaw regional court sąd okręgowy requesting legal protection of his personal right he asked that the applicant be ordered to publish an apology and to pay damage of polish zloty pln approximately euro eur to a charity on april the warsaw regional court transferred the case to the toruń regional court on august the warsaw court of appeal sąd apelacyjny quashed this decision on june the warsaw regional court gave judgment and partly allowed the plaintiff claim it ordered the applicant to publish an apology on the first second or third page of rzeczpospolita it further determined the exact size and wording of the apology the court also ordered the applicant to pay pln approximately eur to a charity and pln approximately eur in court fee during the proceeding the court questioned the applicant and the plaintiff the applicant argued that the phrase in question had represented his opinion about am public statement referring to several published statement and excerpt from article written by am the applicant claimed that he had had a good factual basis for giving this opinion of am view about lustration the court also obtained an opinion from an expert on linguistics the expert wa asked in particular to reply to the question of whether the phrase two agent and one their fierce defender in the context of the case constituted a statement of fact or an opinion in his opinion of may the expert stated that the phrase in question had been a statement of fact and not a hypothesis or supposition in addition taking into account the reader presumed general knowledge it wa obvious that am had been identified in the article a having defended two agent the plaintiff submitted to the court a second expert report dated january in which another expert on language analysis confirmed that the applicant statement had been a statement of fact the warsaw regional court noted that the applicant when formulating the statement in question referred in particular to a number of published statement made by am in which he had criticised the lustration law the applicant also relied on an earlier warsaw court of appeal judgment confirming that z had indeed collaborated under communism with the security service the court further held that everyone including those not following the news carefully wa aware that m and z had been accused of collaborating with the security service in particular reader of rzeczpospolita should have been aware of that fact a the newspaper had published numerous article on the issue the warsaw regional court also held that judging by both the applicant statement and the whole article it did not appear that am had been an agent while the applicant in his statement had not specified who in his opinion had been an agent and who their fierce defender from the nature of the publication and taking into account the reader general knowledge it wa clear that it wa the plaintiff who wa considered to be the fierce defender of two agent at the same time the court accepted that had the applicant used a more general formulation and referred only to am attitude towards the lustration law such word could have fallen within the limit of acceptable criticism and it would not have been necessary to protect am personal right lastly the court considered that from the published statement and quote from am public statement which the applicant had submitted during the proceeding it did not appear that am had ever actually defended those two particular person in conclusion the court held that am personal right had been breached but only partially for this reason the court considered that the plaintiff claim had been exaggerated therefore it lowered the sum to be paid to the charity both party appealed on march the warsaw court of appeal modified the firstinstance judgment and ordered the applicant to pay pln approximately eur to the charity and pln approximately eur in court fee the applicant wa also ordered to publish an apology in rzeczpospolita the court in principle agreed with the reasoning presented by the regional court it held that while the phrase fierce defender of two agent had breached am personal right it wa not defamatory the court further agreed with the regional court that the applicant had named am a having defended two particular person however he had failed to prove that his statement had been true consequently the court considered that the phrase used by the applicant had breached the plaintiff personal right in particular his good name and had conflicted with the value espoused by him the court referred to the ongoing public debate in poland about the necessity of lustration in order to explain and disclose the role of various special service after the world war ii it noted that in the context of that debate the phrase that someone wa a fierce defender of agent suggested that that person had defended them justified their action and searched for a way to absolve them from any responsibility in the eye of the public consequently attributing to someone the role of fierce defender of agent wa a breach of that person good name and suggested that that person behaviour had been contrary to the public good the court also held that the phrase in question had been a statement of fact however it considered that there had been no basis for concluding that am had defended any agent or more generally defended activity of the communist secret service that had been harmful to the public on the contrary he had firmly condemned such activity he had objected to lustration being understood a a tool to destroy people and being used a an argument in political game with reference to the sum to be paid to the charity the court noted that the applicant wa a highly educated university professor holding numerous public office a person in the applicant situation should have been aware of how his statement would have been understood by an average reader of rzeczpospolita and whether there wa any basis for attributing to someone the role of fierce defender of agent the court further held that the sum of pln to be paid to charity wa symbolic and that pln wa a more appropriate sum given the circumstance of the case especially considering that it wa not an excessive burden for the applicant the applicant lodged a cassation appeal in particular he referred to article of the convention on march the supreme court sąd najwyższy refused to entertain the applicant cassation appeal on account of the lack of important legal issue to be considered in the case the court relying on article of the convention noted that freedom of expression did not have an absolute character it further referred to it own caselaw according to which the necessity to prove that a statement of fact wa true wa not an excessive requirement and did not infringe the freedom of political debate c enforcement proceeding on april am representative instituted enforcement proceeding in the warsaw district court aimed at compelling the applicant to comply with the obligation imposed by the warsaw court of appeal judgment of march on june the warsaw district court ordered the applicant to publish the apology ordered by the warsaw court of appeal in rzeczpospolita after the applicant failed to comply

requirement that paid advertisement to be published in the press had to comply with were the law and principle of social coexistence zasady współżycia społecznego the editor of rzeczpospolita had been aware of the content of the book publishing the advertisement could have been regarded a endorsing that content which in turn could have been seen a breaching the personal right of third party this could have given rise to civil liability on their part not only were the editor allowed to refuse publication of an advertisement in breach of third party right they were even obliged to do so the applicant appealed referring to his right to freedom of expression he also argued that the firstinstance court had failed to provide any explanation a to why and how the advertisement breached third party right the warsaw court of appeal by a judgment of november allowed his appeal and remitted the case for reexamination the court first held that publication of advertisement wa not covered by freedom of expression it further accepted the applicant argument about the lower court failure to give adequate reason for it judgment that court had held that the text of the advertisement wa in

content of the book concerned this wa not correct a under section of the press act lawfulness andor respect for third party personal right had to be examined with reference to the content of the

applicant claim the court wa of the view that the advertisement wa incompatible with the newspaper editorial profile it further reiterated that the publication of the advertisement could have been understood a an endorsement of the applicant view expressed in the book this circumstance alone wa sufficient to justify the refusal to publish the advertisement moreover rzeczpospolita and gazeta wyborcza were competitor in the press market the publication of the advertisement could have given rise to a suspicion that the editor of the former were trying to denigrate the latter in the eye of the public further the editor were not obliged by law to endorse the dissemination of view and statement which they did not accept the court concluded that the advertisement did not meet the requirement laid down by section of the press act the court further stated referring to the view expressed by the supreme court in it judgment of january given in other case brought by the applicant and concerning refusal to publish the same advertisement see paragraph below that the principle of commercial and contractual freedom dictated that a publisher wa not under a legal obligation to publish all advertisement submitted to it because it did not have a monopoly on the market the applicant appealed reiterating his earlier argument he expressly relied on article of the convention on

below i csk and the polityka case it observed that the press market wa governed by business and commercial freedom it resulted therefrom that publisher of newspaper could not be held to be obliged to publish all advertisement simply at the request of client the court referred to the court judgment in the case of appleby and others v the united kingdom no echr vii it shared the court view that the principle governing the exercise of the freedom of expression were also applicable to commercial speech however it did not necessarily result therefrom that in horizontal relation this freedom could not be limited in compliance with the constitutional principle of proportionality whereas it wa true that section paragraph of the press act could not be said to be fully consistent with other provision of that act it could validly be relied on by publisher wishing to refuse the publication of an advertisement if they were of the view that the advertisement a proposed wa not compatible with the newspaper profile the supreme court concluded that the contested judgment wa ultimately in conformity with the law ii relevant domestic law and practice article of the constitution provides freedom to express opinion and to acquire and disseminate information shall be ensured to everyone preventive censorship of mean of social communication and licensing of the press shall be prohibited article of the constitution read freedom of the person shall receive legal protection everyone shall respect the freedom and right of others no one shall be compelled to do that which is not required by law any limitation upon the exercise of constitutional freedom and right may be imposed only by statute and only when necessary in a democratic state for the protection of it security or public order or to protect the natural environment health or public moral or the freedom and right of other person such limitation shall not violate the essence of freedom and right section of the press act

form a to make it clear that they are not to be identified with the editorial content the publisher and editor shall have the right to refuse the publication of an advertisement if it content or form is incompatible with the editorial profile or character of the newspaper in a decision of october czp the supreme court examined a legal question submitted to it by the warsaw court of appeal in the applicant case against nasz dziennik in it request the court of appeal summarised the difficulty arising in connection with the interpretation of section of the press act on the one hand section provided in paragraph that newspaper publisher had a right to publish advertisement this formulation suggested that they were free to decide on the choice of advertisement to be published on the other hand the provision of paragraph and of that section in so far a they defined situation where a publisher could refuse to publish an advertisement suggested that such refusal wa possible only where that advertisement a proposed failed to meet the requirement laid down in those provision otherwise publisher were obliged under the provision to publish an advertisement a long a it had been duly paid for this conclusion wa further strengthened by the fact that under paragraph of section of the act publisher did not bear any legal responsibility for the content of paid advertisement the court of appeal noted in it question that the freedom of expression of the person trying to place an advertisement had to be weighed against the publisher commercial freedom it further observed that if decisive weight wa given to the publisher freedom to choose the advertisement to be published a form of unlimited control of content by private commercial entity could result comparable to preventive censorship the supreme court endorsed the reasoning of the requesting court that section of the press act could and indeed did give rise to discrepancy in it judicial interpretation a literal interpretation a contrario indicated that a refusal to publish an advertisement wa justified only when one of the four condition laid down in paragraph and wa not fulfilled had the legislator accepted that publisher were completely free in deciding whether to publish an advertisement or to refuse it publication it would have been redundant to list the requirement that an advertisement had to comply with in order to be published hence the majority of legal writer were of the view which wa apparently also shared by the requesting court of appeal that this provision of the press act limited the publisher freedom in respect of commercial advertisement the supreme court expressed the view that it wa difficult to accept such an opinion it observed that many argument could be adduced in support of a contrary opinion however in the circumstance of the case it wa not necessary for that court to give a reply to the legal question posed by the court of appeal a such a reply wa not necessary for a decision on the merit of the case the outcome of the case pending before the court of appeal hinged only on that court assessment of whether the advertisement a proposed wa in breach of the applicable law not on the clarification of the scope of the publisher duty to publish a paid advertisement the supreme court made similar observation a to the interpretation of section of the press act in it two judgment given on january concerning the applicant case i csk and the applicant claim to have the advertisement published wa rejected in both case the,,,
52,the applicant wa born in and life in vienna at the time of the event the applicant worked for the association asyl in not which offer legal and social support to asylum seeker and refugee in an amendment to a number of law concerning the status of foreigner and of asylum seeker and concerning relevant proceeding fremdenrechtspaket wa drafted and adopted by parliament the amendment entered into force on january on december the then federal minister for interior affair lp died unexpectedly of an aneurysm at the age of on january the applicant published a statement on the association website entitled one le whats coming now eine weniger wa kommt danach it continued the good news for the new year lp minister for torture and deportation is dead die gute meldung zum jahresbeginn lp bundesministerin für folter und deportation ist tot after referring to some specific individual story of asylum seeker the text stated further that mr p wa a desk war criminal just like many others there have been in the atrocious history of this country completely desensitised indifferent to the consequence of their law and regulation the compliant instrument of a bureaucracy contaminated with racism no decent human is shedding tear over her death lp war eine schreibtischtäterin wie e viele gab in der grausamen geschichte diesis landes völlig abgestumpft gleichgültig gegen die folgen ihrer gesetze und erlässe ein willfähiges werkzeug einer rassistisch verseuchten beamtenschaft kein anständiger mensch weint ihr eine träne nach the applicant concluded the text by suggesting that their goal for the new year wa to fight for a new minister who would make good the damage done by lp so that austria could return to being a country welcoming asylum seeker and a place where human right were respected gp the late minister husband filed a private prosecution privatanklage for defamation against the applicant and the association on september the vienna regional court landesgericht für strafsachen wien convicted the applicant of defamation in respect of the abovequoted passage of the statement and sentenced him to a fine in the amount of eur half of the fine wa suspended for three year it dismissed gps request for recognition of the association liability for it employee action the court found that the average reader would understand the relevant passage of the statement to mean that lp had ordered or tolerated the torture pending expulsion or the deportation of detainee and had violated human right the word torture in particular implied the intentional infliction of physical or psychological suffering an average reader would also place the word deportation deportation in the context of the historical event under the nationalsocialist regime which forcefully deported segregated group of people to ghetto and camp to subject them to forced labour or extermination the statement in question suggested that lp exercised her political function in a particularly despicable way that she wa indifferent to official criminal abuse of authority in relation to asylum seeker and that her action were motivated by racist sadistic xenophobic and nationalsocialist attitude the publication of the statement had triggered considerable reaction from the medium and the public the applicant had been criticised a tactless and disrespectful in response thereto on january the applicant published in a daily newspaper a reply in which he stated that his comment had been directed solely towards lp and he apologised to her family member who were not responsible for the late minister inhumane policy the regional court acknowledged that a criminal charge of defamation wa at odds with the right to freedom of expression a guaranteed by the convention it found that the voicing of opinion by refugee association criticising politician and their legislative project represented an important corrective element and that the limit of acceptable criticism were particularly widely drawn in the context of the present case however in the court opinion the published statement overstepped the limit of acceptable criticism the legislative background to the amendment of the law governing foreigner and asylum seeker and the fact that criticism wa allowed to be shocking still could not justify positioning lp in a nationalsocialist and racist context and suggesting that she had tolerated the intentional physical illtreatment of detainee pending expulsion or deportation such accusation against the then only recently passed away lp together with the acclamation of her death and the call on decent people not to mourn her passing clearly went beyond the limit of acceptable criticism in a democratic society moreover the allegation made by the applicant had not been proven to be true nor had he shown any journalistic diligence in that regard the applicant filed an appeal on point of law and fact and also appealed against the sentence on may the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht wien dismissed his appeal referring to the reasoning of the firstinstance court it conceded that the word deportation nowadays had acquired the additional meaning of expulsion or removal and wa not only used in the context of the nationalsocialist regime but also in the context of the forced expulsion of foreigner however the context of the word in which it had been used a desk war criminal just like many others there have been in the atrocious history of this country acted a a reminder of the nationalsocialist history of the country therefore even though the statement at issue were political value judgment politische wertungen the applicant had not produced any proof of a factual basis for his allegation the applicant had further argued that following the caselaw of the european court of human right and of the domestic court with regard to article the impugned statement wa covered by freedom of expression the court of appeal however found that even such caselaw did not provide carte blanche for the applicant to make comparison with the nationalsocialist regime without any factual basis that decision wa served on the applicant counsel on june on november the applicant lodged a request for the renewal of the criminal proceeding erneuerung de strafverfahrens pursuant to article a of the code of criminal procedure with the aim of having the proceeding reopened and the conviction set aside on october the supreme court dismissed the request it stated that the admittedly broad limit of tolerable criticism in the political discourse did not cover excessive value judgment without any factual basis statement made in even heated political conflict needed to respect a minimum of decency and moderation in the present case the supreme court found that the evaluation by the court had rightly led to the conclusion that the text in question justified the limitation of the applicant right to freedom of expression the value judgment suggesting criminal behaviour on the part of lp had no factual basis the court had not misjudged the considerable public interest in the discussion concerning migration and asylum policy however the applicant statement had not contributed to that public discussion since they were directed at defaming and discrediting the late minister the court further noted that the sanction imposed wa in view of the disrespectful statement and their temporal proximity to lp death appropriate and even moderate the supreme court decision wa served on the applicant counsel on november ii relevant domestic law article of the criminal code strafgesetzbuch defines defamation a follows a it may be perceived by a third party anyone who make an accusation against another of having a contemptible

53,in and life in bucharest the applicant wa represented by mr cl popescu a lawyer practising in bucharest the government were represented successively by their agent m c brumar mr v mocanu and m sm teodoroiu of the romanian ministry of foreign affair background to the case the applicant is a judge attached to the bucharest court of appeal in march the applicant wrote an article about the president of the court of cassation under the heading nothing about how a comrade prosecutor ha become the president of all judge it read to my great grandfather no killed by the communist in when the communist camp wa becoming more unbearable the current president of the court of cassation wa appointed prosecutor in the town where i wa born the town had a steel industry and a shipyard and therefore wa crawling with member of the securitate from small informant to the most privileged and smooth torturer i wa twelve year old and i wa in the sixth grade because she wa almost always at work and in order to spend a much time a possible with u my mother used to take me and my younger brother to the parade on august once we were taken to a stadium to see nicolae ceauşescu who had travelled to our town by helicopter i remember that we stood for countless hour under the scorching sun there were many people in shabby clothes all of u were standing upright repeating the slogan next to me a woman wa only mouthing the ovation because she wa so tired so when i turned my head under the scorching sun i saw a man grabbing her arm and telling her discreetly to follow him only because she had mouthed the word i wa no longer interested in seeing the great leader we left and after we had left the stadium well behind i kept asking my mum why meanwhile the president of the court of cassation wa a rising prosecutor how did the comrade prosecutor fight to root out the enemy of the socialist order and for the pursuit of the new man naturally with her weapon the case file i started to imagine what could happen in the dungeon from where some came out dishonoured broken and scared and many did not come out alive who wa hurting them what did those who got hurt and those who were hurting them looked like where are the mark even today there is no desire to find out afterwards in the seventh grade during my internship in agriculture i saw female detainee on the field where we were harvesting tomato they were wearing a thick uniform with a striped skirt and a scarf on their head i wanted to memorise one of their face the detainee status seemed incompatible to me with being a woman they were cry and asking u to come near them a if we had been their own child other woman appeared authoritarian dressed in uniform fitted with leather belt my mum told me that many of them had been convicted for abortion woman chose to kill their unborn because they did not have the mean to raise them in addition to this internal turmoil they were being hunted down by the police miliție and the prosecutor how did the comrade prosecutor manage at that time naturally still for the pursuit of the new man for me the world that had already taken shape consisted of severe poverty the silence and terror from the earth surface and the unknown hell from the dungeon from where scream were never heard the prosecutor were somewhere above in an untouchable shining world which made it impossible to see the sky for all those in my world all these comrade usurper of christ and his law sternly guarded the communist prison the comrade prosecutor ha also floated above u omnipresent for fourteen year until when she transformed into a judge that is to say when i wa twentysix year old during all this time i did my homework by candlelight the candle glued to the edge of a jarfood wa rationed cold water only ran for two hour a day warm water wa long gone we shivered with cold indoors we waited at bus stop until we were freezing and afterwards we were lucky if we found room on the bus footboard to go to school now i realise that all this time long a my entire childhood and adolescence ha not been wasted because the comrade prosecutor ha accomplished so much a to become the president of all judge herself the president of the country appointed her in in a european state where the justice system is continuously being reformed that is to say to the old man a new face that is why the result is and will be an eternal failure the applicant name wa in the byline which also stated that she wa a judge attached to the bucharest court of appeal the article wa printed both in a national newspaper cotidianul and on an internet news site juridicero disciplinary and codeofconduct proceeding against the applicant disciplinary proceeding against the applicant on march the judicial investigation unit inspecția judiciară the ij attached to the superior council of the judiciary consiliul superior al magistraturii the csm opened a preliminary investigation against the applicant on it own motion on the ground that the article published by her wa referring to the professional career of the president of the court of cassation on april the ij produced a note concerning the article published by the applicant and proposed that the note be forwarded to the disciplinary commission for judge comisia de disciplină pentru judecători the cdj attached to the csm to establish whether a disciplinary investigation had to be opened against the applicant for breaching article a of law no concerning conduct of judge and prosecutor affecting their professional honour and dignity the ij held that the article had drawn a parallel between the oppression of the communist regime and the rise of the president of the court of cassation who had worked a a prosecutor at that time judge lds had been appointed president of the court of cassation in lawfully after she had passed the lawfully required vetting process to ensure that she had not been a member of or had collaborated with the secret service before suggesting that she had behaved inappropriately at the time when she had been a prosecutor without providing specific fact had made it impossible for the ij to verify the allegation the article the applicant had put her name to had introduced the idea that judge lds had carried out her professional duty unlawfully between and when she had worked a a prosecutor the distorted presentation of judge ldss professional activity and the suggestion of questionable moral behaviour on her part had resulted in the president of the court of cassations professional reputation being damaged the applicant personal opinion expressed in the article had constituted behaviour calling into question the honour and professional integrity of judge lds under relevant national and international law free speech wa subject to exception when a person right to honour reputation and personal image were affected also when exercising it judge had to behave in such a way a to preserve the dignity of their office and the independence and impartiality of the judiciary by expressing publicly her opinion about the professional activity of a judge the applicant had breached the boundary of the duty of discretion which had implied moderation and restraint in presenting her opinion the ij took the view that in the applicant case there had been evidence suggesting that the disciplinary offence set out in article a of law no had been committed it considered that the boundary of the right to freedom of expression had been overstepped and that the applicant assessment of the court of cassations president professional activity had been conducted in a manner capable of creating a negative image about the way she had behaved a a prosecutor on april the cdj ordered that a disciplinary investigation be initiated against the applicant for the disciplinary offence set out in article a of law no on may the ij produced a note about the outcome of the disciplinary investigation concerning the applicant and proposed that the note be forwarded to the cdj to establish whether disciplinary proceeding had to be instituted against the applicant by relying on some of the argument of the note of april see paragraph above the ij took the view that there wa evidence in the case that might suggest that the element of the disciplinary offence set out in article a of law no had been met in the applicant case on may the cdj closed the proceeding against the applicant in so far a they concerned the commission by the applicant of the alleged disciplinary offence set out in article a of law no however the cdj referred the case to the judge section of the csm secția pentru judecători a consiliului superior al magistraturii the sjcsm for it to determine whether the applicant had breached article of the code of conduct for judge the code it held that article a of law no concerned circumstance where a judge or prosecutor had affected his or her own professional honour and dignity or the reputation of the justice system by his or her own action and conduct this had not been the applicant case her article had been written in a literary manner had referred to aspect of the communist era which had been well known and had reflected the restriction imposed on the right of the people during those time which the applicant had been recalling the article had also contained accurate information concerning the fact that judge lds had worked a a prosecutor and a a judge and that starting from she had been appointed president of the court of cassation the applicant had not used violent or foul language capable of disturbing public opinion and her article had not had a significant medium impact however the manner in which the applicant article had been written had created a negative image of how judge lds had carried out her duty a a prosecutor during communism by using the expression comrade prosecutor in the title of the article the applicant had implied that the president of the court of cassation had been at fault for having become the president of all judge even though she had been a prosecutor during the communist regime by contrasting the situation of the people who were poor silent and oppressed with that of the prosecutor lds who wa characterised untouchable and rising the applicant had practically held lds guilty for the fact that she had had a superior status because of her position a a prosecutor also from the content of the article it could be understood that the case file processed by lds during communism had been used a a mean of oppression in order to root out the enemy of the socialist order and for the pursuit of the new man or to convict woman for abortion in addition the applicant stated generically in the article that all these comrade implying also the comrade prosecutor mentioned in the title of the article had been usurper of christ and his law and had sternly guarded the communist prison lastly the article noted ldss appointment a president of the court of cassation and referred to the fourteen year she had worked a a prosecutor during the communist regime when she ha accomplished so much a to become the president of all judge herself the cdj took the view that by writing the article in the abovementioned manner the applicant had brought into question her compliance with the relevant legal provision concerning the professional conduct of legal professional by relying on amongst other thing article of the code article of the convention the caselaw of the european court of human right the court and on the applicant statement the cdj held that the applicant had overstepped the limit of expression that had to comply with the duty of discretion thus the balance between an individual right to freedom of expression and a democratic state legitimate interest in ensuring that a person holding public office had complied with the scope of article of the convention had been broken the cdj held furthermore that by expressing opinion which could make a reasonable observer that is to say a wellintentioned disinterested and informed person doubt a colleague professional integrity and morality the applicant had overstepped the limit of freedom of expression in relation to that person right to personal image honour and reputation therefore there had been evidence suggesting that the applicant had breached article of the code because in the article under her name she had implied that lds had not performed her professional duty lawfully between and when she had been working a a prosecutor the cdj lastly held that the malicious and distorted presentation of ldss professional activity and the suggestion that her behaviour had been questionable without any supporting evidence in that regard had caused unfounded suspicion to be raised about ldss professionalism the personal opinion expressed by the applicant in her article had amounted to conduct that had affected the right to personal image honour and reputation of the judge conduct proceeding against the applicant decision by the sjcsm in a decision of october the sjcsm held that the applicant article had breached article of the code which set out one of the limitation imposed on an officer of the court right to freedom of expression by relying on similar argument to the one relied on by the cdj see paragraph above the sjcsm held further that the applicant article had been written in a manner that had created a negative image of how judge lds had carried out her duty a a prosecutor during communism the sjcsm dismissed the applicant argument that her article had merely been a literary essay and found that she had overstepped the limit of freedom of expression that had to comply with the duty of discretion thus the balance between her individual right to freedom of expression and a democratic state legitimate interest in ensuring that a person holding public office had complied with the scope of article of the convention had been broken the applicant argument that article of the code could not be read without taking into account the definition of good faith set out in article of law no could not be accepted given that that article defined bad faith and serious negligence and concerned exclusively the exercise of professional function by judge or prosecutor the sjcsm also reiterated the cdjs finding concerning the applicant conduct see paragraph above in addition the sjcsm held that in it decision of march declaring unconstitutional the recently passed legislation on lustration the constitutional court had noted that in their opinion submitted to the court the council of the romanian prosecutor association had stated that in accordance with the relevant law in force during communist time civilian prosecutor had been competent to investigate only ordinary offence not political offence and that prosecutor had not only not served the regime but had been the only obstacle against abuse committed by repressive body in contrast to the abovementioned point the applicant had referred to the case file processed by lds during that time a being used a a mean of oppression in order to root out the enemy of the socialist order and for the pursuit of the new man or to convict woman of abortion without presenting any concrete evidence she wa therefore practically blaming the president of the court of cassation simply because she had worked a a prosecutor during communism thus she had clearly affected the professional and moral integrity of a fellow judge the applicant challenge against the sjcsm decision on december the applicant challenged the decision before the plenary of the csm she argued that article of the code concerned the expression of an opinion but failed to define the concept in the absence of a definition of this concept it could be reasonably argued that it meant expressing a subjective point of view however in order to affect a person image honour and reputation such a personal opinion had had to clearly and expressly concern concrete act and fact capable of compromising the professional integrity or the morality of that person her article had not contained any explicit clear statement concerning the morality and professional integrity of judge lds her essay had contained only several rhetorical question which had not amounted to a categorical opinion also by using the expression comrade prosecutor she had referred to an undeniable fact within the framework of portraying the communist time relying on international and european instrument concerning judge the applicant argued further that those instrument required special diligence in case concerning the disciplinary investigation of judge including a careful selection and assessment of strictly objective and essential element so that any exposure of a judge to unacceptable pressure would be avoided the same requirement had to be complied with in case of a conduct investigation given that pursuant to domestic law an acknowledgement of a breach of the code amounted to a disciplinary sanction which would prevent her career advancement unlike in other european state the romanian code had not been merely a guide on moral issue but a disguised disciplinary code her conduct which had consisted in her publishing a literary article depicting her personal experience had been examined in a deficient manner by breaching the highly important objectivity criterion set out in the relevant international instrument thus some segment and expression from the text had been assessed excessively and had been given subjectively a certain meaning which had been preferred by the investigator also the rule and principle concerning a judge duty of discretion had been misunderstood and had been interpreted very rigidly by relying on argument that had had no connection to the text the fact that the disciplinary proceeding had been diverted into codeofconduct proceeding supported the argument of the pressure imposed of it own motion by an independent body which had not been created to investigate judge the applicant also argued that her essay had concerned the post of president of the court of cassation and had not referred to a colleague because she had not had any interest in lds a a person under the relevant international rule concerning judge a judge had to be more tolerant and open to question and criticism since he or she wa very exposed to the public that wa even more so in case of judge exercising an official state function the person exercising an official state function wa a subject of public interest and therefore it wa natural that all aspect concerning that person past and present career be debated publicly by any person lastly the applicant argued that her essay had been part of a series of other essay that she had already published and had not been a single and isolated work decision by the csms plenary by a decision of january the csms plenary dismissed the applicant challenge it held that the applicant status a an officer of the court had not deprived her of her right to freedom of expression however her conduct consisting of the statement she had made in her article published in the press had breached an officer of the court duty of discretion thus the balance between an individual right to freedom of expression and a democratic state legitimate interest in ensuring that a person holding public office had complied with the scope of article of the convention had been broken an officer of the court duty of discretion implied moderation and restraint in presenting his or her opinion the applicant had been entitled to express her opinion on some aspect concerning the activity of the justice system however the manner of making some of her statement had broken the abovementioned balance especially since there wa no evidence suggesting that under the circumstance the expression used had represented for her the only way of conveying the information she had intended to present by publishing the article by the manner of presenting the event and the expression used the applicant had affected the moral and professional integrity of a fellow judge her statement had not been value judgment but had in fact conveyed certain specific point and had been a clear and unequivocal personal opinion concerning the moral and professional integrity of the president of the court of cassation her argument that her article had concerned exclusively the post of president of the court of cassation had been illfounded the opinion expressed in the article had concerned the person holding that post since a distinction could not be made between the post and the person holding it moreover presenting the reality of communist time could have been done in a le intense manner which would not have affected a colleague professional integrity and honour and with a focus on the problem faced by the justice system the plenary also held that the applicant statement had to be examined in the context of the lack of trust in the justice system that had been apparent for a long time and which had seriously affected it authority and the appearance of impartiality clearly a judge should have known better than anyone the risk of statement which could have a significant impact on the reputation of the system in this context using balanced language with an objective presentation of the system deficiency wa better than making statement breaching professional conduct about a colleague therefore the applicant argument that her essay had not contained a categorical opinion but only literary rhetorical question could not be accepted the manner in which the applicant had chosen to express her opinion about the reality of the communist regime in suggesting that a fellow magistrate had had questionable conduct and professional evolution had resulted in unjustified doubt being raised about the moral and professional integrity of the president of the court of cassation lastly the csms plenary concluded that the personal opinion expressed by the applicant in her article had amounted to conduct that had affected the right to personal image honour and reputation of judge ldsthe applicant appeal against the decision by the csms plenary the applicant appealed against the csms plenarys decision before the court of cassation and reiterated the argument of her challenge of december against the sjcsms decision of october see paragraph above judgment of the court of cassation in a final judgment of november the court of cassation dismissed the applicant appeal a illfounded it held that the applicant article had presented in a distorted way the professional activity of the president of the court of cassation suggesting that she had behaved questionably without presenting supporting evidence the expression used by the applicant such a comrade prosecutor all these comrade usurper of christ and his law and have sternly guarded the communist prison may have caused a reasonable observer that is to say a wellintentioned disinterested and informed person to doubt the moral and professional integrity of the person targeted by the article and clearly overstepped the boundary of the applicant duty of discretion according to the relevant international instrument and the court caselaw the freedom of expression of officer of the court wa exercised mainly under the umbrella of the court caselaw and of the convention both a regard the duty and responsibility incumbent on those who serve justice and a regard the limitation imposed on their right which were necessary to guarantee the authority and impartiality of the justice system a a result the applicant argument that by presenting in an exclusively literary manner her personal life experience she had not tarnished the dignity of the position of judge or the independence and impartiality of the judiciary could not be accepted because the article had contained clear reference to the professional activity and the behaviour of the president of the court of cassation and had made reference to the communist period when she had worked a a prosecutor the court held furthermore that the applicant argument that the disciplinary proceeding had been diverted into conduct proceeding on the motion of an independent body which had not been created to investigate alleged misconduct by judge could also not be accepted the rule and regulation concerning the organisation and function of the csm and it body provided expressly for a procedure concerning the examination of alleged breach of the code which wa different from the procedure set out for the examination of alleged disciplinary offence also the manner in which the decision taken during these separate set of proceeding could be challenged wa different therefore the cdjs decision of may see paragraph above had not represented a diversion of the disciplinary proceeding into codeofconduct proceeding other relevant information other csm and administrative proceeding brought by the applicant on december the applicant asked the csm to remove from her professional file the sjcsms decision of october the csms plenarys decision of january the court of cassations judgment of november and any other information concerning the alleged breach of the code by her in addition she asked the csm to annul it decision to introduce the code she argued that the csms plenarys decision to introduce the code and the code itself had been unconstitutional and therefore any information concerning an alleged breach of the code by her in her professional case file had been unconstitutional on january the csms plenary dismissed the applicant request a illfounded reasoning that there had been no legal ground for removing the document indicated by her from her professional file in addition the decision to introduce the code and the code itself had not been unconstitutional on april the applicant brought administrative proceeding against the csm seeking to have the relevant document and any other information concerning the alleged breach of the code by her removed from her professional file and the csms decision to introduce the code annulled and article of the code struck down in addition she raised an unconstitutionality objection concerning the decision to introduce the code she argued that amongst other thing article of the code wa unlawful because it wa unclear and lacked precision in so far a the person who wa protected by this article wa concerned in particular it wa unclear whether the protection provided by the article in question concerned a colleague who wa working for the same court a the officer of the court under investigation or one who wa working for any other court in the country a finding that an officer of the court had breached the code could have negative consequence on his or her career in so far a professional evaluation and career advancement were concerned on september the piteşti court of appeal the court of appeal referred the applicant unconstitutionality objection concerning the csm decision to introduce the code to the constitutional court the constitutional court proceeding appear to be still pending in a judgment of october which wa amenable to appeal the court of appeal rejected the administrative proceeding brought by the applicant against the csm a illfounded there is no evidence in the file whether this set of proceeding ended in a final judgment information submitted to the court by the party the applicant participation in competition for post at the court of cassation on february the csm asked the ij to produce a report on the professional integrity of the candidate including the applicant who had been declared eligible to participate in a competition organised from january to may for promotion to the court of cassation on

paying for her rent and she had initiated court proceeding against the authority ii the sjcsm had decided to impose a disciplinary penalty on the applicant following a conflict she had had with a colleague in but the decision had not been final at the time of the report iii and that according to the final sjcsm decision of october see paragraph above the applicant had breached article of the code subsequently the ij concluded that the applicant had not met the necessary requirement of conduct duty and integrity to compete for a court of cassation post on january and november the csm informed the government that the applicant had met the lawful condition for participation in the competition see paragraph above but she had failed to attend the actual exam the outcome of the conduct

were calculated a codeofconduct penalty could not result on it own in the officer of the court not being given a very good rating in his or her appraisal report since the csm had examined seven case concerning possible breach of article of the code by judge and prosecutor in two case including the applicant case the sjcsm had found that article of the code had been breached while in the remaining five case it had been decided in final decision that the aforementioned article had not been breached on november the president of the bucharest court of appeal informed the government that the applicant would not be eligible to apply for promotion to the court of cassation until january regardless of the outcome of her appraisal because in the court of cassation had confirmed the disciplinary penalty imposed on the applicant for the event which had taken place in see paragraph above the court of cassations judgment of april in a final judgment of april published in the

case some published picture of s which mostly showed him at a much younger age the public prosecutor office obtained a psychiatric expert opinion in october the expert concluded that s wa suffering from a schizoid personality disorder at the time when he had committed the offence the trial against s began on january at the potsdam regional court photographer working for the applicant company attended the hearing to take still photograph and make videorecordings of the defendant prior to the start of the hearing the presiding judge informed the photojournalist orally that the defendant face would have to be made unidentifiable in the usual manner before any image of him were published according to the applicant company the presiding judge had indicated at the beginning of the hearing on january that anyone who failed to comply with this order no longer needed to show himself at the regional court of potsdam and apply for permission to take photo of future proceeding the applicant company submitted a copy of an email of a journalist who attended the hearing confirming the alleged statement of the presiding judge the government contested the applicant company assertion that the presiding judge had threatened not only to bar journalist from taking photograph during the proceeding against the defendant but also from future proceeding before the potsdam regional court the government submitted that according to the presiding judge no such statement had been made s repeated his confession on the first day of the hearing by a letter of january the second applicant company asked the president of the regional court to change the presiding judge oral order it pointed out inter alia that several unpixelated picture of s had been published in different newspaper before by a letter of the same date the president replied that he had forwarded the letter to the presiding judge for lack of competence on january the presiding judge supplemented his order and provided his reason in writing the only medium representative who were permitted to take photograph and make videorecordings of s were those who had previously registered with the court and given an assurance that prior to the publication or forwarding of the material the face of s would be disguised by a technical process for example by pixelisation so that it would only be possible to use the image in such a form journalist were barred from further reporting on the case if they failed to comply with the order the presiding judge stated in his reason that he had to balance the public interest in being informed and the personality right of s he acknowledged that the crime at issue wa very different from usual crime and that permitting only picture that disguised s impaired the public ability to be informed however he held that the order wa justified in view of the need to protect the personality right of s he reasoned that it wa unlikely that the case had caused a sensation throughout germany no nationwide television channel besides the second applicant had shown any interest in reporting on it he stressed the importance of the presumption of innocence finding that reporting on s in a way which identified him could have a pillory effect consequently according to the presiding judge the personality right of s who had never been in the public eye or sought to contact the medium and who had expressly requested that his identity be concealed outweighed the public interest in being informed furthermore the order had already proved to be necessary a there had been individual violation of the judge instruction following the first day of the hearing on january the presiding judge sent the supplemented written order to a number of journalist including some who worked for the applicant company on january the applicant company filed an objection gegenvorstellung requesting the suspension of the judicial order banning the publication of image enabling

part of the applicant fourth question resulting in the discontinuation of the proceeding in this regard the applicant request for disclosure a presented to the administrative court at the time of it judgment of december read a followsi what incriminating finding are available against the thirteen judge and the public prosecutor who are still serving at presentii what are the name of the thirteen judge where are they currently servingiii what is the name of the public prosecutor where is he currently servingiv which of the thirteen judge concerned are currently dealing with or have previously dealt with proceeding concerning wrongful act committed by the gdr verfahren zur aufarbeitung von ddrunrecht the administrative court dismissed the application for disclosure it reproduced the reasoning of the administrative court of appeal decision of october in it entirety in so far a that court had dismissed the applicant appeal see paragraph above endorsed it and added some consideration a to the balancing exercise it had performed itself a to the first question of the applicant information request the administrative court considered that he wa not entitled to disclosure of the information sought that is to say incriminating finding in respect of the thirteen judge and one public prosecutor who were currently serving in the brandenburg judiciary and for whom there were indication that they had previously collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security firstly while the prerequisite for a request under section of the brandenburg press act see paragraph below were met he could not base a request on that provision because the provision of the stasi record act gesetz über die unterlagen de staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen deutschen demokratischen republik were lex specialis where the disclosure sought concerned record of the state security service of the former gdr first sentence of section and first sentence of section of the stasi record act see paragraph below this conclusion wa confirmed by section of the stasi record act according to which personal information transmitted by the federal commissioner could a a rule only be used for the purpose for which it had been transmitted see paragraph below in the present case this purpose wa assessing whether the individual concerned could be integrated into the brandenburg judiciary there wa no exemption from that rule that would allow disclosure of such information to the press secondly the applicant could not rely on section and of the stasi record act see paragraph below irrespective of whether the requirement of those provision were met a such a request would be directed against the federal commissioner rather than the land of brandenburg thirdly the applicant had failed to prove that he wa entitled to disclosure of the information under the brandenburg information act brandenburgisches akteneinsichts und informationsgesetz see paragraph below or article of the constitution of the land of brandenburg see paragraph below in any event the provision of the stasi record act were also lex specialis in relation to claim under these provision and prevented disclosure fourthly the applicant could not rely on the first sentence of article of the basic law see paragraph below a the right to freedom of information informationsfreiheit only gave a right to obtain information from source that were intended to be generally accessible that wa not the case with regard to the information sought by the applicant in so far a the applicant submitted that the law had changed and file held by the authority were generally accessible following the entry into force of the federal freedom of information act informationsfreiheitsgesetz de bundes the court noted that the scope of the right to freedom of information under the basic law remained unaffected by this development a request based on the federal freedom of information act wa in any event ruled out a the provision of the stasi record act were lex specialis lastly the applicant wa not entitled to disclosure of the requested information based on the freedom of the press guaranteed by the second sentence of article of the basic law which he had not even invoked since the scope of that right did not extend to the opening up of a source of information which wa not generally accessible eröffnung einer informationsquelle a to the first part of the applicant second and third question regarding the name of the judge and public prosecutor the administrative court found that he wa not entitled to disclosure of the requested information either the prerequisite for a request under section of the brandenburg press act were met but the respondent wa entitled to refuse disclosure of the information in accordance with section of that act see paragraph below disclosure of the name would affect the right to protection of personality right allgemeines persönlichkeitsrecht of the individual concerned and their interest outweighed the interest of the applicant a a journalist and the public in disclosure of the name of the judge and public prosecutor for whom there were indication that they had previously collaborated with the ministry of state security of the former gdr despite the significance of the requested disclosure for the work of the press in a democratic society reiterating that there wa no general rule that priority be accorded in the event of a conflict between the aforementioned constitutional right the administrative court considered a regard the interest of the applicant a a journalist and the public in disclosure of the impugned information that a free and independent press wa of particular significance in a democratic society to effectively exercise that role the press had to have in principle unlimited access to information including by obtaining access to source of information that were not generally accessible in order to inform others the medium first had to be informed themselves to that end they needed to have access to the internal working of administration and the process taking place there it wa in general for the press to evaluate and decide what it regarded a being information of public interest making use of the requested information wa the editorial responsibility of the respective medium outlet alone in which context the press could in general be trusted to be aware of it responsibility and to comply with the principle of the press code of conduct and the guideline issued in that regard the mere possibility that a publication would violate personality right wa not sufficient for refusing the disclosure of information to the press it wa evident that there wa a public interest in disclosure of the name of the judge and public prosecutor for whom there were indication that they had previously collaborated with the gdr ministry of state security on the other hand the administrative court considered that disclosure would interfere with the right of the judge and public prosecutor to informational selfdetermination that is to say their authority to themselves decide when and within which boundary fact and circumstance of their personal life were to enter the public domain and would have severe consequence they would be stigmatised their work would be closely watched by the public and there wa a risk that their current and past decision would be subject to public criticism solely because they had previously collaborated with the ministry of state security of the former gdr their reputation could be harmed and they could possibly face hostile behaviour both in their professional and personal life a the matter concerned only fourteen people and the applicant worked a a journalist for a newspaper with a large circulation the potential publication of the individual name could be expected to have a considerable impact moreover even though the individual concerned held particularly important position they had never sought public attention and had kept a low profile since being integrated into the brandenburg judiciary after the reunification of germany the information request did not concern professional conduct in relation to their current function furthermore the potential collaboration with the ministry of state security of the former gdr which the person concerned had not concealed when their application had been assessed had occurred more than twenty year earlier and they had undergone background check by the committee for the selection of judge and public prosecutor these committee had examined application on a casebycase basis assessing the nature and scope of the collaboration with the ministry of state security the severity of the harm that could have been caused the reason for the commencement and discontinuation of the collaboration the age of the person concerned a well a the intended function within the judiciary in accordance with the relevant guideline person whose collaboration with the gdr ministry of state security had exceeded the official duty imposed on them had not been appointed to the brandenburg judiciary whether or not it wa reasonable that an individual be part of public service had been determined based on his or her function within the gdr ministry of state security and his or her conduct after the end of the collaboration in the select case in which judge and public prosecutor had been integrated into the brandenburg judiciary despite indication or evidence of their prior collaboration with the gdr ministry of state security such collaboration had been determined a not to have been so severe that it opposed their integration into the brandenburg judiciary that decision taken by the land of brandenburg more than twenty year earlier placed the land a the employer under an obligation not to disclose their identity at least if there wa no professional misconduct a to the second part of his second and third question regarding where the judge and public prosecutor were serving the administrative court found that the applicant wa not entitled to disclosure of more information than what he had already received it essentially relied on the consideration that depending on where the individual concerned served it wa likely that they would be identified even if the information were disclosed in an anonymised form given the small number of judge and public prosecutor working in certain place this would notably be the case if the public prosecutor were employed at the brandenburg prosecutor general office in view of the information released so far and the wording of the applicant information request the public prosecutor wa male and there were only eight male public prosecutor at that office who could be concerned against this background the applicant wa not entitled to know whether the individual concerned worked at the prosecutor general office or at one of the four public prosecutor office in brandenburg for similar consideration it wa not possible to disclose where the judge concerned were currently serving while ensuring their anonymity if they served at one of the court with a small number of judge it wa likely that they would be identified also bearing in mind additional aspect which could lead to their identification such a their age or whether they had been citizen of the gdr a regard the applicant fourth question a presented to the administrative court at the time of it judgment that is limited to the question of which of the thirteen judge concerned had previously dealt with or were currently dealing with proceeding concerning wrongful act committed by the gdr see paragraph above the administrative court endorsed the reasoning of the administrative court of appeal in it decision of october see paragraph above which had found that this request wa too vague a it wa not possible to determine on which type of proceeding the applicant sought to obtain information the administrative court added that the applicant wa not entitled to receive the requested information under article of the convention either lastly there were no indication that his procedural right including the right to a fair trial had been infringed by the fact that the judge concerned were serving in the brandenburg judiciary contrary to his allegation to that effect on january the applicant lodged a request for leave to appeal by an order of september the berlin brandenburg administrative court of appeal dismissed the applicant request for leave to appeal it rejected his submission expressing doubt a to the correctness of the administrative court judgment which related to the alleged wrongful application of domestic law the court of appeal decision wa served on the applicant counsel on september in his constitutional complaint of october the applicant alleged a violation of his right under the first and second sentence of article of the basic law his right to be heard and article of the convention by an order of december the federal constitutional court declined to accept the applicant constitutional complaint for adjudication no bv r without providing reason the decision wa served on the applicant counsel on december event outside the scope of the proceeding at issue on an undisclosed date the applicant turned to the federal commissioner he requested access to the record held and to be allowed to consult it file documenting the processing of the request by the brandenburg ministry of justice no further information on the outcome of these request wa provided by the party following another query by the applicant the authority of the land of brandenburg provided him with the following information in july since december one judge had dealt with

radio station they referred in particular to msʼs candidacy for that position m wa the entertainment editor at the bd public radio at the material time the relevant part of the letter read a follows we acknowledge and appreciate your support and the effort you put in creating a multiethnic radio unfortunately it appears that there wa a major oversight at the very beginning of this important venture the panel for the selection of the director of the radio wa created in contravention of the statute of brčko district it is composed of three serb member one croat and one bosniac thus yet again the statute which requires proportional representation of the three constituent people in public institution wa disregarded unfortunately nothing ha been done to correct this the unofficial information we received to the effect that m m wa proposed for the position of the radio director by the serb member of the panel although the former director wa bosniac confirms the above this proposal is unacceptable all the more so because it concern a person who lack the professional and moral quality for such a position according to the information we receivedin an interview published in nin discussing the destruction of mosque in brčko m m said that muslim were not people that they did not posse culture and that accordingly destroying mosque could not be seen a a destruction of cultural monument on the radio premise she made a point of removing from the wall and tore to piece the calendar with the schedule of religious service during the month of ramadanon the radio premise she covered the coat of arm of bosnia and herzegovina with the coat of arm of the republika srpskaas the editor of the entertainment programme she banned broadcasting of sevdalinka arguing that that type of song had no cultural or musical value we firmly believe that the abovedescribed act absolutely disqualify m m a a candidate for the position of the director of the multiethnic radio and television of brčko district we hope that you will act accordingly in the absence of any action on your part we will be forced to contact the medium a well a the other competent national and international body shortly thereafter the letter wa published in three different daily newspaper on may m initiated civil defamation proceeding against the applicant and claimed compensation of convertible mark bam m submitted that she had learned about the content of the letter shorlty after it had been sent by the defendant but that she did not know who gave it to the medium after the letter wa published the governor of bd annulled the proceeding for the appointment of a director of the public radio station on september the bd court of first instance the court of first instance rejected the claim it held that the applicant could not be liable for the alleged defamation because they had not published the letter in the medium the relevant part of the judgment read a follows from the defendant letter it is clear that it wa privately sent to the governor to the president of the assembly and to the supervisor for brčko districtand it wa not sent to the medium the aim of the letter wa not dissemination of unverified information to public but bringing the attention of the competent authority to certain issue and to enable them to draw certain conclusion on verification of that information having examined the article published in the medium the court concludes that none of them wa published by the defendant in this case m appealed against that judgment to the bd appellate court the appellate court on may the appellate court quashed the judgment of september and decided to hold a new hearing on july after having examined several witness including the two employee of the bd public radio from whom the applicant received the information presented in their letter the appellate court found that the contested letter contained some valuejudgments but also the statement of fact which had been untrue and damaging to msʼs reputation it held that for the liability for defamation to be established under section of the defamation act it wa irrelevant that the applicant did not publish the letter the appellate court ordered the applicant to inform the international supervisor for bd the president of the assembly of bd and the bd governor about the retraction of their statement within day in default of which they had to pay bam in damage to m together with default interest at the statutory rate from july they were further ordered to publish the judgment at their own expense on november m filed a request for the enforcement of the above judgment to the court of first instance she proposed inter alia that the court send the judgment of july for publication at the applicant expense on december the court of first instance issued a writ of execution on december the applicant paid bam approximately euro eur by way of the enforcement of the judgment of july on march the court of first instance closed the enforcement proceeding in the meantime on october the applicant complained about the violation of their right to freedom of expression to the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina the constitutional court on may the constitutional court held that the interference with the applicant right to freedom of expression wa necessary in a democratic society and concluded that there had been no violation of article iih of the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina and article of the convention the relevant part of the decision read a follows at the outset the constitutional court note that the appellant did not deny that their liability for defamation wa based on the defamation act and that therefore the interference with the right to freedom of expression protected by article of the european convention wa prescribed by law the impugned judgment wa delievered in a civil defamation proceeding initiated by the plaintiff against the appellantsaccordingly the interference pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation or right of others what remains to be determined is whether the interference complained of wa necessary in a democratic society the constitutional court considers that the appellate court established without doubt that the impugned factual statement about m were false and that the appellant were liable for defamation from the submission of the two witness from whom the appellant received the information presented in the letter concerning the part of the letter in which it wa stated that m made a point of removing from the wall and tore to piece the calendar with the schedule of religious service during the month of ramadan and a the editor of the entertainment programme she banned broadcasting of sevdalinka arguing that that type of song had no cultural or musical value the appellate court established that there wa an evident inconsistency between that what had been said to the appellant and that what they had reported in the letter furthermore the statement from the impugned letter that m gave an interview concerning the destruction of mosque wa refuted by another witness who submitted that a subsequent verification had revealed that m had not been the author of the said interview finally the appellant failed to prove the veracity of the allegation that m covered the coat of arm of bosnia and herzegovina with the coat of arm of the republika srpska in view of the above the constitutional court considers that in the present case the right of the appellant to report irregularity in the conduct of an official to a body competent to deal with such complaint can not be premised on ascertaining manifestly untrue fact which go beyond the limit of acceptable criticism of civil servant accordingly the court considers that the appellate court correctly concluded that there wa a pressing social need in the present case for the interference with the appellant right to freedom of expression furthermore the constitutional court note that the appellate court awarded nonpecuniary damage to m because her reputation wa affected by the untrue statement made in the impugned letter the constitutional court ha already stated in it previous jurisprudence that a person reputation form part of her personal identity and psychological integrity the appellantsfailed to verify the impugned statement beforehand a wa their duty the appeal court established that the appellant had damaged ms reputation by making untrue allegation which caused her mental anguish when deciding on the claim in respect of nonpecuniary damage and it amount the appellate court took into account the purpose of those damage a well a that it should not favour aspiration that are incompatible with it nature and social purpose the constitutional court considers that a measure imposed on the appellant in the present case wa proportionate to the aim pursued the court further considers that the appellate court did not go beyond it discretionary power in deciding on the claim in respect of nonpecuniary damage the constitutional court find that the reason the appellate court gave were relevant and sufficient within the meaning of article of the european convention in view of the above the constitutional court considers that the interference with the appellant right to freedom of expression wa necessary in a democratic society and that therefore there ha been no violation of article iih of the constitution of bosnia and herzegovina and article of the european convention on september the constitutional court decision wa served on the applicant ii relevant domestic lawa constitution of bosnia and herzegovina the constitution of bosnia and

the s the impugned statement that he wa a convicted neo nazi wa undisputedly true it furthermore submitted that the plaintiff wa one of the most important former austrian neo nazi and that the circumstance that had led to his conviction were of historical importance zeitgeschichtlich bedeutend thus the plaintiff wa an absolute person of contemporary history absolute person der zeitgeschichte furthermore he had not ceased his respective political activity after his release from prison but wa still active in the neo nazi scene by way of proving that statement the applicant company quoted a wikipedia entry about h a well a an article by the documentation archive of the austrian resistance dokumentationsarchiv de oesterreichischen widerstandes according to which the plaintiff h had attended two public event with gk in namely an event in carinthia organised by the freedom party of austria and an event in leipzig organized by die freien kräfte leipzig where both h and gk had allegedly given speech on the prohibition act there wa a public interest in knowing about the political circle in which nh a presidential candidate moved and the impugned report had broached the issue of how the freedom party of austria dealt with rightwing extremism it wa therefore covered by article of the convention h disputed the allegation that he had engaged in any activity in the neo nazi scene after his conviction he argued that the event in carinthia in had served the purpose of commemorating war veteran and had been attended by several member of different political party a regard the event in leipzig in the same year he denied that he had made the comment that had been mentioned in the article quoted by the applicant company he had only expressed his personal experience at an event organised by the national democratic party of germany nationaldemokratische partei deutschland or npd a recognised political party by a decision of august the vienna commercial court handelsgericht wien in provisional proceeding provisorialverfahren dismissed hs application for the issuance of an interim injunction the court essentially argued that the public interest in receiving information on nh circle including his staff member and the interest of the applicant company in publication outweighed the interest of h in the observance of confidentiality moreover the assertion made in the article in respect of h namely that he wa a convicted neo nazi wa true by a decision of september the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht wien dismissed an appeal lodged by h essentially endorsing the reasoning of the lower court however following a further appeal by h the supreme court oberster gerichtshof in a decision of january case no ob g prohibited the applicant company from publishing picture of h without his consent if at the same time he is called a convicted neo nazi in the accompanying report andor statement of equivalent meaning are made about him there and gave the following reasoning the supreme court ha already approved in case no ob s see paragraph below in respect of another company which is also a part of the defendant medium company the prohibition of the publication of the plaintiff hs image without his consent if the accompanying text describes him a a neo nazi leader and doe not state at the same time that he ha already served his prison sentence and ha behaved well since in the case at hand the defendant published an article in it periodical publication österreich on july in which the claimant h is referred to a a convicted neo nazi a photograph accompanying this article show the claimant next to the convicted gk among other person this court can not uphold the lowerinstance judgment holding that decision no ob s had been complied with despite the fact that the plaintiff wa described in the article a a convicted neo nazi but at the same time in the accompanying text it wa stated that the neo nazi meeting depicted in the picture had taken place in the supreme court ha clarified that any balancing of interest performed when assessing the legality of photojournalistic coverage concerning a convicted person after his or her release on parole must consider among other thing the connection between the content of the report in question and the accompanying picture a well a the completeness and correctness of the accompanying text decision no ob t the content of the article impugned in this case however are not concerned with the claimant but with his brother and with a candidate for the election of the federal president therefore there wa no objective justification at all for the reference to the previous conviction of the claimant a a neo nazi subsequently in the main proceeding the vienna commercial court by judgment of april ordered the applicant company to refrain from now on from publishing picture of h without his consent if at the same time he is called a convicted neo nazi in the accompanying report andor statement of equivalent meaning are made about him therein at the same time it dismissed the claim lodged by h for euro eur plus interest and cost by way of compensation for nonpecuniary damage and ordered the applicant company to reimburse h for the cost of the proceeding in it reasoning the court essentially noted referring to the reasoning of the supreme court in the provisional proceeding see paragraph above that a balancing of the clearly infringed interest of the claimant against the public interest in the publication that gave rise to the instant proceeding apparently doe not have to be carried out the claim lodged by h for compensation for nonpecuniary damage had to be dismissed given the fact that a particular injury that is to say an injury exceeding the usual measure über da übliche maß hinausgehende kränkung could not have occurred for the very reason that the fact in question are indisputably true the vienna court of appeal did not grant the related appeal lodged by the applicant company dismissing it by a judgment of september it essentially stated that according to the legal view held by the supreme court there had been no objective justification for the reference to the conviction of the claimant a a neo nazi in the impugned article because the content of the article had not concerned the claimant but his brother and a candidate in the election for the federal president therefore it wa unnecessary to balance the individual interest of the claimant against the public interest in being informed about the political environment in which the office manager of the presidential candidate moved it ordered the applicant company to reimburse h for the cost of the proceeding by a decision of december case no ob s the supreme court rejected an extraordinary appeal on point of law lodged by the applicant company it referred to it reasoning in the provisional proceeding see paragraph above and added citing the case of österreichischer rundfunk v austria no december that there wa no temporal connection between the photograph taken in hs criminal conviction in and the applicant company calling him a convicted neo nazi in the impugned article of relevant domestic legal framework and practice section of the copyright act urheberrechtsgesetz prohibits any public exhibition andor dissemination of image where the legitimate interest of the person in question would be violated it read a follows in it relevant part protection of one image section image of person shall neither be exhibited publicly nor disseminated in any other manner by which they are made accessible to the public where the legitimate interest of the person in question or in the event that they have died without having authorised or ordered publication of a close relative would be injured in assessing whether legitimate interest are violated not only the picture alone ha to be considered but also the accompanying text in it overall context see supreme court case no ob t and no ob w in it decision of october case no ob s see paragraph above regarding a different article published by the applicant company that had contained a photograph of h with the accompanying caption neo nazi leader the supreme court held that the picture a such wa connected with event of contemporary historical significance however the publication of photograph that together with the accompanying text recalled crime committed long ago by the person depicted would generally disproportionately impair his or her advancement owing to the pillorying effect prangerwirkung that would arise therefrom according to the supreme court this applied all the more if the person concerned in the instant case h in had already served his or her prison sentence and had been socially reintegrated for year and for those reason had a legitimate interest in the public not being reminded of his or her past the supreme court found that the lower court had taken into account the public interest in the publication of the photograph a they had not generally prohibited it a legitimate interest in such publication could not however justify creating the incorrect impression that h who had been fully rehabilitated and wa not any longer in the public eye wa still active a a neo nazi leader starting with it judgment of september case no ob the supreme court ha consistently held that section of the copyright act ha to be interpreted in the light of section a of the medium act mediengesetz this provision specifies in which case the publication of image of victim suspect or offender is to be permitted by giving detail of the criterion for the balancing of interest to be performed accordingly the austrian court have to ass by way of a first step whether there is a public interest in publication and which legitimate interest of the person concerned run counter to publication subsequently the legitimate interest of the person concerned must be balanced against the public interest if any in the publication of that person image publication is permitted only if the public interest in publication is the overriding interest such overriding public interest in publication may exist for instance on account of the person position in society or of some other connection of that person with public life section a of the medium act provides that the legitimate interest of the person concerned will in any event be harmed if the publication of an article or photograph may disproportionately prejudice the advancement of the

58,the applicant is a registered association which ha it seat in vienna it aim is to research and study past and present transfer of ownership of agricultural and forest land in order to reach conclusion a to the impact of such transfer on society the applicant association also give opinion on draft law falling within it field of interest in essence agricultural and forest land transaction require approval by local and regional authority the latter are called regional real property transaction commission landes grundverkehrskommissionen the aim of this requirement laid down in the real property transaction act of the länder is to preserve land for agricultural use and forestry and in some of the region including tyrol to avoid the proliferation of second home the applicant association state that it is sent all decision issued by the regional real property transaction commission with the exception of the one for tyrol in the decision it receives the name of party and other sensitive data are usually anonymised on april the association asked the tyrol real property transaction commission the commission to provide by mail all decision issued since january in anonymised form the cost thereof to be reimbursed by letter of july the commission replied that it could not comply with the request owing to lack of time and personnel on july the applicant association submitted a further request this time requesting the provision by mail of all decision issued since january in anonymised form in the event of refusal of the application it demanded a formal decision in accordance with the tyrol access to information act tiroler auskunftspflichtgesetz the information act the applicant association argued that since the commission decision concerned civil right within the meaning of article of the convention the decision should be either publicly announced or made public by other appropriate mean in it decision of october the commission rejected the request holding that the transmission of anonymised copy of it decision did not constitute information within the meaning of section of the information act which defines information a existing knowledge on matter known to the authority at the time it provides the information moreover even if the request were to fall within the scope of that provision the information act stated that pursuant to section subparagraph c there wa no duty to provide the information if doing so would require so many resource that the functioning of the authority would be affected the decision stated that complaint could be lodged with the constitutional court verfassungsgerichtshof and the administrative court verwaltungsgerichtshof the applicant association complained to both the constitutional court and the administrative court it relied on article of the convention in it submission in reply to the applicant association complaint to the constitutional court and the administrative court the commission maintained that it decision did not constitute information within the meaning of the information act it argued that a decision contained the fact of the case and the legal conclusion the authority had drawn from them legal argument could be discussed and decision could be challenged and set aside if the legal conclusion were found to be wrong therefore giving someone access to a decision wa comparable to giving someone legal advice a opposed to providing information a defined in the information act on september the administrative court declared that it did not have jurisdiction to deal with the case and rejected the applicant association complaint the administrative court held that it wa only competent to deal with complaint against decision regarding transfer of building plot and not with complaint brought against the commission decision on transfer of agricultural or forest land a the applicant association had not claimed to have been party to the transfer of a building plot it could not base it complaint on that status neither did the information act contain any rule stating that complaint about decision by the commission pursuant to the information act were to be lodged with the administrative court therefore the matter wa excluded from the administrative court jurisdiction consequently the statement in the commission decision that a complaint could be lodged with the administrative court wa not correct on february the constitutional court declined to deal with the case for lack of prospect of success from the perspective of constitutional law and also because the matter wa not excluded from the administrative court jurisdiction the decision wa served on the association representative on april after the government had been notified of the present application the applicant association relying on the government argument in respect of exhaustion of domestic remedy see paragraph below lodged an application under article of the federal constitution seeking a ruling from the constitutional court on the negative conflict of jurisdiction between it and the administrative court on december the constitutional court issued a decision stating that it wa competent to rule on the applicant association complaint against the commission decision of october consequently it set aside it own decision of february and awarded the applicant association reimbursement of the cost of the proceeding in a further decision of december the constitutional court ruled on the merit of the applicant association complaint referring to the court caselaw and it own caselaw it held in particular that whilst the right to receive information enshrined in article of the convention prohibited state from restricting the receipt of information that others wished to or might be willing to impart it did not by contrast impose a positive obligation on state to collect and disseminate information of their own motion the constitutional court added that in accordance with it established caselaw article did not require the state to grant access to information or to make information available of it own motion consequently the commission refusal to transmit anonymised copy of all decision issued during a specific period of time to the applicant association did not constitute an interference with the latter right under article of the convention a to the applicant association argument that the commission decision wa arbitrary a it had failed to provide reason the constitutional court referred to the explanatory report on the information act and endorsed the commission view that the applicant association request wa not merely a question of obtaining information about one or more specific issue but would require the commission to compile of it own motion all decision issued over a period of some year to anonymise them and to send paper copy thereof to the applicant association the commission had therefore rightly taken the view that the applicant association request did not fall within the scope of section of the information act moreover the commission had also dealt with the merit of the request in that it had concluded that the provision of information could be refused pursuant to section subparagraph c of the information act a it would require investigation calculation or preparation considerably impinging on the fulfilment of it other task lastly the constitutional court observed that the applicant association could be implicitly relying also on article of the convention it noted that neither the court caselaw in respect of public access to court decision nor it own caselaw guaranteed the right to obtain anonymised copy of all decision issued by the commission over a lengthy period according to the constitutional court caselaw access had to be given to the judgment delivered by the highest court which dealt with case raising important legal issue however this did not apply to all the commission decision ii relevant domestic law and practicea the information act the information act regional law gazette regulates the duty of the authority to provide information section provides a follows the authority of the land municipality municipal association and any other selfgoverning body regulated by regional law are under an obligation to provide anyone with information about their sphere of competence unless provided otherwise in section information is the notification of existing knowledge on matter known to the authority at the time it provides the information section in so far a relevant provides a follows anyone may require authority of the land municipality municipal association and any other selfgoverning body regulated by regional law to provide information orally in writing or by phone telex or telegraph section in so far a relevant provides a follows no information shall be provided if the provision of such information is contradictory to a statutory duty of confidentiality there is no duty to provide information ifc the provision of information would require investigation calculation or preparation considerably impinging on the proper fulfilment of the authority other task b the tyrol real property transaction act the aim of the tyrol real property transaction act a in force at the material time regional law gazette a amended by regional law gazette wa to preserve land for agricultural and forestry use and to avoid the proliferation of second home contract concerning the transfer of ownership and certain other right relating to agricultural or forest land therefore required approval by local real property transaction authority appeal against their decision could be lodged with the commission either by the party if they considered the decision had violated their right or by the regional real property transaction referee grundverkehrsreferent if he considered that the decision ran contrary to the public interest a complaint could be lodged with the constitutional court against decision of the commission relating to the transfer of agricultural and forest land if approval wa declined the transfer of land wa null and void the regional real property transaction commission wa composed of nine member and substitute member who were appointed for five year and were not bound in the exercise of their function by any instruction a a rule the commission held oral hearing in public an annual report on the situation of real property transfer in tyrol published by the regional government includes a report containing general information on the commission activity it can be seen from these report that in the period from to between and appeal per year were lodged with the

read in the course of our mm survey i would like to ask you the following question would you buy a car from this man would you stake your money on a promise made by this man doe this man have the

these question with no please ask yourself why you want to leave this man in his current position we being entrepreneur will decide at the next tourism association meeting with our vote it is our promise our money our qualification our association and our heritage l a journalist working for the applicant company newspaper wa informed of the anonymous letter he telephoned cm and jm who commented on it claiming it to be part of a political campaign against them a few minute later cm telephoned the journalist back and asked him whether he wa planning to publish the letter when l confirmed that he wa cm said that he did not agree to it publication and that he would take legal action if it were published in the january issue of the bezirksblatt the applicant company published an article entitled anonymous campaign against mm the subheading read mm or cm and jms full surname are the target of a not at all bittersweet campaign the article contained the story of the anonymous letter and cm and jms reply to the accusation made in it it reported that both of them had stated that the letter had attempted to harm their political activity and had considered the accusation to be a personal insult the article contained photo of cm and jm and a reproduction of the letter containing the question set out above relying on section of the medium act cm and jm brought proceeding against the applicant company for defamation requesting compensation and publication of the judgment the applicant company argued that it conduct did not amount to defamation a the article had only quoted someone el statement and had duly distanced itself from the content of the letter moreover the information had been a matter of public interest on march the innsbruck regional court found in favour of the claimant and ordered the applicant company to publish the judgment and to pay eur in compensation to each of them the regional court held that the article itself merely commented on the letter in an objective manner and did not agree with it offensive content furthermore the nature of the office held by the claimant meant that they were often in the local medium but had so far not been the subject of any negative campaign however the anonymous letter which had been included in the article fulfilled the actus reus of defamation a it accused cm and jm of dishonesty and other disreputable character trait relating to both their professional and private life both had experienced negative repercussion a a result of the article in their professional activity a lawyer in that they had repeatedly been confronted with the allegation made in the anonymous letter the regional court referring to the applicant company argument that it had only quoted a statement made by someone else noted that section of the medium act only permitted quoting the statement of a third person if the quotation wa truthful and there wa an overriding public interest in it publication this rule would even apply if the identity of the third person having made the statement wa unknown in any case the court held that it wa required to balance the public interest in disseminating information about the statement quoted against the claimant interest in protecting their reputation it accepted that the local public had an interest in knowing about a campaign against the chairman of the tourism association and a local politician however public interest did not justify reproduction of the anonymous letter in the article the applicant company could have provided information on the campaign against cm and jm without printing the defamatory letter in that connection the court observed that by printing the letter the applicant had also made it entire content known to a far greater number of people than the letter itself had reached the applicant company appealed and lodged a plea of nullity relying on the medium act in particular on the socalled law on quotation developed under section of that act it asserted that the regional court had wrongly considered there to be no overriding public interest in publishing the anonymous letter in particular the article and the letter related to the tourism association which wa a public law corporation and the applicant were both public figure in local politics the innsbruck court of appeal dismissed the appeal on august it held that the law on quotation wa not applicable in the present case it wa not possible to claim for damage under article of the medium act in respect of quotation in the medium where the identity of the third person making the offensive statement wa known in such case the person concerned could seek compensation from the person who had made the offensive statement in the first place a in the present case the person who had made the offensive statement had remained anonymous the applicant company could not rely on section of the medium act furthermore the court of appeal confirming the regional court view found that in any event there wa no overriding public interest in publication of the anonymous letter the judgment wa served on the applicant counsel on january ii relevant domestic law and practice section of the medium act provides for the strict liability of the publisher in case of defamation the victim can thus claim damage from the publisher section in so far a material read a follows where a medium publishes statement which constitute the actus reus of disparagement insult derision or defamation the victim shall have a claim against the owner of the medium publisher for damage for the injury suffered the right referred to in paragraph above shall not apply in the case of defamationa where the statement published are true orb where there wa an overriding public

that the applicant had failed to establish any breach of article he accepted the prosecution submission that the mo u had been drafted with the essence of article in mind and that disclosure had been justified under article he further noted that journalistic privilege did not preclude a newspaper from voluntarily disclosing the identity of a source submission of no case to answer at the close of the prosecution case the applicant sought a ruling from the judge that there wa no case to answer on the basis that the four essential element of the offence had not been made out see paragraph below on may the judge refused the application he found that in respect of each element of the offence there wa evidence on which it would be open to a jury to be sure that this element wa made out he considered that the fact that the applicant had chosen to have cheque for the first twentyseven transaction made out to his son who transferred the equivalent amount into the applicant bank account wa capable of giving rise to the inference that the applicant knew very well that what he wa doing wa wrong and in breach of duty a to whether the applicant had a reasonable excuse or justification for his action the judge found it open to the jury to conclude that he did not having regard to the number of story involved the length of time over which information wa divulged the amount of money involved and the fact that the applicant had not taken up any matter which featured in the story through official channel despite his claim to have been concerned for reason of public interest in respect of the seriousness test the judge took the view that a jury could conclude that the necessary harm to the public interest had been established by the very fact of a prison officer having been in a longstanding relationship with a journalist and in breach of his duty repeatedly divulging information about the prison for money conviction and sentence on june the applicant wa convicted by the jury the following day he wa sentenced to twenty month imprisonment in his sentencing remark the judge accepted that the applicant had had genuine concern about the manner in which the prison wa being run this he considered had been in part a motivating factor for his action the judge continued that said in my judgment that doe not tell the whole story on a number of occasion a you yourself conceded in evidence you disclosed information when the public interest had nothing at all to do with what you were imparting the judge considered that the applicant had been motivated by money and by an intense dislike of the prison governor he further pointed out that the applicant had been a tradeunion representative and could have used official channel to disseminate information had public interest been his sole concern a to the harm caused by his action the judge referred to the suspicion that had fallen on other innocent member of staff since the identity of the person leaking story wa unknown he also highlighted the damage to prisoner who had been demonised in the tabloid story a well a the resulting potential for enmity from other inmate and inmate general mistrust of prison staff because of the leak finally the fact that for a lengthy period of time and on numerous occasion the applicant had acted in flagrant breach of rule which the judge wa satisfied he knew very well prohibited such contact with the press represented a very serious breach of trust in sentencing him to a term of imprisonment the judge emphasised the scope and scale of the offending in the case the court of appeal the applicant sought leave to appeal against conviction and sentence his application for leave to appeal against sentence wa refused on september on september he wa granted leave to appeal his conviction in his written argument prior to the appeal hearing he advanced two ground of appeal first he argued that the trial judge had erred in failing to stay the prosecution a an abuse of process see paragraph above disclosure of his name a a journalistic source had breached article because mgn had been acting under pressure and because the disclosure process had not been prescribed by law a it had lacked the necessary safeguard second he argued that the judge should have acceded to his submission of no case to answer see paragraph above he contended that his misconduct did not meet the criminal threshold but amounted rather to a disciplinary offence and the appropriate article compliant sanction would therefore have been disciplinary proceeding not a criminal prosecution he added that the criminal prosecution of a disciplinary offence offended the principle of legal certainty and thus violated article of the convention on october the court of appeal dismissed the appeal in it judgment it listed the story for which the applicant information wa said to have been the source which it noted ranged from general story in which individual generally remained anonymous to specific or personal story in which prisoner or staff were named or identifiable the court noted at the outset that all of the caselaw of the european court of human right cited in argument wa concerned with the compulsory disclosure of journalistic source or material it found no evidential basis for the applicant suggestion that the police had exerted any improper pressure on mgn to disclose information in particular the comment of the trial judge regarding the newspaper hope that their assistance would avoid prosecution at a higher level see paragraph above merely recorded the motivation of the newspaper it did not amount to a finding that the police had sought to impose any pressure on them indeed the court said all the evidence suggested the reverse it explained the police made no threat or promise express or implied about the bringing of a prosecution against the company or company or their top management the police were seeking voluntary disclosure under the term of the mo u clause of which made clear that mgn retained the right to invoke article ground for refusing disclosure mgn wa a large organisation with access to inhouse and external legal advice it wa inconceivable that mgn did not give careful consideration to whether to make disclosure to the police in the context of the publicity which operation elveden and the leveson inquiry were attracting the police were entitled to assume that the disclosure which wa proffered wa a a result of a considered and informed decision with the benefit of full and accurate legal advice the court concluded that the disclosure had not been procured by any improper pressure or coercion but had been truly voluntary there had therefore been no misconduct by the police in receiving or acting upon the information the court further rejected the argument that voluntary disclosure wa a breach of the applicant article right a a journalistic source to have his anonymity maintained it considered that there wa room for doubt whether the applicant article right were engaged at all in these circumstance referring to council of europe recommendation see paragraph below it noted that while the right of journalist to withhold journalistic material wa an important article right there wa no concomitant obligation on journalist to do so the court also noted that the edition of the editor code of practice described a journalist obligation to protect confidential source of information a a moral obligation see paragraph below in the event the court did not find it necessary to decide the point since even if such a right existed it wa not unqualified assuming in the applicant favour that article wa engaged the court wa satisfied that the use of the material in his prosecution in the circumstance of his case wa compatible with article the freedom of expression which potentially fell within article wa the provision of information in return for the corrupt acceptance of money by him a a public official over a prolonged period which amounted to the serious criminal offence of misconduct in public office revelation of the applicant wrongdoing wa necessary and proportionate for the important public interest of prosecuting a crime which existed in this context to maintain the integrity and efficacy of the prison service and the public confidence in it the court then turned to examine the second ground of appeal that the trial judge should have acceded to his nocasetoanswer submission it observed that while the challenge before the trial court had been that the prosecution case had been insufficient to be left to the jury in respect of all four element of the offence see paragraph above on appeal the argument had been confined to the second and third element see paragraph below only a to the seriousness test the third element the court agreed with the finding of the trial judge see paragraph above it considered that the prosecution evidence wa capable of meeting the high threshold of criminality because of the harm to the public interest caused by the applicant conduct in this respect the court referred to the extent of the applicant corrupt activity taking payment of over gbp for a period of some five year wa conduct that the jury had been entitled to conclude wa not justified in the public interest it wa also conduct that caused significant public harm because corruption of a prison officer on this scale undermined public confidence in the prison service the court further referred to the impact of the leak from an unknown source on trust and morale among and between prisoner and staff and the deterrent effect on staff and prisoner reporting incident a regard the second element of the test the applicant argument wa that what he had done had been in accordance with the freedom of expression protected by article and it could not therefore amount to a breach of duty the court disposed of this argument on the basis that the applicant conduct amounting to the serious offence of misconduct in public office wa not protected by article lastly the court dealt briefly with the article point see paragraph in fine above which it noted had not been pursued in oral argument it concluded that there wa no lack of certainty in the seriousness element of the offence of misconduct in public office it had recently been clearly articulated and explained in attorney general reference no of and r v chapman and others see paragraph below in the latter case it had been made clear that the level of seriousness which had to be reached wa defined by recognised criterion on which the jury were to be directed the seriousness test wa therefore sufficiently clear to enable a person with appropriate legal advice if necessary to regulate his behaviour and foresee whether such behaviour wa capable of amounting to misconduct in public office the supreme court the applicant applied for leave to appeal to the supreme court relying on article and of the convention on january the court of appeal refused to certify a point of law of general public importance and refused leave to appeal relevant legal framework and practicedomestic law and practicemisconduct in public office the element of the offence misconduct in public office is a commonlaw offence not defined in statute it carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment the leading modern case defining the offence is attorney general reference no of ewca crim in which the court of appeal at paragraph stated that the element of the offence were a public officer acting a such wilfully neglect to perform his duty andor wilfully misconduct himself to such a degree a to amount to an abuse of the public trust in the office holder without reasonable excuse or justification a regard the seriousness test the court explained the threshold is a high one requiring conduct so far below acceptable standard a to amount to an abuse of the public trust in the office holder a mistake even a serious one will not suffice the motive with which a public officer act may be relevant to the decision whether the public trust is abused by the conduct the element of culpability must be of such a degree that the misconduct impugned is calculated to injure the public interest so a to call for condemnation and punishment it will normally be necessary to consider the likely consequence of the breach in deciding whether the conduct fall so far below the standard of conduct to be expected of the officer a to constitute the offence the conduct can not be considered in a vacuum the consequence likely to follow from it will often influence the decision a to whether the conduct amounted to an abuse of the public trust in the officer a default where the consequence are likely to be trivial may not posse the criminal quality required a similar default where the damage to the public or member of the public is likely to be great may do so the consequence of some conduct such a corrupt conduct may be obvious the likely consequence of other conduct of public officer will be le clear but it is impossible to gauge the seriousness of the defaulting conduct without considering the circumstance in which the conduct occurs and it likely consequence in the light of operation elveden and the resulting criminal investigation the director of public prosecution issued cps guideline for prosecutor on assessing the public interest in case affecting the medium on september the guidance specifically referred to article of the convention and emphasised that prosecutor were required to take the right to freedom of expression including the right to receive and impart information into account when taking decision on whether to prosecute in march the court of appeal considered the ambit of the offence in the case of r v chapman and others ewca crim where one of the issue before the court wa whether the trial judge direction concerning the threshold of seriousness had been correct the court referred to attorney general reference no of see paragraph above and noted that it had not been suggested that this formulation of the law wa in any way inaccurate it considered that there were two way in which the jury might be assisted to ass seriousness the first wa to refer them to the need for them to reach a judgment that the misconduct wa worthy of condemnation and punishment the second wa to refer them to the requirement that the misconduct had to be judged by them a having had the effect of harming the public interest on the latter the court went on to explain in our view in the context of provision of information to the medium and thus the public that is the way in which the jury should judge the seriousness of the misconduct in determining whether it amount to an abuse of the public trust in the office holder the jury must in our view judge the misconduct by considering objectively whether the provision of the information by the office holder in deliberate breach of his duty had the effect of harming the public interest if it did not then although there may have been a breach or indeed an abuse of trust by the office holder visàvis his employer or commanding officer there wa no abuse of the public trust in the office holder a the misconduct had not had the effect of harming the public interest no criminal offence would have been committed in the context of a case involving the medium and the ability to report information provided in breach of duty and in breach of trust by a public officer the harm to the public interest is in our view the major determinant in establishing whether the conduct can amount to an abuse of the public trust and thus a criminal offence for example the public interest can be sufficiently harmed if either the information disclosed itself damage the public interest a may be the case in a leak of budget information or the manner in which the information is provided or obtained damage the public interest a may be the case if the public office holder is paid to provide the information in breach of duty the law commission project the law commission wa set up for the purpose of promoting the reform of the law in it began a project on the offence of misconduct in public office it reform objective were to decide whether the offence of misconduct in public office should be abolished retained restated or amended it published an issue paper on january launching the first phase of the consultation process appendix c to the paper is entitled misconduct in public office and the echr it identified the definition of the seriousness test a being one of the main difficulty from the perspective of article of the convention the paper continued c this question wa the main focus of the recent court of appeal decision in chapman here the seriousness test wa compared to the test in gross negligence manslaughter which also ha difficulty in term of circularity and uncertainty the court felt that it is not helpful for a jury to be told that the breach of duty must be so serious a to amount to a criminal act and sought to solve this difficulty by applying another method of determining whether the conduct wa so serious it held that the jury must be referred to the requirement that the misconduct must be judged by them a having the effect of harming the public interest unfortunately the concept of public interest is not one with consensus a to it meaning and therefore may not be a much clearer basis for the test the law commission concluded in so far a relevant that the seriousness test wa illdefined and vague and that since it wa a core element of the offence the law might be incompatible with article of the convention paragraph c in the second phase of the consultation process the law commission published consultation paper no of september reforming misconduct in public office and invited response it explained that in the light of the response received it intended to decide on it final recommendation and present them to government at paragraph of the paper the law commission noted that numerous problem had been identified including an abuse of the public trust is crucial in acting a a threshold element of the offence but is so vague that it is difficult for investigator prosecutor and jury to apply the paper continued paragraph the lord chief justice lord thomas reiterated recently in the case of chapman that the legal position is that an abuse of the public trust is one that ha the effect of harming the public interest however it remains unclear what role if any factor such a consequence and impropriety of motive will play in the assessment of harm to the public interest we consider that the difficulty currently experienced with the definition of seriousness in the offence are unlikely to be resolved by the court without a more fundamental review of this element of the offence there are two problem with this element first the jury is being asked to make a circular assessment of whether an individual breach of duty is serious enough to be criminal it is criminal because it is serious it is serious because it is criminal secondly this may be compounded by the fact the jury is being asked to do so without any clear indication of what could amount to serious and therefore criminal misconduct the lack of comprehensive guidance a to what make misconduct serious cause difficulty for investigator prosecutor judge and jury it is particularly difficult in term of making decision a to where the line should be drawn between disciplinary and criminal proceeding the law commission final report and recommendation were published on december in it report it repeated it concern a to the difficulty a jury may have in applying the seriousness criterion overall a regard the commonlaw offence it concluded in summary we consider the following to be the main concern it is not clear in all case whether a person might be subject to the offence a the category of public office is not defined with sufficient precision this creates problem in practice including erroneous charging decision and successful appeal and may offend article of the european convention on human right the fault element that must be proved appears to vary depending on the circumstance of the case creating additional complexity and leading to costly appeal the seriousness threshold that the offence amount to an abuse of the public trust is highly subjective and difficult to apply this ha led to concern that the offence is being pursued in some circumstance that are not sufficiently blameworthy so a to justify criminal consequence there is a general lack of definition in the scope and subject matter of the offence which ha led to it application in contentious context the law commission accordingly recommended the abolition of the commonlaw offence and it replacement with two statutory offence corruption in public office and breach of duty in public office duty related to employment in the prison service rule of the prison rule provides no officer shall make directly or indirectly any unauthorised communication to a representative of the press or any other person concerning matter which have become known to him in the course of his duty article of the civil service code provides civil servant must not misuse

serviceman in the meantime the applicant also lodged a complaint with the ombudsman challenging his discharge from the army on november the ombudsman refused to examine the complaint on the ground that an identical complaint wa being examined by the administrative court and the law did not allow the ombudsman to deal with such complaint on november the applicant appealed to the supreme administrative court reiterating his argument of unlawful dismissal and discrimination his appeal statement indicates that he reiterated his request that his superior in the grand duke vaidotas battalion be ordered to produce certain document from the military service record of the four serviceman mentioned above who he stated had continued serving in the same unit a the applicant despite having reached retirement age the applicant asserted that discrimination would be easy to prove if the court would help him to obtain the military service record of those four serviceman a regard the military specialist code he noted that in august he had been granted specialist code on the basis of the military code system established by the minister of defence in thus allowing him to serve until the age of after the minister of defence amended the military code system in the applicant wa given military specialist code when in the minister of defence again changed the system of military specialist code and the applicant wa transferred to the post of legal specialist no specialist code wa assigned to him the applicant observed that officer who had legal post had been given the code of legal specialist but that he a a noncommissioned officer did not have such a code above all at present no specialist code at all had been granted to him šiuo metu iš viso man nėra suteiktas joks specialisto kodas lastly the applicant strongly asserted that the lower court had erred in interpreting and applying article and other provision of lm by a decision of may the supreme administrative court dismissed the appeal in setting out the reason it observed that pursuant to article of lm a serviceman had to be dismissed from military service once his contract had expired or he had reached the age of discharge unless the duration of his military service had been extended in the applicant case a a noncommissioned officer the age of discharge for him wa the court also emphasised that that legal norm wa imperative and applied to contract which were still valid and not to those which had already expired teisės norma skirta reglamentuoti teisinius santykius dėl galiojančios o ne pasibaigusios karo tarnybos sutarties nutraukimo this interpretation also followed from article of lm which provided that a contract could be annulled ahead of time in case provided for in article of that law moreover the possibility of the applicant military service contract being rescinded had also been mentioned in the contract itself see paragraph above taking into account the imperative nature of article it wa the army command duty and not a right to rescind a contract once the condition mentioned in that provision had been met furthermore article of lm provided only discretion for and not an obligation on the minister of defence to extend a serviceman military service the supreme administrative court also noted that according to his duty the applicant did not fall into the sphere regulated by article and of the law that is he did not have military specialist status moreover exceptional extension of term of service under article had not been applied to him consequently the fact of the case fully matched the circumstance listed in article and of the law the firstinstance court decision wa thus fully upheld the appellate court did not address the applicant request for the supplementary document to be obtained nor did the court deal with the allegation of discrimination against the applicant because of his service status in addition to the administrative proceeding concerning his discharge from military service the applicant also instituted another set of somewhat linked proceeding concerning his dismissal from vaidotas battalion which formally preceded the discharge from military service he reiterated the argument expressed in the earlier proceeding in relation to freedom of expression the applicant merely mentioned that he had been persecuted for his opinion because of the legal decision he had issued which wa favourable towards another serviceman see paragraph above it also appears from the summary of the applicant complaint in the record of the court decision of july see the next paragraph that this time the applicant had made no reference to the publication in kauno diena but insisted that he had been discriminated against because of his social status a a noncommissioned officer visàvis the commissioned officer on july the vilnius regional administrative court dismissed the applicant claim fully upholding the reasoning that in accordance with article and of lm the army wa under an obligation to discharge him from the military because of his age the court also noted that the qualification required for a legal post had been established by the minister of defence on june one of the obligatory requirement wa universitylevel higher education in law aukštasis universitetinis teisinis išsilavinimas accordingly the applicant wa not qualified to be appointed to a legal post because in he had graduated from šiauliai college of law and management from the programme of higherlevel nonuniversity law study aukštųjų

applicant argument that he had a right to serve until year of age and wa not to be discharged from the army wa based only on his own idea and erroneous interpretation of the law lastly the court dismissed the applicant claim that he had been persecuted for his opinion having concluded that that claim wa based only on the applicant own supposition and guess the applicant appealed arguing that he had been persecuted because of his opinion on whether to grant childcare leave to another soldier it appears from the transcript of the hearing of his complaint in the appellate court decision that

prosecutor anna brought a civil claim against the applicant company and against rk it president and editorinchief of the magazine she claimed protection of personal right within the meaning of article and of the civil code by a judgment of september the łódź regional court allowed the claim and ordered the applicant company jointly with the magazine editorinchief to publish an apology in the magazine it wa to be published once and wa to read a follows the editor of fakty i mity apologise to m atk prosecutor at the łodź regional prosecutor office for breaching her personal right through publishing in it issue no in october untrue information namely that she had link with criminal circle involved in drug trafficking for slandering her with allegation of aiding and abetting drug dealing and for suggesting that criminal proceeding had been instituted against her they were also ordered to pay polish zloty pln to the claimant a compensation for the breach of her personal right the court established that the claimant had married mk in the marriage had been in difficulty since approximately her former husband wa a businessman he had experienced considerable financial problem since at least the de facto breakdown of their marital life had occurred in the claimant did not know anything about her husband professional activity the family had one car used essentially by the claimant former husband for business purpose however he often drove their daughter to school and the claimant to the office so that they did not have to use public transport in he left poland the party divorced in the impugned article referred to the claimant a prosecutor anna and referred to her function a the prosecutor office spokesperson the court wa of the view that it made her identity obvious to any reader familiar with legal circle in łódź it wa furthermore stated in the article that on an unspecified date she had accompanied her former husband to a meeting held somewhere in a street in łódź a certain sw remanded in custody at the time of publication of the article had told m ohb a researcher for the magazine about that transaction in which he had been involved together with pt a suspect in another set in criminal proceeding pt wa also remanded in custody at the time of publication pt had been the claimant former husband business partner since approximately he had never met the claimant but had known that she wa a prosecutor the journalist msz who wrote the article using a pseudonym had failed to take into consideration the fact that sw wa remanded in custody and that he had therefore had an interest in blackening the prosecutor name since she had been involved in certain case against him his statement should therefore not have been taken at face value m ohb had met sw in prison posing a a relative however neither the journalist nor the editor had taken any step with a view to contacting pt in order to obtain information from him that would have corroborated sw allegation the court found that the author had failed to make reasonable effort to contact the claimant before publication the effort on the part of the researcher and the journalist to get in touch with her had been completely inadequate all the more so given that they were seasoned professional the journalist maintained that he tried to call the claimant at her office at least fifty time but the evidence available to the court did not support his statement it wa further noted that other journalist had managed to contact her via her office which cast doubt on the veracity of his statement no reasonable ground had been adduced to demonstrate that it had not been possible for the defendant to get in touch with a wellknown prosecutor working at a publicly known address namely that of the prosecutor office the court noted that the claimant had acted a a prosecutor in certain criminal case against sw and pt in criminal proceeding against them in which they had been convicted of drug trafficking they had told the court that they had sold g of amphetamine to the prosecutor former husband in the presence of an unknown blonde woman who wa allegedly waiting in the car the criminal court noted that sw had told the court that the claimant former husband had informed him at the time of the transaction that the woman with him wa his wife the civil court observed that the identity of that woman had never been corroborated by any other evidence when questioned before the civil court sw stated that he had seen the woman for a matter of second and remembered that she wa blonde but did not recognise the claimant the court further observed that the claimant former husband against whom criminal proceeding were pending at that time had gone into hiding and it had been impossible to establish his whereabouts in order to make him testify in the case the court found having heard three witness from the claimant professional working environment that the impugned article made her identity obvious to anyone working in prosecutor office and to the police in łódź the article had given rise to numerous comment and conversation it wa regarded a an attempt to blacken the claimant name and to slander her motivated by the wish to damage her reputation and call into question her moral standing and professional principle it wa noted that she had been attacked by a criminal who had provided information to the journalist concerning his own criminal case after the article wa published many people did not know how to behave towards the claimant or what to think of her an embarrassing silence descended when she joined in conversation the claimant had suffered serious stress and had felt seriously wronged by the impugned article the court concluded that the article breached the claimant personal right blackened her reputation and exposed her to difficulty and disrepute in her professional and social life it lacked objectivity and wa onesided it tone wa unduly sensationalist and it presented mere conjecture a hard fact the court reiterated that a person exercising a public office should accept that his or her activity were to be assessed by the public opinion and had to accept public criticism it noted that freedom of expression could not be understood a arbitrariness it referred to the provision of section of the press act which obliged journalist to present true fact to the public the court further relied on numerous judgment of the supreme court by which that court had stressed that journalist were obliged to exercise particular diligence when gathering material and publishing article such diligence wa called for inter alia a regard the obligation to check the veracity of information obtained from third party in the present case such diligence had not been exercised while it wa true that the claimant former husband had purchased amphetamine from sw and pt no evidence had been presented to the court to show that the claimant had been present at the scene let alone acting a security for the transaction the court observed taking due note of the financial statement of the applicant company for that it wa in a good financial position and that pln in damage wa therefore an appropriate award in the circumstance of the present case the court questioned the journalist msz the researcher m ohb pt sw and three other witness a to the impact that the article had had in the claimant professional environment the court referred to a note and an email from the prosecutor office listing the people who had tried to contact the claimant by phone and to the list of phone call made to her office the applicant company appealed referring inter alia to article of the convention it submitted that the firstinstance court had erred in holding that the impugned article breached the claimant personal right given that the defendant had been motivated by the desire to protect socially justified interest that the court had refused to take evidence from the file of two criminal case with a view to establishing that the claimant had been present at the scene of the transaction and that the court had been arbitrary in establishing that the claimant had not known either what her former husband did for a living or the purpose of the meeting in the street that the information contained in the article had made it possible for reader to identify the claimant and that she had been ostracised by her colleague a a result of the article by a judgment of december the łódź court of appeal dismissed the appeal it shared the conclusion of the lower court a to the applicant company failure to act with the diligence which could and should be expected of journalist it stressed that the journalist and the researcher had failed to seek information that could have countered their version of event or dispelled doubt a to the fact it endorsed the lower court conclusion that the transaction itself had indeed taken place but that the claimant alleged involvement in it had been presented in a tendentious and unreliable manner the court referred to article of the convention and held that the interference wa necessary a the applicant company had breached the claimant right through it insinuation which were not based to any reasonable degree on the available evidence on january the supreme court dismissed the applicant company cassation appeal it observed that the impugned article concerned an event which had indeed occurred namely a drugtrafficking transaction between the claimant former husband and pt and sw however the allegation that the claimant had knowingly participated in that transaction a well a insinuation that she wa a drug addict and that she had been passing on drug on her fellow prosecutor were in the light of the evidence gathered in the case entirely unfounded her right had been thereby breached the supreme court referred to it own caselaw to the effect that journalist were obliged to be diligent when gathering material for the purpose of their article but that at the same time they had a right to draw their own conclusion from material thus gathered i ck the press act obliged them to comply with the obligation of diligence by contacting person about whom they wished to write prior to the publication of such material i csk such an obligation wa all the more important in the present case because given the claimant prosecutorial function in case against pt and sw the testimony of the latter could not be accepted uncritically the journalist had failed to try to contact the claimant had accepted sw statement in an undiscriminating manner and had failed to contact pt prior to publishing the article the supreme court acknowledged that shocking or even insulting publication were also covered by the protection of article of the convention however this protection wa not absolute it could be limited by the legitimate aim listed in paragraph of this provision journalist making allegation about individual were obliged to show that there wa sufficient factual basis for their assertion here it referred to cumpǎnǎ and mazǎre v romania gc no echr xi not only should statement of fact be consistent with the material gathered for the purpose of the press article but value judgment should also have a sound factual basis here it cited dąbrowski v poland no december these principle were equally applicable to situation where the administration of justice or judge or prosecutor were criticised by the press citing barfod v denmark february series a no prager and oberschlick v austria april series a no and lešník v slovakia no echr iv the supreme court reiterated that informing the general public of improper conduct on the part of public prosecutor served the general interest but the guarantee enshrined in article could be successfully relied on only where journalist had reliable and precise information at their disposal that could justify levelling such serious charge against public official no such factual information had been put forward by the defendant in the present case the court had not therefore erred in finding against

left pw c following his resignation an auditor ad had copied page of confidential document including page of tax document corresponding to folder of tax rescript he had handed these over to a journalist ep in the summer of at the latter request a second internal investigation by pw c led to the applicant identification following the medias disclosure about certain of the tax rescript copied by ad the applicant had contacted ep in may offering to hand over other document the journalist eventually agreed to this offer and the sixteen document specifically fourteen tax declaration

after the first broadcast on and november the sixteen document were also put online by an association of journalist known a the international consortium of investigative journalist icij it author described this publication a luxleaks it appears from press article that the luxleaks affair led to a difficult year for pw c but that once this period had passed the company experienced a growth in turnover which wa accompanied by a significant increase in it workforcethe criminal proceeding brought in the case on a complaint by pw c ad the applicant and ep were charged by an investigating judge and committed for trial before the luxembourg district court by the investigating court the firstinstance judgment on june the luxembourg district court ruling on major offence convicted ad and the applicant of theft from one employer vol domestique fraudulent access to a system for the processing or automatic transmission of data betrayal of commercial secret breach of professional confidence and laundering and possession blanchimentdétention ad wa sentenced to a twelvemonth prison term suspended in it entirety and to a fine of euro eur the applicant wa sentenced to a ninemonth prison term suspended in it entirety and a fine of eur in addition they were ordered to pay a symbolic sum of one euro to pw c a civillaw compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage pw c having limited it claim a the civil party to that amount ep wa acquitted on the ground that he had not taken part for the purpose of the law a a coperpetrator or accomplice in the applicant betrayal of commercial secret or breach of professional confidence judgment of the court of appeal ad and the applicant lodged criminallaw and civillaw appeal against the above judgment the public prosecutor lodged a criminallaw appeal against the same judgment in respect of the ad the applicant and ep on march the court of appeal of the grand duchy of luxembourg delivered it judgment before analysing the merit of the case the court of appeal noted that the applicant public accusation through communication of the tax declaration of multinational company were related to the practice initially criticised by ad of issuing tax rescript that were advantageous to these multinational company in the same context it also stated that under the caselaw of the european court of human right the lawfulness or illegality of the disclosed act or conduct is not a criterion in decided whether to grant whistleblower status since the disclosed information might even concern a particular shortcoming or questionable practice a to the merit the court of appeal decided for various reason related to the domestic criminal law not to examine certain charge brought against ad or the applicant namely breaching commercial secrecy or accordingly laundering and possession or laundering and possession of the proceeds of computerrelated fraud it ruled that in the light of the domestic criminal law alone the firstinstance court had been correct in finding that ad and the applicant had committed the offence of theft from one employer fraudulent or retained access to a data processing or automatic transmission system breach of professional confidence and laundering and possession of the proceeds of theft from one employer it held that contrary to the finding of the firstinstance court ep ought to have been regarded a complicit in the breach of professional confidence committed by the applicant and in the laundering and possession of the proceeds of theft from one employer also committed by him the court of appeal then examined whether or not these offence which had been established and were in principle to be considered a proven could be held to be justified under article of the convention it explained that under luxembourg law the acceptance of whistleblowing a a defence derived from article of the convention had the effect of neutralising the illegal nature of the breach of the law it specified that it wa the statutory element of the offence which wa necessarily committed through the disclosure in good faith and in a proportionate and appropriate manner of information in the general interest which wa thus neutralised and led to the defendant acquittal with regard to ep it held that he wa to be recognised a enjoying the defence of having acted a a responsible journalist derived by the court from article of the convention in consequence it confirmed on this ground eps full acquittal with regard to ad and the applicant it applied the court caselaw on the protection of whistleblower referring in particular to guja v moldova gc no echr it reiterated that this caselaw made protection of whistleblower subject to compliance with six condition which it then analysed it reasoning may be summarised a follows analysis of the first four guja criterion the court of appeal noted in application of this caselaw that the revelation were in the public interest the first criterion in that they had opened the way for a public debate in europe and luxembourg about the taxation of multinational company fiscal transparency the practice of tax rescript and tax fairness in general it added that following the luxleaks disclosure the european commission had presented a range of measure against tax evasion and an action plan for fair and effective corporate taxation in the european union the court of appeal also held that the information disclosed had been authentic the second criterion with regard to the third criterion namely that disclosing the information to the public could only be considered a a last resort where it wa clearly impracticable to do otherwise the court of appeal considered that having regard to the circumstance of the case informing the public through the medium had been the only realistic alternative in order to raise the alert it accepted that the fourth criterion that of good faith had been met in the applicant case in the case of ad it held that this criterion had been complied with in the summer of when he handed over the document which he had taken in october to ep in contrast it held that ad had not complied with this criterion when taking possession of the document given that he had not yet intended at that point to make them public analysis of the fifth guja criterion the court of appeal then analysed the criterion which required the public interest in obtaining the information to be balanced against the harm suffered by the employer a a result of the information revealed the fifth criterion in so far a the applicant argued that pw c had not suffered any harm pointing out that the company had even announced an increase in it turnover and number of employee the court of appeal after reviewing the court various judgment in this area noted a follows the european court doe not analyse the harm sustained in specific term but considers that the harm caused to the employer may result from damage to it image loss of confidence and in general from the impact that the report may have had on the public the higher the public profile of the case and thus of the information that the employer wished to keep secret the more the public confidence is shaken it also stated there is accordingly no need to ascertain whether a a result of ad and the applicant disclosure pw c turnover ha decreased or whether client have complained brought civilliability proceeding or closed their account with pw cthe court of appeal note that the fact of disclosing document subject to business and professional secrecy ha certainly caused harm to pw c specifically nonpecuniary harm a a victim of criminal offence resulting from the damage to it reputation and the loss of client confidence with regard to the security procedure in place in the company furthermore and more specifically in the context of the information provided concerning the applicant it pointed out that in the present case pw c ha been associated with a practice of tax evasion if not with a taxoptimisation procedure described a unacceptable it ha been the victim of criminal offence and ha necessarily suffered harm it went on to weigh up the public interest on the one hand against pw c interest on the other and found with regard to ad that the public interest clearly outweighed any harm that may have been sustained by pw c and it client it therefore held that this criterion had been complied with in respect of ad in contrast in the applicant case the court of appeal held that the disclosure of the document had caused pw c harm that wa greater than the general interest with the result that the fifth criterion had not been fulfilled it found that the defence argument that the applicant should be granted whistleblower status could not be accepted for the following reason the document handed over by the applicant to the journalist did not contribute to the public debate on the luxembourg practice of tax rescript trigger a debate on tax evasion or provide essential new and previously unknown information in reaching this conclusion it relied on the following argument in contrast to the document disclosed by ad the document selected by the applicant were not administrative ruling and did not illustrate the application of the tax rescript system they were simple tax declaration that is unilateral statement by taxpayer concerning their financial situation which did not permit the tax authority attitude towards them to be ascertained thus these document did not reveal any information about the tax optimisation technique and were of limited relevance nor had they been selected by the applicant in order to provide additional information about the tax rescript already in the possession of ep for example in order to illustrate how these tax rescript were reflected in the corresponding tax declaration they had been selected solely on the basis of how wellknown the relevant taxpayer wa when the applicant appropriated the document and transmitted them to the journalist the practice of tax rescript had already been disclosed through the document which were transmitted by ad and publicised on the occasion of the first cash investigation programme the applicant had been aware of this circumstance thus there had been no compelling reason for the applicant to commit a fresh violation of the law by appropriating and disclosing confidential document the document had been used by ep to prepare a part of the second cash investigation programme a section on tax evasion and the billion we are missing rather than on the practice of tax rescript the document were used to illustrate tax evasion by two group of multinational company a and am explored in the report according to ep in the case of company a the tax declaration had allowed him to illustrate that the group had declared a significant turnover in luxembourg without however engaging in the corresponding commercial activity in that country the journalist criticised the following procedure with regard to company am he reported that this group had transferred eur million to a subsidiary governed by luxembourg law in order to repay the interest on a loan that it had granted to this subsidiary the subsidiary wa able to deduct the amount in question which wa then transferred to another company in the same group located in dubai where it enjoyed full tax exemption the court of appeal considered that the information in relation to the two group of company could admittedly be regarded a alarming and scandalous but that it did not constitute essential or fundamentally new information thus it concluded that the tax return handed over by the applicant merely confirmed the result of the journalistic investigation carried out by eps team and that a such they were certainly useful to the journalist but did not however provide any previously unknown cardinal information capable of relaunching or contributing to the debate on tax evasion analysis of the sixth guja criterion with regard to the sixth criterion concerning the proportionality of the penalty the court of appeal made a distinction between the two defendant it held that ad who wa entitled to rely on the defence of whistleblowing with regard to the offence of handing over the document to the journalist ep in the summer of wa to be absolved of any criticism with regard to those event and thus acquitted of the offence of a breach of professional secrecy with regard to those of his action that were not covered by this defence namely those concerning the appropriation of document in october the court of appeal reduced the prison sentence to six month suspended in it entirety and upheld the fine of eur with regard to the applicant the court of appeal held that there had been a plurality of offence so that under the domestic criminal law the most severe penalty could be doubled namely a prison term of between three month and five year and a fine of eur to noting also that the applicant could not benefit from the defence of having acted a a whistleblower it decided nonetheless to have regard a an extenuating circumstance to the motive honourable in his view which had driven him to act and to the disinterested nature of his act in consequence it decided not to impose a prison term and to maintain the fine of eur the court of appeal upheld the civillaw judgment ordering ad and the applicant to pay the symbolic sum of one euro a compensation for the nonpecuniary damage sustained by pw c the court of cassations judgment in respect of ad and the applicant ad and the applicant appealed on point of law against the court of appeal judgment the court of cassations judgment in respect of the applicant in a judgment no criminal division of january the court of cassation dismissed the applicant appeal on point of law the applicant had submitted a legal argument alleging a violation by the court of appeal of article of the convention stating inter alia the court of appeal ha misrepresented the fact and the caselaw of the european court of human right and interpreted in a tendentious manner the limited relevance of the document handed over to ep leading it to find that the harm suffered by the employer wa greater than the general interest and to reject the defence of whistleblowing given it conclusion that the criterion of the proportionality of the harm caused in relation to the general interest wa not fulfilled in the discussion of the argument the applicant had emphasised by way of example that the appendix to the tax return filed by group a see paragraph above referred to annual general meeting which had an average duration of one minute which sufficed to demonstrate a total lack of genuine substance in luxembourg he stressed that the tax return that he had communicated made it possible to verify the economic reality of the entity set up in luxembourg and thus to analyse the practice of using tax rescript in response to this argument the court of cassation held inter alia assessment of the fact which must underlie a decision a to whether a defendant can benefit from the defence of whistleblower status fall within the sovereign domain of the judge invested with jurisdiction over the merit and is not subject to review by the court of cassation provided that this assessment is not deduced from reason that are insufficient or contradictory in the present case the appellate court based their assessment on the nature of the document removed by the applicant the use of those document in the context of a television programme on tax evasion the statement made by the applicant and by ep concerning the relevance of the document in question and concluded that the tax return removed by the applicant while they had undoubtedly been useful to the journalist ep did not however provide any cardinal information hitherto unknown that wa capable of relaunching or contributing to the debate on tax evasion contrary to the applicant argument the factual finding reached by the appellate court are not contradictory the appellate court assessment wa thus based on reason that were adequate and free from contradiction the court of cassations judgment in respect of ad in contrast the appeal on point of law lodged by ad wa granted by the court of cassation in it judgment no criminal division of january it quashed the court of appeal judgment on the ground that whistleblower status ought in principle to be granted concerning all offence for which a person who had availed himself or herself of the right guaranteed by article of the convention wa prosecuted failing which the protection that ought to arise from whistleblower status would be rendered ineffective the court of cassation thus held that the court of appeal had infringed article of the convention by refusing to allow ad to rely on the defence of whistleblowing regarding the appropriation of the document handed over in october given that it had accepted this defence with regard to the handing over of these document to the journalist ep in the summer of d the court of appeal remittal judgment with regard to ad in a judgment of may the court of appeal held that following the court of cassations judgment ad ought to be acquitted on the basis of article of the convention of all the offence committed with regard to the document handed over to ep in the summer of including the offence related to the appropriation of these document in october the court of appeal decided however that the first appellate judgment had become final and thus remained valid in respect of ad concerning these same offence in so far a they related to the internal training document that he had also appropriated in october when appropriating the tax document that were subsequently transmitted to ep in this connection it limited itself to suspending the pronouncement of the sentence this judgment

day that the comment by lr were still there while those posted by sb had indeed disappeared for his part lr wa identified a being an employee of nîmes town council when interviewed by the gendarme on january he explained that he worked a an assistant in the applicant election campaign and denied that his comment had been racist or an incitement to racial hatred explaining that he had never

hairdressing salon he added that he had informed the applicant later that day of his altercation with lt on january the applicant wa also interviewed by the investigator recalling that he had been a candidate in nîmes standing against fp lts partner he explained that he had been unable to monitor the large number of comment posted each week on the wall of his facebook account he indicated in particular that he had not written the impugned comment himself he had not had the time to delete the comment by sb who had already done so he had only become aware of lr comment when he wa summoned to the gendarmerie and he wa prepared to delete them if the court so requested he consulted his facebook wall every day but did not often read the comment which were too numerous given that he had more than friend who could post comment hour a day and that he preferred to post content to inform his reader lt whom he knew only by her partner surname had not been mentioned by name and he had not been aware of her forename until she filed a complaint lt had once personally taken him to task at a polling station she should have telephoned him to ask him to delete these comment which would have obviated the need for a criminal complaint but her aim had clearly been to destabilise his candidature a he wa standing against her partner instead lt had gone to the hairdressing salon of sb whom she knew to insult and threaten him in front of witness lastly he knew lr and sb activist in his party who did not hold any office in it referring to his foreign origin he added that he had never displayed any racism or discrimination against anyone and that he did not perceive any call to murder or violence in the disputed remark which he considered to be within the limit of any citizen freedom of expression he emphasised that he had removed public access to his facebook wall a few day before this interview in order to limit access only to those who chose to be his friend and to avoid any further incident that were not of his making after the interview the investigator were able to confirm that the applicant facebook page wa indeed no longer accessible to the public the applicant together with sb and lr were summoned to appear before nîmes criminal court in connection with the publication of the comment in question on the wall of his facebook account to answer charge of incitement to hatred or violence against a group and in particular lt on account of their origin or the fact of belonging or not belonging to a specific ethnicity nation race or religion the summons referred to section first paragraph section eighth paragraph and section of the law of july and section of law no of july in a judgment of february the nîmes criminal court found the applicant sb and lr guilty a charged and ordered each of them to pay a fine of euro eur the applicant wa convicted under section first paragraph and section eighth paragraph of the law of july and section of law no of july sb and the applicant were also ordered jointly to pay eur to lt a civil party in compensation for nonpecuniary damage however the court did not see fit to order the sanction of electoral disqualification that had been called for by the public prosecutor in it judgment the court began by finding that the various offending comment had specifically defined the group concerned namely muslim to equate that group with drug dealer and prostitute who reign supreme riff raff who sell drug all day long or those responsible for throwing stone at car belonging to white people wa clearly likely on account of both the meaning and scope of the comment to arouse a strong feeling of rejection or hostility towards people who belonged or were assumed to belong to the muslim community it further took the view that lt could be regarded a having been provoked by the impugned comment in view of the reference to her partner and the wording thanks f and kiss to l which had had the effect of portraying them both a being responsible for the alleged transformation of nîmes into algiers and to arouse hatred or violence against them a regard the applicant the court observed that it could be inferred from section of the law of july a interpreted by the constitutional council in it decision of september that the criminal liability of the producer of a website intended for communication to the general public including access to message posted by it user would only be engaged in respect of such message if it could be established that the producer had been aware of their content before they were posted or if not if he or she failed to act promptly to delete the message at issue upon becoming aware of them it dismissed the applicant argument according to which he had not had time to read the comment and that he had not been aware of the comment by sb and lr on the ground that first comment could only be posted on his wall after he had given access to his friend of which there were at october and that he wa responsible for checking the content of the post second he must have been aware that his page wa likely to attract comment with a political and thus essential polemical content and that he should have been all the more careful to monitor them the court concluded that having set up an electronic public communication service on his own initiative for the purpose of exchanging opinion and having left the offending comment which had remained visible a of december according to the investigator the applicant had failed to act promptly to put an end to their dissemination and wa therefore guilty in his capacity a principal the applicant and sb appealed sb subsequently withdrew his appeal in a judgment of october the nîmes court of appeal upheld the applicant conviction reducing the fine to eur it further ordered him to pay lt eur in cost for the appeal proceeding in it reasoning the court of appeal held that the criminal court had been correct in finding that the comment clearly defined the group of people concerned namely muslim and that to associate the muslim community with crime and insecurity in the city of nîmes wa likely to arouse a strong feeling of rejection or hostility towards that group noting that the legislation cited in the proceeding concerned discrimination against a person or group of person it found a follows the expression kiss to leila referring to lt and her connection with fp deputy mayor of nîmes who is described in the post a having contributed to the abandonment of the town of nîmes to the muslim and thus to insecurity is such a to associate her with the transformation of the town and thus to arouse hatred or violence against her on the basis of these element the two post in question constitute incitement to hatred or violence against a person namely fps partner lt on account of a presumption because of her forename that she belonged to a muslim community referring further to the provision of section of the law of july and to the fact of the case the court of appeal noted that there wa no evidence that the applicant had been informed of the content of the comment before they were posted but that in his capacity a an elected member of the front national and a public figure he had knowingly made his facebook wall public and had therefore authorised his friend to post comment on it the court continued it reasoning a follows by thus acting voluntarily he became responsible for the content of the comment posted his status a a political figure required him to be all the more vigilant he can not claim not to have been aware of the comment posted on his website on october especially a he stated during the investigation that he consulted it every day he did not however remove the comment which were subsequently deleted by s b himself alerted by the latter to the reaction of the civil party he did not delete lr comment either and the latter wa still present on his website when consulted by the investigator on december he can not be regarded a the court below rightly found a having promptly put an end to the dissemination of the offending comment he legitimised his position by explaining that such comment appeared to him to be compatible with freedom of expression the fact they were left on his wall wa thus deliberate on his part in the light of these element the court below wa right to find the defendant guilty a charged and the judgment is upheld in respect of his conviction the applicant appealed to the court of cassation relying in particular on article of the convention in a single ground of appeal he argued that for the offence to be made out the comment had to contain encouragement or incitement to discrimination hatred or violence and not merely give rise to a strong feeling of rejection or hostility towards a group or person that the mere fear of a risk of racism could not deprive citizen of the freedom to express their view on the consequence of immigration in certain town or neighbourhood the comment having specifically deplored the transformation of the town of nîmes by immigrant of north african origin and of the muslim faith that the summons to appear before the court had been unlawful and lastly that the impugned remark had in no way been directed at lt personally and had been distorted by the court of appeal in a judgment of march the court of cassation dismissed his appeal in particular with regard to article of the convention stating a follows first the offence of incitement is established where a in the present case the court find that by both their meaning and their scope the impugned text may arouse a feeling of rejection or hostility hatred or violence towards a group or an individual on account of a particular religion second since the abovementioned text fall within the restriction provided for in paragraph of article of the european convention on human right the

dc of june declaring numerous provision to be unconstitutional created an online hate observatory it mission is to monitor and analyse development in this area by involving operator in particular of social network such a facebook association authority and researcher concerned with the combat against and prevention of such act working group have been tasked with reflecting on the concept of hateful content improving knowledge of this phenomenon analysing the mechanism of dissemination and the mean of combating it and lastly ensuring prevention education and support for internet user the said law also led to the creation of a national unit for combating online hate within the paris tribunal judiciaire which started operating in january it exercise jurisdiction based on the complexity of the procedure or the extent of the breach of public order which may stem in particular from the high medium profile or particular sensitivity of a given case circular of november on the combat against online hate crim e international instrument internet communication the relevant text adopted by the council of europe committee of minister and the united nation can be found in paragraph to of the judgment in delfi a v estonia gc no echr hate speech united nationsa human right council in his report submitted in accordance with human right council resolution a september the special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression mr frank la rue made the following observation while some of the above concept may overlap the special rapporteur considers the following element to be essential when determining whether an expression constitutes incitement to hatred real and imminent danger of violence resulting from the expression intent of the speaker to incite discrimination hostility or violence and careful consideration by the judiciary of the context in which hatred wa expressed given that international law prohibits some form of speech for their consequence and not for their content a such because what is deeply offensive in one community may not be so in another accordingly any contextual assessment must include consideration of various factor including the existence of pattern of tension between religious or racial community discrimination against the targeted group the tone and content of the speech the person inciting hatred and the mean of disseminating the expression of hate for example a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of facebook user doe not carry the same weight a a statement published on a mainstream website similarly artistic expression should be considered with reference to it artistic value and context given that art may be used to provoke strong feeling without the intention of inciting violence discrimination or hostility moreover while state are required to prohibit by law any advocacy of national racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence under article of the covenant there is no requirement to criminalize such expression the special rapporteur underscore that only serious and extreme instance of incitement to hatred which would cross the sevenpart threshold should be criminalized in other case the special rapporteur is of the view that state should adopt civil law with the application of diverse remedy including procedural remedy for example access to justice and ensuring effectiveness of domestic institution and substantive remedy for example reparation that are adequate prompt and proportionate to the gravity of the expression which may include restoring reputation preventing recurrence and providing financial compensation in addition while some type of expression may raise concern in term of tolerance civility and respect for others there are instance in which neither criminal nor civil sanction are justified the special rapporteur wish to reiterate that the right to freedom of expression includes form of expression that are offensive disturbing and shocking indeed since not all type of inflammatory hateful or offensive speech amount to incitement the two should not be conflatedb committee on the elimination of racial discrimination general recommendation no of september on combating racist hate speech provides guideline on the requirement of the international convention on the elimination of all form of racial discrimination the aim being to help the state party to fulfil their obligation it is indicated in particular a follows racist hate speech addressed in committee practice ha included all the specific speech form referred to in article directed against group recognized in article of the convention which forbids discrimination on ground of race colour descent or national or ethnic origin such a indigenous people descentbased group and immigrant or noncitizen including migrant domestic worker refugee and asylum seeker a well a speech directed against woman member of these and other vulnerable group in the light of the principle of intersectionality and bearing in mind that criticism of religious leader or commentary on religious doctrine or tenet of faith should not be prohibited or punished the committee attention ha also been engaged by hate speech targeting person belonging to certain ethnic group who profess or practice a religion different from the majority including expression of islamophobia anti semitism and other similar manifestation of hatred against ethnoreligious group a well a extreme manifestation of hatred such a incitement to genocide and to terrorism stereotyping and stigmatization of member of protected group ha also been the subject of expression of concern and recommendation adopted by the committee racist hate speech can take many form and is not confined to explicitly racial remark a is the case with discrimination under article speech attacking particular racial or ethnic group may employ indirect language in order to disguise it target and objective in line with their obligation under the convention state party should give due attention to all manifestation of racist hate speech and take effective measure to combat them the principle articulated in the present recommendation apply to racist hate speech whether emanating from individual or group in whatever form it manifest itself orally or in print or disseminated through electronic medium including the internet and social networking site a well a nonverbal form of expression such a the display of racist symbol image and behaviour at public gathering including sporting event on the qualification of dissemination and incitement a offence punishable by law the committee considers that the following contextual factor should be taken into account the content and form of speech whether the speech is provocative and direct in what form it is constructed and disseminated and the style in which it is delivered the economic social and political climate prevalent at the time the speech wa made and disseminated including the existence of pattern of discrimination against ethnic and other group including indigenous people discourse which in one context are innocuous or neutral may take on a dangerous significance in another in it indicator on genocide the committee emphasized the relevance of locality in appraising the meaning and potential effect of racist hate speech the position or status of the speaker in society and the audience to which the speech is directed the committee consistently draw attention to the role of politician and other public opinionformers in contributing to the creation of a negative climate towards group protected by the convention and ha encouraged such person and body to adopt positive approach directed to the promotion of intercultural understanding and harmony the committee is aware of the special importance of freedom of speech in political matter and also that it exercise carry with it special duty and responsibility the reach of the speech including the nature of the audience and the mean of transmission whether the speech wa disseminated through mainstream medium or the internet and the frequency and extent of the communication in particular when repetition suggests the existence of a deliberate strategy to engender hostility towards ethnic and racial group the objective of the speech speech protecting or defending the human right of individual and group should not be subject to criminal or other sanction informed ethical and objective medium including social medium and the internet have an essential role in promoting responsibility in the dissemination of idea and opinion in addition to putting in place appropriate legislation for the medium in line with international standard state party should encourage the public and private medium to adopt code of professional ethic and press code that incorporate respect for the principle of the convention and other fundamental human right standard the council of europea the committee of minister the annex to recommendation no r of the council of europe committee of minister on hate speech adopted on october provides in particular a follows scope the principle set out hereafter apply to hate speech in particular hate speech disseminated through the medium for the purpose of the application of these principle the term hate speech shall be understood a covering all form of expression which spread incite promote or justify racial hatred xenophobia anti semitism or other form of hatred based on intolerance including intolerance expressed by aggressive nationalism and ethnocentrism discrimination and hostility against minority migrant and people of immigrant origin principle the government of the member state public authority and public institution at the national regional and local level a well a official have a special responsibility to refrain from statement in particular to the medium which may reasonably be understood a hate speech or a speech likely to produce the effect of legitimising spreading or promoting racial hatred xenophobia anti semitism or other form of discrimination or hatred based on intolerance such statement should be prohibited and publicly disavowed whenever they occur principle national law and practice should allow the court to bear in mind that specific instance of hate speech may be so insulting to individual or group a not to enjoy the level of protection afforded by article of the european convention on human right to other form of expression this is the case where hate speech is aimed at the destruction of the right and freedom laid down in the convention or at their limitation to a greater extent than provided therein principle national law and practice should allow the competent prosecution authority to give special attention a far a their discretion permit to case involving hate speech in this regard these authority should in particular give careful consideration to the suspect right to freedom of expression given that the imposition of criminal sanction generally constitutes a serious interference with that freedom the competent court should when imposing criminal sanction on person convicted of hate speech offence ensure strict respect for the principle of proportionality principle national law and practice in the area of hate speech should take due account of the role of the medium in communicating information and idea which expose analyse and explain specific instance of hate speech and the underlying phenomenon in general a well a the right of the public to receive such information and idea to this end national law and practice should distinguish clearly between the responsibility of the author of expression of hate speech on the one hand and any responsibility of the medium and medium professional contributing to their dissemination a part of their mission to communicate information and idea on matter of public interest on the other handb european commission against racism and intolerance ecri the relevant passage of ecris general policy recommendation no on combating hate speech adopted on december read a follows the european commission against racism and intolerance ecritaking note of the differing way in which hate speech ha been defined and is understood at the national and international level a well a of the different form that it can take considering that hate speech is to be understood for the purpose of the present general policy recommendation a the advocacy promotion or incitement in any form of the denigration hatred or vilification of a person or group of person a well a any harassment insult negative stereotyping stigmatization or threat in respect of such a person or group of person and the justification of all the preceding type of expression on the ground of race colour descent national or ethnic origin age disability language religion or belief sex gender gender identity sexual orientation and other personal characteristic or status recognising also that form of expression that offend shock or disturb will not on that account alone amount to hate speech and that action against the use of hate speech should serve to protect individual and group of person rather than particular belief ideology or religion recognising that the use of hate speech can reflect or promote the unjustified assumption that the user is in some way superior to a person or a group of person that is or are targeted by it recognising that the use of hate speech may be intended to incite or reasonably expected to have the effect of inciting others to commit act of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those who are targeted by it and that this is an especially serious form of such speech recognising that the use of hate speech appears to be increasing especially through electronic form of communication which magnify it impact but that it exact extent remains unclear because of the lack of systematic reporting and collection of data on it occurrence and that this need to be remedied particularly through the provision of appropriate support for those targeted or affected by it aware that ignorance and insufficient medium literacy a well a alienation discrimination indoctrination and marginalisation can be exploited to encourage the use of hate speech without the real character and consequence of such speech being fully appreciated stressing the importance of education in undermining the misconception and misinformation that form the basis of hate speech and of the need for such education to be directed in particular to the young recognising that an important mean of tackling hate speech is through confronting and condemning it directly by counterspeech that clearly show it destructive and unacceptable character recognising that politician religious and community leader and others in public life have a particularly important responsibility in this regard because of their capacity to exercise influence over a wide audience conscious of the particular contribution that all form of medium whether online or offline can play both in disseminating and combating hate speech recommends that the government of member state take appropriate and effective action against the use in a public context of hate speech which is intended or can reasonably be expected to incite act of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those targeted by it through the use of the criminal law provided that no other le restrictive measure would be effective and the right to freedom of expression and opinion is respected and accordinglya ensure that the offence are clearly defined and take due account of the need for a criminal sanction to be appliedb ensure that the scope of these offence is defined in a manner that permit their application to keep pace with technological developmentsc ensure that prosecution for these offence are brought on a nondiscriminatory basis and are not used in order to suppress criticism of official policy political opposition or religious beliefsd ensure the effective participation of those targeted by hate speech in the relevant proceedingse provide penalty for these offence that take account both of the serious consequence of hate speech and the need for a proportionate responsef monitor the effectiveness of the investigation of complaint and the prosecution of offender with a view to enhancing both of these in it explanatory memorandum ecri provides the following clarification the recommendation further recognises that in some instance a particular feature of the use of hate speech is that it may be intended to incite or can reasonably be expected to have the effect of inciting others to commit act of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination against those targeted by it a the definition above make clear the element of incitement entail there being either a clear intention to bring about the commission of act of violence intimidation hostility or discrimination or an imminent risk of such act occurring a a consequence of the particular hate speech used intent to incite might be established where there is an unambiguous call by the person using hate speech for others to commit the relevant act or it might be inferred from the strength of the language used and other relevant circumstance such a the previous conduct of the speaker

host on may the national radio and television council εθνικό συμβούλιο ραδιοτηλεόρασης following an invitation to the applicant company held a hearing in which the applicant company wa represented by it attorney a can be seen from the minute of the meeting the applicant company attorney acknowledged the use of hidden camera in the abovementioned incident they argued that such use had been justified owing to ac being a public figure and that it had served the public interest a proven by the fact that the report had resulted in ac being dismissed from the parliamentary group of the political party for which he had been elected a parliamentary deputy in their view that had been the result not only of ac gambling activity but also of the fact that he had tried to negotiate with the applicant company reporter to present the incident differently the applicant company attorney further argued that the use of a hidden camera had been exceptional and had been resorted to following the receipt of information that could not have been verified otherwise a nobody would have believed the journalist allegation if they had reported on the issue without broadcasting the image it can also be seen from the minute that the member of the national radio and television council expressed their disagreement regarding the use of a hidden camera arguing that if anyone were able to use a hidden camera by claiming that there wa an overriding public interest in doing so then all citizen especially if they were public figure would be exposed to the possibility of being subject to pressure and extortion they furthermore stressed that nobody would ever forbid journalist to report on a certain issue however the mean used raised an issue a the use of hidden camera could be accepted only in respect of a national security issue or for the prevention of a serious crime or other similar situation they also noted that there were two separate issue in the instant case on the one hand the use of a hidden camera and on the other hand the entrapment of ac by it decision the national radio and television council ordered the applicant company to pay one hundred thousand euro eur for each of the two television show during which the abovementioned video were shown a well a to broadcast on three day in a row on it main news show the content of that decision the decision included a short description of the three video a citation of the relevant legislation and the conclusion that the use of hidden camera in that case had not been in accordance with the relevant law it further stated that the sanction had been imposed following an assessment of the gravity of the offence of the number of viewer of the two television show of the size of the investment that had been

communicated to the minister of press and medium who after examining it legality issued decision no e confirming it content on april the applicant company lodged an application for annulment αίτηση ακύρωσης against the decision of the national radio and television council and the minister of press and medium with the supreme administrative court συμβούλιο της επικρατείας on the ground that the abovementioned decision had violated article and of the greek constitution a well a article of the convention ac lodged a thirdparty intervention requesting from the supreme administrative court to dismiss the application for annulment on january the president of the supreme administrative court referred the case to the plenary supreme administrative court owing to it high importance the hearing before the plenary supreme administrative court took place on june by it judgment no published on april and finalised on may δημοσίευση και καθαρογραφή the supreme administrative court dismissed the application for annulment in it legal assessment the majority of the supreme administrative court firstly referred to the constitutional provision providing the right to impart and receive information and then emphasised that this right is subject to limitation whose legitimate aim is the protection of the right of others and the observance of the rule of law on condition that those limitation are proportionate it additionally referred to the court caselaw in respect of article and on article with specific reference to caselaw concerning the protection of a person image see von hannover v germany no echr vi schüssel v austria dec no february and sciacca v italy no echr i it continued by noting that under article of the constitution the state ha the legal duty to exercise control over the radio and television in order to ensure respect for human value and that sanction imposed by the national radio and television council served that purpose the supreme administrative court laid down the condition under which it is legitimate to broadcast an image that ha been filmed with the method of hidden camera by making a distinction between reporting on specific news whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret mean and the broadcasting of the relevant secretly recorded image according to that reasoning recording by secret mean an image which ha a it main or only subject a specific person constitutes in principle a violation of that person right to his own image which is protected by article of the constitution and of the convention a a specific aspect of the right to respect for one private life consequently the broadcasting on television of news whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret mean can not in principle be considered a constituting the legitimate exercise of the right to impart information given that the disseminated news ha been received under circumstance which constitute a violation of an individual right to his own image nevertheless in certain case it may be considered justified to broadcast such news on account of it contribution to a debate of general interest and taking into account the secretly recorded person position or standing however even when broadcasting of the news is considered a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information this doe not automatically render legitimate the broadcasting of the relevant secretly recorded image a that constitutes a much more intense έντονος limitation of the constitutionally protected right of that person to his own image than the simple transmission of news in the domestic court view broadcasting of a secretly recorded image can only be justified if the legitimate for the reason mentioned above broadcasting of such news is completely impossible or particularly difficult without broadcasting the image that wa recorded by hidden mean and which constitutes the source of the news by applying the abovementioned principle to the circumstance of the case the supreme administrative court dismissed the applicant company argument that it had legitimately transmitted the news concerning ac in view of ac capacity a a public figure the domestic court stressed that from the text of the decision and from the minute of the meeting of the national radio and television council it derived that the sanction wa imposed to the applicant company solely and exclusively on account of the broadcast of the image that had been recorded by hidden mean and not on account of the transmission of the news whose source had been the secretly recorded image a far a the broadcasting of the image wa concerned the applicant company had not disputed that the image had been recorded by secret mean and had not claimed that broadcasting of the news wa absolutely impossible or extremely difficult without broadcasting the relevant image therefore the applicant company allegation that it had broadcast the impugned image for reason of journalistic interest and of public interest wa dismissed on the basis of the abovementioned reasoning the supreme administrative court ruled that the decision of the national radio and television council had been fully reasoned and dismissed the applicant company application for annulment a concurring more specific ειδικότερη opinion wa joined to the majority opinion the seven judge considered that the recording of a person without his knowledge and the use of it for the broadcasting of news constituted a direct violation of that person right to dignity a it reduces him to an instrument for others to achieving goal that are irrelevant to him given that pursuant to article and of the constitution the protection of human dignity is absolute the broadcasting of such news is always forbidden irrespective of whether such a broadcast includes the image in question for those reason the judge who supported this opinion considered that the application for annulment should be dismissed in addition there were two dissenting opinion according to the first one in view of the fact that the national radio and television council had considered that the broadcasting of news that had been recorded by secret mean had constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information the same consideration should be extended to the broadcasting of the relevant image the reason for this wa the special nature of television in comparison with the other medium owing to which the broadcasting of the image went handinhand with broadcasting the news itself therefore the application for annulment should have been allowed given that the national radio and television council decision had been based solely on the fact that the image of ac had been recorded by hidden mean without considering whether broadcasting news whose source wa the above image constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information lastly according to the other dissenting opinion no constitutional provision justified the absolute protection of an image a wa held by the majority a person right to his own image wa susceptible to limitation that varied according to that person position and the space in which the recording in question had taken place for individual protection against the recording of their image without their consent wa absolute irrespective of whether it took place in a public or private space unless the recording wa not directed to them or the recording of the image took place with a view to the prevention of crime in public space for public figure however protection wa le absolute in particular public figure such a politician were exposed to publicity and sometimes they even pursued it a a result there wa a legitimate expectation on the part of the medium and of the public to impart and receive information regarding their public activity for these person there wa an absolute protection of their image in their private space and in public space in which they shared private or family moment when however public figure were in public space but not under the condition described above or acted in a way that wa of interest to the public such a in case in which they engaged in behaviour contrary to what their public role entailed or contrary to the image they projected towards the public then the right to receive and impart information could justify the recording of that person without his consent and the broadcasting of the relevant image by the medium in this regard the dissenting judge argued that it would be inconceivable to equate radio with television a they did not operate on the same way therefore it would not be possible for a television show to simply announce the news without broadcasting the relevant image a would be the case on the radio in respect of legitimately recorded image when there is a balance between transparency and the right to receive information on the one hand and the protection of a person image on the other hand the presumption should be that the recorded image could be broadcast without consent in view of the above the four judge considered that the application for annulment should be allowed taking into account especially the fact that ac wa a public figure that the recording of his image had taken place in a public space that is to say in a gambling arcade and that the broadcasting of the relevant image had served the purpose of informing the public of behaviour on the part of a member of parliament that did not meet the requirement of his position therefore the television channel decision to broadcast the image a a part of the television show which otherwise could be considered unfounded or even defamatory had not breached the proportionality principle ii relevant domestic lawa the constitution the relevant article of the greek constitution provide a follows article a all person have the
